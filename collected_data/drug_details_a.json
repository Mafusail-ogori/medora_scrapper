The remaining experiences consisted of \n  slight fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, nausea or vomiting. None of these \n  events were judged to require medical intervention. Symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity have been noted in a limited number \n  of patients. Onset of such symptoms has occurred during or shortly after infusions; \n  these symptoms have included pruritus, flushing, urticaria/angioedema (a small \n  number of patients have had upper airway involvement), chest discomfort, respiratory \n  symptoms, nausea and abdominal cramping. Hypotension has been reported to occur \n  during a few of these events. (See WARNINGS.)

    "sideEffects": "AUGMENTIN is generally well tolerated. The majority of side effects observed\n  in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature and less than 3% of patients\n  discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects. From the original\n  premarketing studies, where both pediatric and adult patients were enrolled,\n  the most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%),\n  nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%).\n  The overall incidence of side effects, and in particular diarrhea, increased\n  with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported reactions include:\n  Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 US/Canadian clinical trial \n  was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided q12h) of AUGMENTIN for \n  10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided q8h) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days in the \n  treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and \n  only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse \n  event profile seen was comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences \n  in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. (See \n  Clinical Studies.) The following adverse reactions have been reported for ampicillin-class antibiotics: Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis,\n  stomatitis, glossitis, black “hairy” tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis,\n  enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous\n  colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema,\n  serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis,\n  arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme (rarely Stevens-Johnson\n  syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis,\n  and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal\n  necrolysis) have been reported. These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines \n  and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur,\n  the drug should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates\n  otherwise. Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions\n  can occur with oral penicillin. (See WARNINGS.) Liver: A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) has been noted\n  in patients treated with ampicillin-class antibiotics, but the significance\n  of these findings is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic\n  jaundice, (see CONTRAINDICATIONS), increases in serum transaminases (AST\n  and/or ALT), serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been infrequently\n  reported with AUGMENTIN. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly,\n  in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on\n  liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or\n  mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic\n  dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued.\n  The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. On rare\n  occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death reported per estimated\n  4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally been cases associated\n  with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. Renal:Interstitial nephritis and hematuria have been reported rarely. \n  Crystalluria has also been reported (see OVERDOSAGE). Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,\n  thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have\n  been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible\n  on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.\n  A slight thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with\n  AUGMENTIN. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients\n  receiving AUGMENTIN and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion,\n  convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported\n  rarely. Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining)\n  has been rarely reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration\n  was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.",

    "sideEffects": "Although some patients may\ntolerate full intravenous doses of amphotericin B without difficulty, most will\nexhibit some intolerance, often at less than the full therapeutic dose. Tolerance may be improved by\ntreatment with aspirin, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), antihistamines, or\n antiemetics. Meperidine (25 to 50 mg IV) has been shown in some patients to\ndecrease the duration of shaking chills and fever that may accompany the infusion\nof amphotericin B. Administration of amphotericin B\non alternate days may decrease anorexia and phlebitis. Intravenous administration of\nsmall doses of adrenal corticosteroids just prior to or during the amphotericin\nB infusion may help decrease febrile reactions. Dosage and duration of such\n corticosteroid therapy should be kept to a minimum (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG\nINTERACTIONS). Addition of heparin (1000 units\nper infusion), and the use of pediatric scalp-vein needle may lessen the\n incidence of thrombophlebitis. Extravasation may cause chemical\nirritation.

Cardiopulmonary: hypotension; tachypnea. Gastrointestinal: anorexia; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; dyspepsia; cramping epigastric pain. Hematologic: normochromic,\nnormocytic anemia. Local: pain\nat the injection site with or without phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. Musculoskeletal: generalized pain, including muscle and joint pains. Neurologic:headache. Renal: decreased\nrenal function and renal function abnormalities including: azotemia,\nhypokalemia, hyposthenuria, renal tubular acidosis; and nephrocalcinosis. These\nusually improve with interruption of therapy. However, some permanent\nimpairment often occurs, especially in those patients receiving large amounts\n(over 5 g) of amphotericin B or receiving other nephrotoxic agents. In some\npatients hydration and sodium repletion prior to amphotericin B administration\nmay reduce the risk of developing nephrotoxicity. Supplemental alkali medication\nmay decrease renal tubular acidosis. The following adverse reactions\nhave also been reported: General (body as a whole): flushing.

    "sideEffects": "As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillin and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal: glositis, stamatitis, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms of the drugs. Hypersensitivity Reactions: An erythematous, mildly pruritic, maculopapular skin rash has been reported fairly frequently. The rash, which usually does not develop within the first week of therapy, may cover the entire body including the soles, palms, and oral mucosa. The eruption usually disappears in three to seven days. Other hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported are: skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form of the drug Note: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled by antihistamines, and if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening, and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactoid reactions require emergency measures (see WARNINGS). Liver: Moderate elevation in serum glutamic oxalaacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukapenia, and agranulacytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Other: Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the use at ampicillin are laryngeal stride and high fever. An occasional patient may complain of sore mouth or tongue as with any oral penicillin preparation.",
    "warnings": "Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral administration, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history at penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been well documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with any penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Serious anaphylactoid reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, should also be administered as indicated.",
    "dosage": "The usual oral dose range of Principen for most infections is 250 to 500 mg 4 times daily for 7-14 days. To treat gonorrhea, a single 3.5 g dose is administered along with probenecid."

    "sideEffects": "Multisystem adverse reactions have been reported, and some may be serious enough to warrant hospital admission. In general, they may be divided into 2 categories: those which involve abnormal bleeding and other effects which do not. Hemorrhage and/or necrosis are among the hazards of treatment with any anticoagulant and are the main serious complications of therapy. For additional discussion of possible hemorrhagic complications following oral anticoagulant therapy see WARNINGS. Although most of the adverse reactions for oral anticoagulant drugs have been reported for warfarin, dicumarol, and phenindione, all the drugs within this class have similar pharmacologic and clinical properties, and require the same degree of caution in monitoring adverse reactions regardless of the drug administered. Some indanediones (phenindione)have been associated with undesirable reactions which have not been reported with the coumarins and are not counterbalanced by advantages, thus perhaps favoring the use of the coumarin-type anticoagulants. Changing from one chemical type of oral anticoagulant to the other may eliminate an adverse reaction, such as rash or diarrhea. Dermatitis is the only untoward reaction consistently associated with anisindione therapy. Adverse reactions reported following therapy with either coumarin or indanedione anticoagulants include:nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, dermatitis or exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, alopecia, and sore mouth or mouth ulcers. Side effects which have additionally been reported for coumarin derivatives include:vomit-ing, abdominal cramps, anorexia, priapism, ery-thema and necrosis of the skin and other tissues, manifesting as purple toes and cutaneous gangrene. There is no reason to expect that some or all of these adverse reactions might not occur in patients receiving anisindione. Additional side effects attributed to the indane-dione anticoagulants include: headache, sore throat, blurred vision, paralysis of accommodation, steatorrhea, hepatitis, jaundice, liver damage, renal tubular necrosis, albuminuria, anuria, myeloid immaturity, agranulocytosis, leukocyte agglutinins, red cell aplasia, atypical mononuclear cells, leukopenia, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombo-cytopenia, and eosinophilia.

Cardiovascular System Vasculitis. Digestive System Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea. Hemic and Lymphatic System Thrombocytopenia (see WARNINGS, Thrombocytopenia); \n  purpura; lymphadenopathy; leukocytosis. Immune System Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported as well as related\n  phenomena such as angioneurotic edema (including peripheral or facial edema)\n  and bronchial spasm in individuals with or without an allergic history.

Experience from more than 80 million doses of all live measles vaccines given\n  in the U.S. through 1975 indicates that significant central nervous system reactions\n  such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, occurring within 30 days after vaccination,\n  have been temporally associated with measles vaccine very rarely.28\n  In no case has it been shown that reactions were actually caused by vaccine.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pointed out that “a\n  certain number of cases of encephalitis may be expected to occur in a large\n  childhood population in a defined period of time even when no vaccines are administered”.29\n  However, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have\n  been caused by measles vaccines. The risk of such serious neurological disorders\n  following live measles virus vaccine administration remains far less than that\n  for encephalitis and encephalopathy with natural measles (one per two thousand\n  reported cases).30 Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 200 million doses of M-M-R and\n  M-M-R II that have been distributed worldwide over 25 years (1971-1996) indicates\n  that serious adverse events such as encephalitis and encephalopathy continue\n  to be rarely reported.10 There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children\n  who did not have a history of natural measles but did receive measles vaccine.\n  Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first\n  year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. Based on estimated nationwide\n  measles vaccine distribution, the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination\n  is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed. This is far less than\n  the association with natural measles, 6-22 cases of SSPE per million cases of\n  measles. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the\n  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of\n  measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with\n  its inherent higher risk of SSPE.31 Respiratory System Pneumonitis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS); cough; rhinitis.",

From the original\n  premarketing studies, where both pediatric and adult patients were enrolled,\n  the most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%),\n  nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%).\n  The overall incidence of side effects, and in particular diarrhea, increased\n  with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported reactions include:\n  Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 US/Canadian clinical trial \n  was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided q12h) of AUGMENTIN for \n  10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided q8h) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days in the \n  treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and \n  only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse \n  event profile seen was comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences \n  in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. (See \n  Clinical Studies.) The following adverse reactions have been reported for ampicillin-class antibiotics: Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis,\n  stomatitis, glossitis, black “hairy” tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis,\n  enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous\n  colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema,\n  serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis,\n  arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme (rarely Stevens-Johnson\n  syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis,\n  and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal\n  necrolysis) have been reported. These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines \n  and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur,\n  the drug should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates\n  otherwise. Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions\n  can occur with oral penicillin. (See WARNINGS.) Liver: A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) has been noted\n  in patients treated with ampicillin-class antibiotics, but the significance\n  of these findings is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic\n  jaundice, (see CONTRAINDICATIONS), increases in serum transaminases (AST\n  and/or ALT), serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been infrequently\n  reported with AUGMENTIN. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly,\n  in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on\n  liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or\n  mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic\n  dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued.\n  The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. On rare\n  occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death reported per estimated\n  4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally been cases associated\n  with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. Renal:Interstitial nephritis and hematuria have been reported rarely. \n  Crystalluria has also been reported (see OVERDOSAGE). Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,\n  thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have\n  been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible\n  on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.\n  A slight thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with\n  AUGMENTIN. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients\n  receiving AUGMENTIN and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion,\n  convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported\n  rarely. Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining)\n  has been rarely reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration\n  was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.",
