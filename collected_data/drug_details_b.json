    "sideEffects": "Symptoms of bladder irritability, related to the\n inflammatory response induced, are reported in approximately 60% of patients\nreceiving TICE® BCG. The symptoms typically begin 4–6 hours after instillation\nand last 24–72 hours. The irritative side effects are usually seen following\nthe third instillation, and tend to increase in severity after each\nadministration. The irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be\nmanaged symptomatically with products such as pyridium, propantheline bromide,\noxybutynin chloride and acetaminophen. The mechanism of action of the\nirritative side effects has not been firmly established, but is most consistent\nwith an immunological mechanism.3 There is no evidence that dose\nreduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative\ntoxicity of TICE® BCG. “Flu-like” symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which\nmay accompany the localized, irritative toxicities often reflect\nhypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. Antihistamines \nhave also been used.5 Adverse reactions to TICE® BCG tend to be progressive in\nfrequency and severity with subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of\nsubsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during\nsubsequent instillation. Although uncommon, serious infectious complications of\nintravesical BCG have been reported.2,3,6 The most serious\ninfectious complication of BCG is disseminated sepsis with associated\nmortality. In addition, M. bovis infections have been reported in lung,\nliver, bone, bone marrow, kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in\npatients who have received intravesical BCG. Some male genitourinary tract\ninfections (orchitis/epididymitis) have been resistant to multiple drug\nantituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy. If a patient develops persistent fever or experiences\nan acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment should be\ndiscontinued and the patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic\ninfection (see WARNINGS).

    "warnings": "Benzyl alcohol, a preservative in Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP has been associated with toxicity in neonates. Data are unavailable on the toxicity of other preservatives in this age group. Where water is required for preparing or diluting medications for use in neonates, only preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection should be used.",
    "dosage": "Bacteriostatic Water for Injection is supplied in a multiple-dose 30 mL plastic fliptop vial that is plastic and not pressurized. It is not used for neonatal medications because of possible blood pressure changes and toxicity of benzyl alcohol.

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. The incidence of adverse events for Simulect® (basiliximab) was determined in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection. Two of the studies (Study 1 and Study 2), used a dual maintenance immunosuppressive regimen comprised of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids, whereas the other two studies (Study 3 and Study 4) used a triple-immunosuppressive regimen comprised of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED), corticosteroids, and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Simulect did not appear to add to the background of adverse events seen in organ transplantation patients as a consequence of their underlying disease and the concurrent administration of immunosuppressants and other medications. Adverse events were reported by 96% of the patients in the placebo-treated group and 96% of the patients in the Simulect-treated group. In the four placebo-controlled studies, the pattern of adverse events in 590 patients treated with the recommended dose of Simulect was similar to that in 594 patients treated with placebo. Simulect did not increase the incidence of serious adverse events observed compared with placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, reported in 69% of Simulect-treated patients and 67% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in Simulect-treated and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse events occurred in ≥ 10% of Simulect-treated patients: Gastrointestinal System: constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Body as a Whole-General: pain, peripheral edema, fever, viral infection; Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia; Urinary System: urinary tract infection; Respiratory System: dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection; Skin and Appendages: surgical wound complications, acne; Cardiovascular Disorders-General: hypertension; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: headache, tremor; Psychiatric: insomnia; Red Blood Cell: anemia. The following adverse events, not mentioned above, were reported with an incidence of ≥ 3% and < 10% in pooled analysis of patients treated with Simulect in the four controlled clinical trials, or in an analysis of the two dual-therapy trials: Body as a Whole-General: accidental trauma, asthenia, chest pain, increased drug level, infection, face edema, fatigue, dependent edema, generalized edema, leg edema, malaise, rigors, sepsis; Cardiovascular: abnormal heart sounds, aggravated hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac failure, chest pain, hypotension; Endocrine: increased glucocorticoids; Gastrointestinal: enlarged abdomen, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, gum hyperplasia, melena, moniliasis, ulcerative stomatitis;",

The adverse reactions seen in at least 2% of bepridil patients in controlled trials are shown in the following table.",
    "warnings": "Induction of New Serious Arrhythmias  \nVASCOR (bepridil hydrochloride) has Class 1 anti-arrhythmic properties and, like other such drugs, can induce new arrhythmias, including VT/VF. In addition, because of its ability to prolong the QT interval, VASCOR (bepridil)  can cause torsades de pointes type ventricular tachycardia. Because of these properties VASCOR (bepridil)  should be reserved for patients in whom other anti-anginal agents do not offer a satisfactory effect.  \nIn US clinical trials, the QT and QTc intervals were commonly prolonged by VASCOR (bepridil)  in a dose-related fashion. While the mean prolongation of QTc was 8% and of QT was 10%. Increases of 25% or more were not uncommon, occurring in 5% of the studied population for QTc and 8.7% of the studied population for QT. Increased QT and QTc may be associated with torsades de pointes type VT, which was seen at least briefly, in about 1.0% of patients in US trials; in many cases, however, patients with marked prolongation of QTc were taken off VASCOR (bepridil)  therapy. All of the US patients with torsades de pointes had a prolonged QT interval and relatively low serum potassium. French marketing experience has reported over one hundred verified cases of torsades de pointes. While this number, based on total use, represents a rate of only 0.01%, the true rate is undoubtedly much higher, as spontaneous reporting systems all suffer from substantial under reporting.  \nTorsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often but not always associated with a prolonged QT interval, and often drug induced. The relation between the degree of QT prolongation and the development of torsades de pointes is not linear and the likelihood of torsades appears to be increased by hypokalemia, use of potassium wasting diuretics, and the presence of antecedent bradycardia. While the safe upper limit of QT is not defined, it is suggested that the interval not be permitted to exceed 0.52 seconds during treatment. If dose reduction does not eliminate the excessive prolongation, VASCOR (bepridil)  should be stopped.  \nBecause most domestic and foreign cases of torsades have developed in patients with hypokalemia, usually related to diuretic use or significant liver disease, if concomitant diuretics are needed, low doses and addition or primary use of a potassium sparing diuretic should be considered and serum potassium should be monitored.  \nVASCOR (bepridil)  has been associated with the usual range of pro-arrhythmic effects characteristic of Class 1 anti-arrhythmics (increased premature ventricular contraction rates, new sustained VT, and VT/VF that is more resistant to sinus rhythm conversion). Use in patients with severe arrhythmias (who are most susceptible to certain pro-arrhythmic effects) has been limited, so that risk in these patients is not defined.  \nIn the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long-term, multi-centered, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had myocardial infarctions more than six days but less than two years previously, an excess mortality/non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in patients treated with encainide or flecainide (56/730) compared with that seen in patients assigned to matched placebo-treated groups (22/725). The applicability of these results to other populations (e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) or to other anti-arrhythmic drugs is uncertain, but at present it is prudent to consider any drug documented to provoke new serious arrhythmias or worsening of pre-existing arrhythmias as having a similar risk and to avoid their use in the post-infarction period.",

    "sideEffects": "Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient and are typical of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, eg, bradycardia, fatigue, dyspnea, and lethargy. Withdrawal of therapy in U.S. and European controlled clinical trials has been necessary in about 3.5% of patients, principally because of bradycardia, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and impotence. Frequency estimates of adverse events were derived from controlled studies in which adverse reactions were volunteered and elicited in U.S studies and volunteered and/or elicited in European studies. In the U.S., the placebo-controlled hypertension studies lasted for 4 weeks, while the active-controlled hypertension studies had a 22- to 24- week double-blind phase. The following doses were studied: betaxolol-5, 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily; atenolol-25, 50, and 100 mg once daily; and propranolol-40, 80, and 160 mg b.i.d. Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride) , like other beta-blockers, has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (e.g., lupus erythematosus). In controlled clinical studies, conversion of ANA from negative to positive occurred in 5.3% of the patients treated with betaxolol, 6.3% of the patients treated with atenolol, 4.9% of the patients treated with propranolol, and 3.2% of the patients treated with placebo. Betaxolol adverse events reported with a 2% or greater frequency, and selected events with lower frequency, in U.S. controlled studies are:",

    "sideEffects": "Burning and/or stinging of short duration at the injection site have been reported. The adverse clinical reactions associated with the use of BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II are those expected to follow administration of the monovalent vaccines given separately. These may include malaise, sore throat, cough, rhinitis, headache, dizziness, fever, rash, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; mild local reactions such as erythema, induration, tenderness and regional lymphadenopathy; parotitis, orchitis, nerve deafness, thrombocytopenia and purpura; allergic reactions such as wheal and flare at the injection site or urticaria; polyneuritis; and arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic). Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Vasculitis has been reported rarely. Moderate fever [101-102.9°F (38.3-39.4°C)] occurs occasionally, and high fever [above 103°F (39.4°C)] occurs less commonly. On rare occasions, children developing fever may exhibit febrile convulsions. Syncope, particularly at the time of mass vaccination, has been reported. Rash occurs infrequently and is usually minimal, but rarely may be generalized. Erythema multiforme has also been reported rarely. Forms of optic neuritis, including retrobulbar neuritis and papillitis may infrequently follow viral infections, and have been reported to occur 1 to 3 weeks following inoculation with some live virus vaccines. Isolated reports of polyneuropathy including Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported after immunization with rubella-containing vaccines. Clinical experience with live attenuated rubella and mumps virus vaccines given individually indicates that encephalitis and other nervous system reactions have occurred very rarely. These might occur also with BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II. Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of natural rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. This type of involvement as well as myalgia and paresthesia have also been reported following administration of MERUVAX II (Rubella Virus Vaccine Live). Chronic arthritis has been associated with natural rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon and generally of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (children: 0-3%; women: 12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and in adult women. Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.",

A total of 273\npatients were treated with 5-20 mg of bisoprolol fumarate; 132 received placebo. Withdrawal of therapy for adverse events was 3.3% for patients receiving bisoprolol fumarate and\n6.8% for patients on placebo. Withdrawals were less than 1% for either bradycardia or fatigue/lack of\nenergy. The following table presents adverse experiences, whether or not considered drug related, reported in\nat least 1% of patients in these studies, for all patients studied in placebo-controlled clinical trials (2.5-\n40 mg), as well as for a subgroup that was treated with doses within the recommended dosage range (5-\n20 mg).

Adverse reactions to SENSORCAINE/ SENSORCAINE WITH EPINEPHRINE are characteristic of those associated with other amide-type local anesthetics. A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma levels, which may be due to overdosage, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. The most commonly encountered acute adverse reactions that demand immediate counter-measures were related to the CNS and the cardiovascular system. These adverse reactions were generally dose-related and due to high plasma levels which may have resulted from overdosage, rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance, or from unintentional intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related toxicity, unintentional intrathecal injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and neck region) has resulted in underventilation or apnea (“Total or High Spinal”). Also, hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or underventilation due to cephalad extension of the motor level of anesthesia have occurred.
