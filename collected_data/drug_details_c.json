    "sideEffects": "Since Rocaltrol is believed to be the active hormone which exerts vitamin D activity in the body, adverse effects are, in general, similar to those encountered with excessive vitamin D intake, i.e., hypercalcemia syndrome or calcium intoxication, depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcemia (see WARNINGS). Because of the short biological half-life of calcitriol, pharmacokinetic investigations have shown normalization of elevated serum calcium within a few days of treatment withdrawal, i.e., much faster than in treatment with vitamin D3 preparations. The early and late signs and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication associated with hypercalcemia include: Early: weakness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, muscle pain, bone pain, metallic taste, and anorexia, abdominal pain or stomach ache. Late: polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated BUN, albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT), ectopic calcification, nephrocalcinosis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, dystrophy, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and, rarely, overt psychosis. In clinical studies on hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypercalcemia was noted on at least one occasion in about 1 in 3 patients and hypercalciuria in about 1 in 7 patients. Elevated serum creatinine levels were observed in about 1 in 6 patients (approximately one half of whom had normal levels at baseline). In concurrent hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, soft-tissue calcification may occur; this can be seen radiographically (see WARNINGS). In patients with normal renal function, chronic hypercalcemia may be associated with an increase in serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and very rarely severe erythematous skin disorders) may occur in susceptible individuals. One case of erythema multiforme and one case of allergic reaction (swelling of lips and hives all over the body) were confirmed by rechallenge.

Reactions involving necrosis and ulceration have not been observed, but such reactions are theoretically possible and might occur in persons with exquisite cellular hypersensitivity to the antigen. Local reactions may be treated with a cold compress and topical steroids. Severe local reactions may require additional measures as appropriate. In a published study of 479 HIV positive adults tested with CANDIN, adverse local reactions were observed in six subjects as follows: pruritus (three), swelling at the test site (one), vesiculation (one) and vesiculation with weeping edema (one). Pruritus and swelling cleared within 48 hours; vesiculation with edema required approximately 1 week to resolve6 In two studies involving 171 persons discussed under CLINICAL STUDIES in Tables 1, 2, 3, and text, one adverse reaction was observed. This reaction consisted of induration 22 x 55 mm at 48 hours which resolved within 1 week8.

In 58 subjects tested to-date, there have been no cases of Type 1 allergy manifested as either generalized or adverse local reactions. One subject had induration with a central vesicle which subsided within a few days8. Severe local reactions, including rash, vesiculation, bullae, dermal exfoliation and cellulitis, have been reported to MedWatch for unstandardized allergenic extracts of Candida albicans used for anergy testing Systemic reactions to CANDIN have not been observed. However, all foreign antigens have the remote possibility of causing Type 1 anaphylaxis (7) and even death when injected intradermally. Systemic reactions usually occur within 30 minutes after the injection of antigen and may include the following symptoms: sneezing, coughing, itching, shortness of breath, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and respiratory failure in severe cases. Systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis must be immediately treated with Epinephrine HCL 1:1,000. Additional measures may be required, depending upon the severity of the reaction. Immediate Hypersensitivity reactions to CANDIN occur in some individuals. These reactions are characterized by the presence of an edematous hive surrounded by a zone of erythema.

Pruritus, urticaria, and positive Coombs' tests each occur in less than 1 in 200 patients. Cases of serum-sickness-like reactions have been reported with the use of cefaclor. These are characterized by findings of erythema multiforme, rashes, and other skin manifestations accompanied by arthritis/arthralgia, with or without fever, and differ from classic serum sickness in that there is infrequently associated lymphadenopathy and proteinuria, no circulating immune complexes, and no evidence to date of sequelae of the reaction. Occasionally, solitary symptoms may occur, but do not represent a serum-sickness-like reaction. While further investigation is ongoing, serum-sicknesslike reactions appear to be due to hypersensitivity and more often occur during or following a second (or subsequent) course of therapy with cefaclor. Such reactions have been reported more frequently in pediatric patients than in adults with an overall occurrence ranging from 1 in 200 (0.5%) in one focused trial to 2 in 8,346 (0.024%) in overall clinical trials (with an incidence in pediatric patients in clinical trials of 0.055%) to 1 in 38,000 (0.003%) in spontaneous event reports. Signs and symptoms usually occur a few days after initiation of therapy and subside within a few days after cessation of therapy; occasionally these reactions have resulted in hospitalization, usually of short duration (median hospitalization = 2 to 3 days, based on postmarketing surveillance studies). In those requiring hospitalization, the symptoms have ranged from mild to severe at the time of admission with more of the severe reactions occurring in pediatric patients. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids appear to enhance resolution of the signs and symptoms. No serious sequelae have been reported. More severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely. Anaphylactoid events may be manifested by solitary symptoms, including angioedema, asthenia, edema (including face and limbs), dyspnea, paresthesias, syncope, hypotension, or vasodilatation. Anaphylaxis may be more common in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Rarely, hypersensitivity symptoms may persist for several months. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in about 2.5% of patients and include diarrhea (1 in 70). Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (see WARNINGS). Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. As with some penicillins and some other cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely.

Gastrointestinal Some patients experience gastric irritation and occasionally nausea and vomiting, flatulence, diarrhea, and unpleasant taste occur. Miscellaneous Rarely, headache, hangover, idiosyncratic syndrome, and ketonuria have been reported. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Drug Enforcement Administration Schedule IV. Abuse Chloral hydrate may be habit- forming. Patients known to be addiction- prone and patients who actively solicit hypnotics in increasing doses are potential addicts. Many patients take higher doses of hypnotics than they admit, and slurring of speech, incoordination, tremulousness, and nystagmus should arouse suspicion. Drowsiness, lethargy, and hangover are frequently observed from excessive drug intake. Dependence Prolonged use of larger than usual therapeutic doses may result in psychic and physical dependence. Tolerance and psychologic dependence may develop by the second week of continued administration. Chloral hydrate addicts may take huge doses of the drug (i.e., up to 12 g nightly has been reported). This abuse is similar to alcohol addiction and sudden withdrawal may result in central nervous excitation, with tremor, anxiety, hallucination, or even delirium which may be fatal. In patients suffering from chronic chloral hydrate intoxication, gastritis is common and skin eruptions may develop. Parenchymatous renal injury may also occur. Withdrawal should be undertaken in a hospital and supportive treatment similar to that used during barbiturate withdrawal is recommended.",

Upon withdrawal of chloral hydrate, the rate of metabolism of the anticoagulant drug may decrease with a concomitant rise in plasma levels and with the possibility of a gradual increase of anticoagulant effects (i.e., development of bleeding tendency and hemorrhage).

The brand name Thorazine is discontinued in the U.S. Generic forms may be available.",
    "sideEffects": "Note: Some adverse effects of Thorazine (chlorpromazine)  may be more likely to occur, or occur \n  with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g., patients \n  with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension \n  following recommended doses. Drowsiness, usually mild to moderate, may occur, particularly during \n  the first or second week, after which it generally disappears. If troublesome, \n  dosage may be lowered. B Overall incidence has been low, regardless of indication or dosage. Most \n  investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between \n  the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious \n  hepatitis, with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice, rather than those \n  of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the \n  medication; however, chronic jaundice has been reported. There is no conclusive evidence that preexisting liver disease makes patients \n  more susceptible to jaundice. Alcoholics with cirrhosis have been successfully \n  treated with Thorazine (chlorpromazine) without complications. Nevertheless, \n  the medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Patients \n  who have experienced jaundice with a phenothiazine should not, if possible, \n  be reexposed to Thorazine (chlorpromazine)  or other phenothiazines. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should \n  be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment. Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic \n  obstruction; withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction \n  is confirmed. Hematological Disorders, including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, \n  hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia \n  have been reported. Agranulocytosis — Warn patients to report the sudden appearance \n  of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential \n  counts indicate cellular depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and \n  other suitable therapy. Most cases have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy; patients \n  should be watched closely during that period. Moderate suppression of white blood cells is not an indication for stopping \n  treatment unless accompanied by the symptoms described above.",

Fever and infections have also been reported in patients with \n  neutropenia. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression (see \n  PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use). In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin (cisplatin injection)  hemolytic anemia, a further course of treatment may be accompanied by increased hemolysis and this risk should be weighed by the treating physician. The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of cisplatin (cisplatin injection)  has rarely been reported in humans. In these reports, cisplatin (cisplatin injection)  was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.

    "sideEffects": "Adverse reactions to injectable contrast media fall into two categories: chemotoxic reactions and idiosyncratic reactions. Chemotoxic reactions result from the physio-chemical properties of the contrast media, the dose and speed of injection. All hemodynamic disturbances and injuries to organs or vessels perfused by the contrast medium are included in this category. Idiosyncratic reactions include all other reactions. They occur more frequently in patients 20 to 40 years old. Idiosyncratic reactions may or may not be dependent on the amount of dose injected, the speed of injection, the mode of injection and the radiographic procedure. Idiosyncratic reactions are subdivided into minor, intermediate and severe. The minor reactions are self-limited and of short duration; the severe reactions are life-threatening and treatment is urgent and mandatory. Fatalities have been reported following the administration of iodine-containing contrast agents. Based upon clinical literature, the incidence of death is reported to range from one in 10,000 (0.01 percent) to less than one in 100,000 (0.001 percent). The following adverse reactions have been observed in conjunction with the use of iodine-containing contrast agents. The most frequent adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, facial flush and a feeling of body warmth. These are usually of brief duration. Other reactions include the following:",

    "warnings": "Do not use CORTAID (hydrocortisone cream and ointment 1.0%)  near the eyes if you have glaucoma. Treatment with alclometasone, clobetasol, halobetasol propionate and augmented betamethasone dipropionate beyond two weeks consecutively is not recommended. Do not use if there is an infection or sores present on the area to be treated. Though very unlikely, it is possible CORTAID (hydrocortisone cream and ointment 1.0%)  will be absorbed into your bloodstream. This may have undesirable consequences that may require additional corticosteroid treatment. This is especially true for children and for those who have used this for an extended period if they also have serious medical problems such as serious infections, injuries or surgeries. This precaution applies for up to one year after stopping use of this drug. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details. CORTAID (hydrocortisone cream and ointment 1.0%)  should be used cautiously during pregnancy and only if clearly needed. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor.

Subjects have also reported an urge to take a deep breath, which occurs with a timing similar to, but less frequently than, that of flushing. Higher doses (>3 mcg/kg) are associated with more prolonged flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, and \"chest compression\" or tightness. In addition, at doses of >5 mcg/kg, significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure were observed. The cardiovascular effects occurred 2-3 minutes after injection and lasted for 30-60 minutes. The facial flushing was more prolonged, lasting up to 4 hours in some subjects. All signs and symptoms could be reduced by administering the drug as a 30-second infusion instead of by bolus injection. Total doses of up to 200 mcg of corticorelin were administered as a bolus injection to 60 men and women, including both healthy normal subjects and patients with endocrine disorders. In most cases, only minor adverse effects, such as transient flushing and feelings of dyspnea, were noted. However, a few patients with disorders of the pituitary-adrenal axis had major symptoms. One patient had a precipitous fall in blood pressure and pulse rate and developed asystole, which required resuscitation. In two patients with Cushing's disease and in one with secondary adrenal insufficiency, an \"absence-like\" loss of consciousness occurred, which started within a few seconds after injection of corticorelin and lasted from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. This was accompanied by a slight fall in blood pressure. One patient with a well documented seizure diathesis experienced a grand mal epileptic seizure following ACTHREL® administration.

In a study of 35 pediatric patients treated with fluticasone propionate ointment\n  0.005% for atopic dermatitis over at least 35% of body surface area, subnormal\n  adrenal function was observed with cosyntropin stimulation testing at the end\n  of 3 to 4 weeks of treatment in 4 patients who had normal testing prior to treatment.\n  It is not known if these patients had recovery of adrenal function because follow-up\n  testing was not performed (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric\n  Use, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Telangiectasia\n  on the face was noted in one patient on the eighth day of a four week treatment\n  period. Facial use was discontinued and the telangiectasia resolved. The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently\n  with topical corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, and they may\n  occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency\n  corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order\n  of occurrence: dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation,\n  perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin\n  atrophy, striae, and miliaria.

    "sideEffects": "The following are adverse reactions in decreasing order of severity within each category associated with CYLERT (pemoline) : Hepatic: There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction, ranging from asymptomatic reversible increases in liver enzymes to hepatitis, jaundice and life- threatening hepatic failure, in patients taking CYLERT (see PRECAUTIONS and WARNINGS). Hematopoietic: There have been isolated reports of aplastic anemia. Central Nervous System: The following CNS effects have been reported with the use of CYLERT (pemoline) : convulsive seizures: literature reports indicate that CYLERT (pemoline)  may precipitate attacks of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; hallucinations; dyskinetic movements of the tongue, lips, face and extremities: abnorrnal oculomotor function including nystagmus and oculogyric crisis; mild depression; dizziness; increased irritability; headache; and drowsiness. Insomnia is the most frequently reported side effect of CYLERT (pemoline) , it usually occurs early in therapy prior to an optimum therapeutic response. In the majority of cases it is transient in nature or responds to a reduction in dosage. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia and weight loss may occur during the first weeks of therapy. In the majority of cases it is transient in nature; weight gain usually resumes within three to six months. Nausea and stomach ache have also been reported. Genitourinary: A case of elevated acid phosphatase in association with prostatic enlargement has been reported in a 63 year old male who was treated with CYLERT (pemoline)  for sleepiness. The acid phosphatase normalized with discontinuation of CYLERT (pemoline)  and was again elevated with rechallenge. Miscellaneous: Suppression of growth has been reported with the long- term use of stimulants in children. (See WARNINGS.) Skin rash has been reported with CYLERT (pemoline) . Mild adverse reactions appearing early during the course of treatment with CYLERT (pemoline)  often remit with continuing therapy. If adverse reactions are of a significant or protracted nature, dosage should be reduced or the drug discontinued.",
    "warnings": "Because of its association with life threatening hepatic failure, CYLERT (pemoline)  should not ordinarily be considered as first line drug therapy for ADHD (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).\nSince CYLERT (pemoline) 's marketing in 1975, 13 cases of acute hepatic failure have been reported to the FDA. While the absolute number of reported cases is not large. the rate of reporting ranges from 4 to 17 times the rate expected in the general population. This estimate may be conservative because of under reporting and because the long latency between initiation of CYLERT (pemoline)  treatment and the occurrence of hepatic failure may limit recognition of the association. If only a por-tion of actual cases were recognized and reported, the risk could be substantially higher.  \nOf the 13 cases reported as of May 1996, 11 resulted in death or liver transplantation, usually within four weeks of the onset of signs and symptoms of liver failure. The ear-liest onset of hepatic abnormalities occurred six months after initiation of CYLERT (pemoline) . Although some reports described dark urine and nonspecific prodromal symptoms (e.g., anorexia, malaise, and gastrointestinal symp-toms), in other reports it was not clear if any prodromal symptoms preceded the onset of jaundice. It is also not clear if the recom-mended baseline and periodic liver function testing are predictive of these instances of acute liver failure. CYLERT (pemoline)  should be dis-continued if clinically significant hepatic dysfunction is observed during its use (see PRECAUTIONS).",
    "dosage": "The recommended starting dose of pemoline is 37.5 mg/day, taken as a single dose once each morning. The effective daily dose for most patients ranges from 56.25 to 75 mg. The maximum recommended daily dose of pemoline is 112.5 mg."

Cytogam may be available in generic form.",
    "sideEffects": "Minor reactions such as flushing, chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and wheezing were the most frequent adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of CytoGam®, Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human). The incidence of these reactions during the clinical trials was less than 6.0% of all infusions and such reactions were most often related to infusion rates. A decrease in blood pressure was observed in 1 of 1039 infusions in clinical trials of CytoGam®. If a patient develops a minor side effect, slow the rate immediately or temporarily interrupt the infusion. Increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been observed as soon as one to two days following IGIV infusion. Progression to oliguria or anuria requiring dialysis has been observed. Types of severe renal adverse events that have been seen following IGIV therapy include acute renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy and osmotic nephrosis (18-25). Severe reactions such as angioneurotic edema and anaphylactic shock, although not observed during clinical trials, are a possibility. Clinical anaphylaxis may occur even when the patient is not known to be sensitized to immune globulin products. A reaction may be related to the rate of infusion; therefore, carefully adhere to the infusion rates as outlined under “DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.” If anaphylaxis or drop in blood pressure occurs, discontinue infusion and use antidote such as diphenhydramine and adrenalin.",

The risk of transmission of recognized blood-borne viruses is considered to be low because of the viral inactivation and removal properties in the Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol precipitation procedure used for purification of immune globulin products (13-15). Until 1993, cold ethanol manufactured immune globulins licensed in the United States had not been documented to transmit any viral agent. However, during a brief period in late 1993 to early 1994, intravenous immune globulin made by one U.S. manufacturer was associated with transmission of Hepatitis C virus (16). To further guard against possible transmission of blood- borne viruses, including Hepatitis C, CMV-IGIV is treated with a solvent detergent viral inactivation procedure (2) known to inactivate a wide spectrum of lipid enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C (17).

However, as with any alkalinizing agent, caution must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of hyperkalemia or alkalosis. Potassium intoxication causes listlessness, weakness, mental confusion, tingling of extremities, and other symptoms associated with a high concentration of potassium in the serum. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes should be carried out in those patients with renal disease in order to avoid these complications. Hyperkalemia may exhibit the following electrocardiographic abnormalities: Disappearance of the P wave, widening and slurring of QRS complex, changes of the S-T segment, tall peaked T waves, etc.",
