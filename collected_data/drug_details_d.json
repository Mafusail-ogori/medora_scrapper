Rates observed in clinical studies may not reflect those observed in clinical practice. Adverse reaction information obtained in clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating the rate of occurrence. The safety of ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  was determined in four clinical studies of renal allograft rejection, three of which were randomized controlled clinical trials, in 629 patients receiving renal allografts of whom 336 received ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  and 293 received placebo. All patients received concomitant cyclosporine and corticosteroids. In these clinical trials, ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  did not appear to alter the pattern, frequency or severity of known major toxicities associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs. The use of ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  was associated with a higher incidence of mortality when \n  compared to placebo in a large (n=434) randomized controlled study of patients \n  receiving cardiac transplants (see WARNINGS and \n  Incidence of Infectious Episodes). Adverse events were reported by 95% of the patients in the placebo-treated group and 96% of the patients in the group treated with ZENAPAX (daclizumab) . The proportion of patients prematurely withdrawn from the combined studies because of adverse events was 8.5% in the placebo-treated group and 8.6% in the group treated with ZENAPAX (daclizumab) . ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  did not increase the number of serious adverse events observed compared with placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, which were reported with equal frequency in ZENAPAX (daclizumab) - (67%) and placebo-treated (68%) patient groups. The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in both placebo-treated\n  patients and patients treated with ZENAPAX (daclizumab) .

DDAVP is \n    a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication \n    and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can \n    be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed \n    with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required.\n   When DDAVP is administered, in particular, in pediatric and geriatric patients, \n    fluid intake should be adjusted downward in order to decrease the potential \n    occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia (See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric \n    Use and Geriatric Use.) All patients receiving DDAVP therapy should be \n    observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia: \n    headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium weight gain, restlessness, \n    fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, \n    muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as \n    hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may \n    include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory \n    arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare \n    occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in \n    seizures which could lead to coma.\n   DDAVP should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic \n    polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting \n    them at greater risk of hyponatremia.",

Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions\nmay occur. Severe reactions may cause shock and loss of consciousness. Fatalities have occurred\nrarely11 . Systemic reactions occur with varying frequency in different clinics. To some extent, the\nreaction rate is related to the type and dose of administered extract and to the degree of sensitivity of\nthe patient. Despite all precautions, occasional reactions are unavoidable. Reports from regulatory\nauthorities in Sweden to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) indicated that\nseveral deaths have been associated with the use of mite extracts. CBER was subsequently informed\nthat these deaths may have been related to use by physicians or other health professionals untrained in\nthe administration of potent allergens, rather than a product defect. It should be noted that anaphylaxis\nand deaths following the injection of mite and other extracts also have been reported by the British\nCommittee on Safety in Medicine in the British Medical Journal, 293: 943, 1986. Local reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling, tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at\nthe injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several\ndays. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and\nprolonged local reactions, steroids may be helpful. The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is somewhat dependent upon the symptom complex.\nEpinephrine hydrochloride 1:1,000 aqueous, in an adult dose of 0.3 - 0.5 mL (or 0.01 mL per kg. for\nchildren) administered subcutaneously in the opposite arm is the immediate treatment of choice. A\ntourniquet should be placed above the site of the extract injection if the injection was done on the\nextremities. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Persistent wheezing may necessitate intravenous aminophylline treatment. For\nprofound shock and hypotension, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and oxygen also may be needed. Maintenance of an open airway is critical if upper airway obstruction is present. Corticosteroids may\nprovide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent.",

The data described below reflect exposure to DETROL 2 mg\nbid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five\nPhase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted\nunder widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the\nclinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical\ntrials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse\nreaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for\nidentifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and\napproximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving DETROL 2 mg bid\nreported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse\nevents reported by patients receiving DETROL were dry mouth, headache, constipation,\nvertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision\n(accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are\nexpected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event\nfor patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies,\noccurring in 34.8% of patients treated with DETROL and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients.\nOne percent of patients treated with DETROL discontinued treatment due to dry\nmouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events\nwas highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients\ntreated with DETROL 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events\nversus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to\ndiscontinuation of DETROL were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid\nreported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG\nchanges in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients\ntreated with DETROL 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1%\nor more of the patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies.\nThe adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

    "sideEffects": "Adverse reactions to injectable contrast media fall into\ntwo categories: chemotoxic reactions and idiosyncratic reactions. Chemotoxic reactions result from the physio-chemical\nproperties of the contrast media, the dose, and speed of injection. All\nhemodynamic disturbances and injuries to organs or vessels perfused by the\ncontrast medium are included in this category. Idiosyncratic reactions include all other reactions. They\noccur more frequently in patients 20 to 40 years old. Idiosyncratic reactions\nmay or may not be dependent on the amount of dose injected, the speed of\ninjection, the mode of injection and the radiographic procedure. Idiosyncratic\nreactions are subdivided into minor, intermediate and severe. The minor\nreactions are self-limited and of short duration; the severe reactions are\nlife-threatening and treatment is urgent and mandatory. Fatalities have been reported following the\nadministration of iodine-containing contrast agents. Based upon clinical\nliterature, the incidence of death is reported to range from one in 10,000\n(0.01 percent) to less than one in 100,000 (0.001 percent). Nausea, vomiting, flushing, or a generalized feeling of\nwarmth are the reactions seen most frequently with intravascular injection.\nSymptoms which may occur include chills, fever, sweating, headache, dizziness,\npallor, weakness, severe retching and choking, wheezing, a rise or fall in\nblood pressure, facial or conjunctival petechiae, urticaria, pruritus, rash and\nother eruptions, edema, cramps, tremors, itching, sneezing and lacrimation.\nAntihistaminic agents may be of benefit; rarely, such reactions may be severe\nenough to require discontinuation of dosage. Although venous tolerance is usually good, there have\nbeen reports of a burning or stinging sensation or numbness, venospasm or\nvenous pain, and partial collapse of the injected vein. Neutropenia or\n thrombophlebitis may occur. Tissue necrosis has occurred with extravasation. Severe reactions which may require emergency measures may\ntake the form of a cardiovascular reaction characterized by peripheral\nvasodilatation with resultant hypotension and reflex tachycardia, dyspnea,\nagitation, confusion, convulsions, and cyanosis progressing to unconsciousness.\nOr, the histamine-liberating effect of these compounds may induce an\nallergic-like reaction, which may range in severity from rhinitis or\nangioneurotic edema to laryngeal or bronchial spasm or anaphylactoid shock.\nExtremely rare cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in\ndeath have been reported. Temporary renal shutdown or other nephropathy may occur. Thyroid function tests indicative of hypothyroidism or\ntransient thyroid suppression have been uncommonly reported following iodinated\ncontrast media administration to adult and pediatric patients, including\ninfants. Some patients were treated for hypothyroidism. In addition to the adverse reactions described above,\nadverse reactions may sometimes occur as a consequence of the procedure for which\nthe contrast agent is used. Adverse reactions in excretion urography\nhave included cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, anaphylaxis with severe\n asthmatic reaction, and flushing due to generalized vasodilation. In aortography,\nthe risks of procedures include injury to the aorta and neighboring organs,\n pleural puncture, renal damage including infarction and acute tubular necrosis \nwith oliguria and anuria, accidental selective filling of the right renal\nartery during the translumbar procedure in the presence of pre-existent renal\ndisease, retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the translumbar approach, spinal cord \ninjury and pathology associated with the syndrome of transverse myelitis,\ngeneralized petechiae, and death following hypotension, arrhythmia, and anaphylactoid\nreactions. Adverse reactions in pediatric angiocardiography have\nincluded arrhythmia and death. During peripheral arteriography,\ncomplications have occurred including hemorrhage from the puncture site,\n thrombosis of the vessel, and brachial plexus palsy following axillary artery\ninjections. During selective coronary arteriography with or without left\nventriculography, most patients will have transient ECG changes. Transient\narrhythmias may occur infrequently. Ventricular fibrillation may result from\nmanipulation of the catheter during the procedure or administration of the\nmedium. Other reactions may include hypotension, chest pain, and myocardial\ninfarction. Fatalities have been reported. Complications due to the procedure\ninclude hemorrhage, thrombosis, pseudoaneurysms at the puncture site, and\ndislodgment of arteriosclerotic plaques. Dissection of the coronary vessels and\ntransient sinus arrest have occurred rarely. Adverse reactions in selective renal arteriography\ninclude nausea, vomiting, hypotension and hypertension.",

DIFLUCAN has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of DIFLUCAN-associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. DIFLUCAN hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy.

Fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with serious underlying diseases. Patients with deep seated fungal infections who develop rashes during treatment with DIFLUCAN should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress. Fluconazole should be discontinued in patients treated for superficial fungal infection who develop a rash that may be attributed to fluconazole.\n\tPotential for fetal harm: There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of DIFLUCAN in pregnant women. Case reports describe a pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400 to 800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If DIFLUCAN is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. Effective contraceptive measures should be considered in women of child-bearing potential who are being treated with DIFLUCAN 400 to 800 mg/day and should continue throughout the treatment period and for approximately 1 week (5 to 6 half-lives) after the final dose. Epidemiological studies suggest a potential risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities in infants whose mothers were treated with 150 mg of fluconazole as a single or repeated dose in the first trimester, but these epidemiological studies have limitations and these findings have not been confirmed in controlled clinical trials.

Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes.

Some of these cases were associated with death. Some cases occurred in patients with no known risk factors, and some were associated with droperidol doses at or below recommended doses. Physicians should be alert to palpitations, syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of episodes of irregular cardiac rhythm in patients taking INAPSINE and promptly evaluate such cases (see WARNINGS, Effects On Cardiac Conduction). The most common somatic adverse reactions reported to occur with INAPSINE (droperidol) are mild to moderate hypotension and tachycardia, but these effects usually subside without treatment. If hypotension occurs and is severe or persists, the possibility of hypovolemia should be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. The most common behavioral adverse effects of INAPSINE (droperidol) include dysphoria, postoperative drowsiness, restlessness, hyperactivity and anxiety, which can either be the result of an inadequate dosage (lack of adequate treatment effect) or of an adverse drug reaction (part of the symptom complex of akathisia). Care should be taken to search for extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, oculogyric crisis) to differentiate these different clinical conditions. When extrapyramidal symptoms are the cause, they can usually be controlled with anticholinergic agents. Postoperative hallucinatory episodes (sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression) have also been reported. Other less common reported adverse reactions include anaphylaxis, dizziness, chills and/or shivering, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm. Elevated blood pressure, with or without pre-existing hypertension, has been reported following administration of INAPSINE combined with SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) or other parenteral analgesics. This might be due to unexplained alterations in sympathetic activity following large doses: however, it is also frequently attributed to anesthetic or surgical stimulation during light anesthesia.",
    "warnings": "INAPSINE should be administered with extreme caution in the presence of risk factors for development of prolonged QT syndrome, such as: 1) clinically significant bradycardia (less than 50 bpm), 2) any clinically significant cardiac disease, 3) treatment with Class I and Class III antiarrhythmics, 4) treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI's), 5) concomitant treatment with other drug products known to prolong the QT interval (see PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS), and 6) electrolyte imbalance, in particular hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, or concomitant treatment with drugs (e.g., diuretics) that may cause electrolyte imbalance.",

Some data suggest that febrile reactions are more likely to occur in those who have experienced such responses after prior doses. 6 The frequency of local reactions and fever following DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp)  vaccination is significantly higher with increasing numbers of doses of D.P. while other mild to moderate systemic reactions (e. g., fretfulness, vomiting) are significantly less frequent. 19 If local redness 2.5 cm occurs, the likelihood of recurrence after another DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp)  dose increases significantly. 6 Evidence does not indicate a causal relation between DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp)  vaccine and SIDS. Studies showing a temporal relation between these events are consistent with the expected occurrence of SIDS over the age range in which DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp)  immunization typically occurs. 13 Deaths due to causes other than SIDS, including deaths due to serious infections, have occurred in infants following the administration of DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp) . No association has been shown for hospitalizations due to infectious disease and receipt of DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp) . 20 Approximate rates for adverse events following receipt of DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine adsorbed usp)  vaccine (regardless of dose number in the series) are indicated in TABLE 1. 2",

The brand name Duranest is discontinued, but generic versions may be available.",
    "sideEffects": "Systemic Adverse experiences following the administration of etidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or unintended intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the party of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of etidocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in multiple dose vials. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration. Other There have been rare reports of TRISMUS in patients who have received Duranest (etidocaine HCl) for dental anesthesia. Onset of symptoms occurs within hours or days upon resolution of blockade. No correlation has been demonstrated with dosage, administration technique or dental procedure. In most patients, symptoms resolved within days to weeks, although some reports have suggested that symptoms were present for many months. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, moist heat and physiotherapy was helpful in some cases.",
    "warnings": "To avoid intravascular injection, aspiration should be performed before the local anesthetic solution is injected. The needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration. Note, however, that the absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.",
    "dosage": "As with all local anesthetic agents, the dose of Duranest Injection to be employed will depend upon the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the type of regional anesthetic technique, and the physical condition and tolerance of the individual patient."
