    "description": "Tambocor is an antiarrhythmic prescribed in certain situations to prevent serious heart rhythm disorders including irregular heartbeat (such as persistent ventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). Tambocor is also used to prevent certain types of irregular heartbeat from returning (such as atrial fibrillation). Tambocor is available in generic form.",
    "sideEffects": "In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic \nPVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and\nnon-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group. (See WARNINGS.) Adverse effects reported for TAMBOCOR (flecainide) , described in detail\nin the Warnings section, were new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117\npatients with PAF; and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained\nor sustained VT. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days\nof the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias\nwhen dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some\npatients, TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac \narrest). (See WARNINGS.) New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297\npatients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients\nwith supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients\nhave developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether (see WARNINGS). The frequency of most of\nthese serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma \nlevels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1.0μg/mL. There have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum \n alkaline phosphatase and isolated elevations of serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic and no cause and\neffect relationship with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare\nreports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and hepatic failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias.\nAlthough no cause and effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  in patients who develop unexplained\n jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias in order to eliminate TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  as the possible causative agent. Incidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with\nventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration\nto 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial,\n5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects. Table 1 Most Common Non-Cardiac Adverse Effects in\nVentricular Arrhythmia Patients Treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  in the Multicenter Study",
    "warnings": "Mortality\n TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  was included in the National Heart Lung\n  and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a longterm, multicenter, randomized,\n  double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had a myocardial infarction more\n  than six days but less than two years previously. An excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in\n  patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  compared with that seen in patients assigned to a carefully matched placebo-treated group. This\n  rate was 16/315 (5.1%) for TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  and 7/309 (2.3%) for the matched placebo. The average duration of treatment with\n  TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  in this study was ten months.\nThe applicability of the CAST results to other populations\n(e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain, but at present, it is prudent to consider the risks of Class\nIC agents (including TAMBOCOR (flecainide) ), coupled with the lack of any evidence of improved survival, generally unacceptable in\npatients without life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not\nlife-threatening, symptoms or signs.\nVentricular Pro-arrhythmic Effects in Patients with Atrial \nFibrillation/Flutter\nA review of the world literature revealed reports of 568 patients treated with oral TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  for\n  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF). Ventricular tachycardia was experienced in 0.4% (2/568) of these\n  patients. Of 19 patients in the literature with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), 10.5% (2) experienced VT or VF. FLECAINIDE IS NOT\n  RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. Case reports of ventricular\n  proarrhythmic effects in patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included\n  increased PVCs, VT, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and death. As with other Class I agents, patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide) \n  for atrial flutter have been reported with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction due to slowing the atrial rate. A paradoxical\n  increase in the ventricular rate also may occur in patients with atrial fibrillation who receive TAMBOCOR (flecainide) . Concomitant negative\n  chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.",

Local reactions of the infusion site, consisting of a\nwarm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis, have been reported with\nperipheral amino acid infusions, especially if other substances are also administered\nthrough the same site. Generalized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported\nduring peripheral administration of amino acids. Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or\nmore of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of\nelectrolyte levels is essential. If electrolyte supplementation is required during\nperipheral infusion, it is recommended that additives be administered\nthroughout the day in order to avoid possible venous irritation. Irritating\nadditive medications may require injection at another site and should not be\nadded directly to the amino acid infusate. Phosphorus deficiency may lead to impaired tissue\noxygenation and acute hemolytic anemia. Relative to calcium, excessive\nphosphorus intake can precipitate hypocalcemia with cramps, tetany and muscular\nhyperexcitability. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the\ninfusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic\ncountermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed\nnecessary.",

Tolerance may be improved by\ntreatment with aspirin, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), antihistamines, or\n antiemetics. Meperidine (25 to 50 mg IV) has been shown in some patients to\ndecrease the duration of shaking chills and fever that may accompany the infusion\nof amphotericin B. Administration of amphotericin B\non alternate days may decrease anorexia and phlebitis. Intravenous administration of\nsmall doses of adrenal corticosteroids just prior to or during the amphotericin\nB infusion may help decrease febrile reactions. Dosage and duration of such\n corticosteroid therapy should be kept to a minimum (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG\nINTERACTIONS). Addition of heparin (1000 units\nper infusion), and the use of pediatric scalp-vein needle may lessen the\n incidence of thrombophlebitis. Extravasation may cause chemical\nirritation.

Cardiopulmonary: hypotension; tachypnea. Gastrointestinal: anorexia; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; dyspepsia; cramping epigastric pain. Hematologic: normochromic,\nnormocytic anemia.

Renal: decreased\nrenal function and renal function abnormalities including: azotemia,\nhypokalemia, hyposthenuria, renal tubular acidosis; and nephrocalcinosis. These\nusually improve with interruption of therapy. However, some permanent\nimpairment often occurs, especially in those patients receiving large amounts\n(over 5 g) of amphotericin B or receiving other nephrotoxic agents. In some\npatients hydration and sodium repletion prior to amphotericin B administration\nmay reduce the risk of developing nephrotoxicity.

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory: chronic, subacute, or acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. Chronic pulmonary reactions have occurred generally in patients who have received continuous treatment for six months or longer. Malaise, dyspnea on exertion, cough, and altered pulmonary function are common manifestations which can occur insidiously. Radiologic and histologic findings of diffuse interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis, or both, are also common manifestations of the chronic pulmonary reaction. Fever is prominent. The severity of chronic pulmonary reactions and their degrees of resolution appear to be related to the duration of therapy after the first clinical signs appear. Pulmonary function may be impaired permanently, even after cessation of therapy. The risk is greater when chronic pulmonary reactions are not recognized early. In subacute pulmonary reactions, fever and eosinophilia occur less often than in the acute form. Upon cessation of therapy, recovery may require several months. If the symptoms are not recognized as being drug-related and FURADANTIN therapy is not stopped, the symptoms may become more severe. Acute pulmonary reactions are commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation of pleural effusion on x-ray, and eosinophilia. Acute reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment and are reversible with cessation of therapy. Resolution often is dramatic. Changes in EKG (e.g., non-specific ST/T wave changes, bundle branch block) have been reported in association with pulmonary reactions. Cyanosis has been reported. Hepatic: Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, have occurred. Neurologic: Peripheral neuropathy, which may become severe or irreversible, has occurred. Fatalities have been reported. Conditions such as renal impairment (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine), anemia, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte imbalance, vitamin B deficiency, and debilitating diseases may increase the possibility of peripheral neuropathy.

    "sideEffects": "A few hypersensitivity reactions to Furoxone (furazolidone)  have been reported including a fall in blood pressure, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, and a vesicular morbilliform rash. These reactions subsided following withdrawal of the drug. Nausea, emesis, headache, or malaise occur occasionally and may be minimized or eliminated by reduction in dosage or withdrawal of the drug. Rarely, individuals receiving Furoxone (furazolidone)  have exhibited an Antabuse® (disulfiram)-like reaction to alcohol characterized by flushing, slight temperature elevation, dyspnea, and in some instances, a sense of constriction within the chest. All symptomatology disappeared within 24 hours with no lasting ill effects. During nine years of clinical use and approximately 3.5 million courses of therapy (in the U. S. A. alone) in the published literature and documented case reports 43 cases have been reported † of which 14 were produced under experimental conditions with planned doses of the compound in excess of those recommended. Three of these experienced a fall in blood pressure necessitating active therapy. Indications are that levarterenol (Levophed®) may be used to combat such hypotensive episodes since human studies show that this drug is not potentiated in patients treated with Furoxone (furazolidone) . (Indirectly acting pressor agents should be avoided.) The ingestion of alcohol in any form should be avoided during Furoxone (furazolidone)  therapy and for four days thereafter to prevent this reaction. Furoxone (furazolidone)  may cause mild reversible intravascular hemolysis in certain ethnic groups of Mediterranean and Near-Eastern origin, and Negroes. This is due to an intrinsic defect of red blood cell metabolism in a small percentage of these ethnic groups, making them unusually susceptible to hemolysis by numerous compounds. It is necessary to observe such patients closely while receiving Furoxone (furazolidone)  and to discontinue its use it there is any indication of hemolysis. Should not be administered to infants under 1 month of age because of the possibility of producing a hemolytic anemia due to immature enzyme systems (glutathione instability) in the early neonatal period.

    "sideEffects": "A few hypersensitivity reactions to Furoxone (furazolidone)  have been reported including a fall in blood pressure, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, and a vesicular morbilliform rash. These reactions subsided following withdrawal of the drug. Nausea, emesis, headache, or malaise occur occasionally and may be minimized or eliminated by reduction in dosage or withdrawal of the drug. Rarely, individuals receiving Furoxone (furazolidone)  have exhibited an Antabuse® (disulfiram)-like reaction to alcohol characterized by flushing, slight temperature elevation, dyspnea, and in some instances, a sense of constriction within the chest. All symptomatology disappeared within 24 hours with no lasting ill effects. During nine years of clinical use and approximately 3.5 million courses of therapy (in the U. S. A. alone) in the published literature and documented case reports 43 cases have been reported † of which 14 were produced under experimental conditions with planned doses of the compound in excess of those recommended. Three of these experienced a fall in blood pressure necessitating active therapy. Indications are that levarterenol (Levophed®) may be used to combat such hypotensive episodes since human studies show that this drug is not potentiated in patients treated with Furoxone (furazolidone) . (Indirectly acting pressor agents should be avoided.) The ingestion of alcohol in any form should be avoided during Furoxone (furazolidone)  therapy and for four days thereafter to prevent this reaction. Furoxone (furazolidone)  may cause mild reversible intravascular hemolysis in certain ethnic groups of Mediterranean and Near-Eastern origin, and Negroes. This is due to an intrinsic defect of red blood cell metabolism in a small percentage of these ethnic groups, making them unusually susceptible to hemolysis by numerous compounds. It is necessary to observe such patients closely while receiving Furoxone (furazolidone)  and to discontinue its use it there is any indication of hemolysis. Should not be administered to infants under 1 month of age because of the possibility of producing a hemolytic anemia due to immature enzyme systems (glutathione instability) in the early neonatal period. Colitis, proctitis, anal pruritus, staphylococcic enteritis, renal or hepatic toxicity have not been a significant problem with Furoxone (furazolidone) .",
