Most reactions have been of a\nhypersensitivity nature and have consisted of erythema, swelling, induration \nand/or urticaria at implantation sites. Often these reactions have occurred following an\nunrecognized or unreported positive collagen skin test. Most of the remaining\nresponses occurred in patients who became sensitized to ZYDERM collagen implant\nat some point during their course of treatment. Approximately 80% of these\nreactions occur within four weeks following the sensitizing dose. Typically, allergic reactions persist between one and\nnine months, with an average duration of four months. These reactions may be\nintermittent or continuous in nature. In rare instances, reactions have\nresolved in one or two weeks or have persisted for more than one year. Although\nseveral forms of therapy (antihistamines; oral, topical and intralesional\nsteroids) have been tried, they usually resulted in only temporary improvement.\nIn most cases, time has proved to be the determining factor in the resolution\nof these reactions. In rare instances, patients have been left with residual \nfirmness at the site of a resolved adverse reaction. On rare occasions, the hypersensitivity response has\nprogressed to a cystic reaction which may drain purulent material. The\nincidence and severity of this type of hypersensitivity response reported to\ndate has been greater with ZYPLAST collagen implant than with ZYDERM collagen implant.\nThese reactions develop weeks to months following injection and may result in\nscar formation, rarely requiring medical revision to correct. This type of\nreaction can occur as multiple and/or recurrent sterile abscesses which tend to\nbe persistent and resistant to drug therapy; careful incision and drainage has\nbeen a useful treatment. Infections at implantation sites have occurred in fewer\nthan one per thousand treated patients, and herpes simplex eruptions at sites\nwhich had been previously affected with herpes simplex have been reported in\nfewer than one per ten thousand patients. These responses resolved quickly and\nwithout sequelae. Systemic complaints have been reported by fewer than 0.5%\nof collagen implant patients. During clinical testing and subsequent monitoring\nof patient complaints following exposure to ZYDERM collagen implant, a variety\nof systemic complaints have been reported. These reports have included flu-like\nsymptoms (fever, myalgia, neuralgia, headache, nausea, malaise, or dizziness);\npruritis; rash; transient visual disturbances including blurred vision;\ntingling and numbness; transient polyarthralgia; and various systemic diseases\nincluding immune-mediated diseases. Rare anaphylactoid responses have been\nreported with ZYDERM collagen implant, including acute episodes of hypotension,\ndifficulty in breathing, tightness in chest, and/or shortness of breath. As with any injection into the head or neck, the injected\nmaterial may be inadvertently implanted in a blood vessel. Localized necrosis \nand/or sloughing, which may result in a scar, has occurred following\ninterruption of blood flow through blood vessel laceration or occlusion, or through\ntissue overdistention which compromised vascularity. The extent of necrosis has\nvaried and has been reported more frequently in the glabellar region of the\nface than in other areas; nevertheless, the incidence is less than 1% of\ntreated patients. Scar formation may also occur in conjunction with either infection\nand/or hypersensitivity responses. If implantation is followed by prolonged\nblanching or significant ecchymosis at the treatment site, gentle massage and\nclose follow-up are recommended.",
    "warnings": "A test implantation must be administered and evaluated\nprior to soft tissue deficiency correction with ZYDERM collagen implant (see Directions\nfor Use for further details). If the test implantation response is\npositive, the patient must not be treated with ZYDERM collagen implant. If the\ntest implantation response is equivocal, it is recommended that a second test\nimplantation be administered in the opposite arm and evaluated prior to the\ninitiation of treatment.",

    "sideEffects": "Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms\nsuch as generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema\nand hypotension. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions\nmay occur. Severe reactions may cause shock and loss of consciousness. Fatalities have occurred\nrarely11 . Systemic reactions occur with varying frequency in different clinics. To some extent, the\nreaction rate is related to the type and dose of administered extract and to the degree of sensitivity of\nthe patient. Despite all precautions, occasional reactions are unavoidable. Reports from regulatory\nauthorities in Sweden to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) indicated that\nseveral deaths have been associated with the use of mite extracts. CBER was subsequently informed\nthat these deaths may have been related to use by physicians or other health professionals untrained in\nthe administration of potent allergens, rather than a product defect. It should be noted that anaphylaxis\nand deaths following the injection of mite and other extracts also have been reported by the British\nCommittee on Safety in Medicine in the British Medical Journal, 293: 943, 1986. Local reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling, tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at\nthe injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several\ndays. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and\nprolonged local reactions, steroids may be helpful. The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is somewhat dependent upon the symptom complex.\nEpinephrine hydrochloride 1:1,000 aqueous, in an adult dose of 0.3 - 0.5 mL (or 0.01 mL per kg. for\nchildren) administered subcutaneously in the opposite arm is the immediate treatment of choice. A\ntourniquet should be placed above the site of the extract injection if the injection was done on the\nextremities. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Persistent wheezing may necessitate intravenous aminophylline treatment. For\nprofound shock and hypotension, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and oxygen also may be needed. Maintenance of an open airway is critical if upper airway obstruction is present. Corticosteroids may\nprovide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent.",
    "warnings": "Concentrated extract must be diluted with sterile diluent prior to first use on a patient for treatment or\nintradermal testing.

Swelling and effusion, local skin\nreactions (ecchymosis and rash), and headache occurred at equal frequency in\nthe Hyalgan®- and placebo-treated groups.\nHyalgan® treated subjects had 48/164\n(29%) incidents of gastrointestinal complaints that were not statistically\ndifferent from the placebo-treated group. A statistically significant\ndifference in the occurrence of pain at the injection site was noted in the\nHyalgan®-treated subjects: 38/164 (23%)\nin comparison to 22/168 (13%) in the placebo-treated subjects (p = 0.022).\nThere were 6/164 (4%) premature discontinuations in Hyalgan®-treated subjects due to injection site pain\nin comparison to 1/168 ( < 1%) in the placebo-treated subjects. These\ndifferences were not statistically significant. Two (2/164, 1.2%) Hyalgan®-treated subjects and 3/168 (1.8%)\nplacebo-treated subjects were reported to have positive bacterial cultures of\neffusion aspirated from the treated knee. The two Hyalgan®-treated subjects and two of the\nplacebo-treated subjects did not exhibit evidence of infection clinically or\nsubsequently and were not treated with antibiotics. One of the placebo-treated\nsubjects was hospitalized and received presumptive treatment for septic \n arthritis. Hyalgan® has been\nin clinical use in Europe since 1987. Analysis of the adverse events that have\nbeen reported with the use of Hyalgan® in\nEurope reveals that most of the events are related to local symptoms such as\npain, swelling/effusion, and warmth or redness at the injection site. Usually such\nsymptoms disappear within a few days by resting the affected joint and applying\nice locally. Only sporadically have these events been more severe and longer\nlasting.

In the integrated analysis, there were 562 patients in the groups treated with ORTHOVISC® (434 receiving 3 injections and 128 receiving 4 injections), 296 in the group treated with physiological saline, and 123 in the group treated with arthrocentesis. Adverse events occurring at >5% of the overall integrated population included: arthralgia (12.6% in the ORTHOVISC® group, 17.2% in the saline group, and 0.8% in the arthrocentesis group); back pain (6.9% in the ORTHOVISC® group, 12.2% in the saline group, and 4.9% in the arthrocentesis group); and headache NOS (12.1% in the ORTHOVISC® group, 16.6% in the saline group, and 17.9% in the arthrocentesis group).

Hyalgan is usually used in patients who have not responded to other treatments such as acetaminophen, exercise, or physical therapy.",
    "sideEffects": "Hyalgan® was\ninvestigated in a pivotal clinical investigation conducted in the United States\nin which there were three arms (164 subjects treated with Hyalgan®; 168 with placebo; and 163 with naproxen)\n(refer to Table 1). Common adverse events reported for the Hyalgan®-treated subjects were gastrointestinal \ncomplaints, injection site pain, knee swelling/effusion, local skin reactions\n(rash, ecchymosis), pruritus, and headache. Swelling and effusion, local skin\nreactions (ecchymosis and rash), and headache occurred at equal frequency in\nthe Hyalgan®- and placebo-treated groups.\nHyalgan® treated subjects had 48/164\n(29%) incidents of gastrointestinal complaints that were not statistically\ndifferent from the placebo-treated group. A statistically significant\ndifference in the occurrence of pain at the injection site was noted in the\nHyalgan®-treated subjects: 38/164 (23%)\nin comparison to 22/168 (13%) in the placebo-treated subjects (p = 0.022).\nThere were 6/164 (4%) premature discontinuations in Hyalgan®-treated subjects due to injection site pain\nin comparison to 1/168 ( < 1%) in the placebo-treated subjects. These\ndifferences were not statistically significant. Two (2/164, 1.2%) Hyalgan®-treated subjects and 3/168 (1.8%)\nplacebo-treated subjects were reported to have positive bacterial cultures of\neffusion aspirated from the treated knee. The two Hyalgan®-treated subjects and two of the\nplacebo-treated subjects did not exhibit evidence of infection clinically or\nsubsequently and were not treated with antibiotics. One of the placebo-treated\nsubjects was hospitalized and received presumptive treatment for septic \n arthritis. Hyalgan® has been\nin clinical use in Europe since 1987. Analysis of the adverse events that have\nbeen reported with the use of Hyalgan® in\nEurope reveals that most of the events are related to local symptoms such as\npain, swelling/effusion, and warmth or redness at the injection site. Usually such\nsymptoms disappear within a few days by resting the affected joint and applying\nice locally. Only sporadically have these events been more severe and longer\nlasting. Very rare cases of intra-articular infection have been reported.\nStrict aseptic technique must be followed in administering Hyalgan®. Systemic allergic reactions rarely have\nbeen recorded. Isolated cases of an anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reaction\nhave been reported in post-marketing experience and they all resolved.\nAllergic-type signs and symptoms such as rash, pruritus, and urticaria also are\nvery rare. A few cases of fever were reported. In some instances, they were\nassociated with local reactions, in other cases, no association other than\n temporal was found with the use of the product. Adverse experience data from the literature contain no\nevidence of increased risk relating to retreatment with Hyalgan®. The frequency and severity of adverse\nevents occurring during repeat treatment cycles did not increase over that\nreported for a single treatment cycle.

    "description": "HyperRHO S/D Full Dose [Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human)] is an immune globulin containing antibodies to Rho(D) recommended for the prevention of Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn by its administration to the Rho(D) negative mother within 72 hours after birth of an Rho(D) positive infant, providing the following criteria are met: 1. The mother must be Rho(D) negative and must not already be sensitized to the Rho(D) factor; and 2. Her child must be Rho(D) positive, and should have a negative direct antiglobulin test.M",
    "sideEffects": "Reactions to Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) are infrequent in Rho(D) negative individuals and consist primarily of slight soreness at the site of injection and slight temperature elevation. While sensitization to repeated injections of human immune globulin is extremely rare, it has occurred. Elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in some individuals receiving multiple doses of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) following mismatched transfusions. This is believed to be due to a relatively rapid rate of foreign red cell destruction.",
    "warnings": "HyperRHO S/D Full Dose is made from human plasma.\nProducts made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, such as viruses,\nand, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) agent that can cause\ndisease. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been\nreduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by\ntesting for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by\ninactivating and/or removing certain viruses. Despite these measures, such\nproducts can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility\nthat unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. Individuals who\nreceive infusions of blood or plasma products may develop signs and/or symptoms\nof some viral infections, particularly hepatitis C.
