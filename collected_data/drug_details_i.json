Some of these cases were associated with death. Some cases occurred in patients with no known risk factors, and some were associated with droperidol doses at or below recommended doses. Physicians should be alert to palpitations, syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of episodes of irregular cardiac rhythm in patients taking INAPSINE and promptly evaluate such cases (see WARNINGS, Effects On Cardiac Conduction). The most common somatic adverse reactions reported to occur with INAPSINE (droperidol) are mild to moderate hypotension and tachycardia, but these effects usually subside without treatment. If hypotension occurs and is severe or persists, the possibility of hypovolemia should be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. The most common behavioral adverse effects of INAPSINE (droperidol) include dysphoria, postoperative drowsiness, restlessness, hyperactivity and anxiety, which can either be the result of an inadequate dosage (lack of adequate treatment effect) or of an adverse drug reaction (part of the symptom complex of akathisia). Care should be taken to search for extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, oculogyric crisis) to differentiate these different clinical conditions. When extrapyramidal symptoms are the cause, they can usually be controlled with anticholinergic agents. Postoperative hallucinatory episodes (sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression) have also been reported. Other less common reported adverse reactions include anaphylaxis, dizziness, chills and/or shivering, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm. Elevated blood pressure, with or without pre-existing hypertension, has been reported following administration of INAPSINE combined with SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate) or other parenteral analgesics.

There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups with reference to intracranial hemorrhage. The neonates treated with indomethacin for injection also had a significantly higher incidence of transient oliguria and elevations of serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL) than did the neonates treated with placebo. The incidences of retrolental fibroplasia (grades III and IV) and pneumothorax in neonates treated with INDOCIN I.V. were no greater than in placebo controls and were statistically significantly lower than in surgically-treated neonates. The following additional adverse reactions in neonates have been reported from the collaborative study, anecdotal case reports, from other studies using rectal, oral, or intravenous indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus or in marketed use. The rates are calculated from a database which contains experience of 849 indomethacin-treated neonates reported in the medical literature, regardless of the route of administration. One year follow-up is available on 175 neonates and shows no long-term sequelae which could be attributed to indomethacin. In controlled clinical studies, only electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction (of the reactions listed below) occurred statistically significantly more frequently after INDOCIN I.V. than after placebo. Reactions marked with a single asterisk (*) occurred in 3-9 percent of indomethacin-treated neonates; those marked with a double asterisk (**) occurred in 3-9 percent of both indomethacinand placebo-treated neonates. Unmarked reactions occurred in less than 3 percent of neonates.

    "sideEffects": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 405 premature infants weighing less than or equal to 1750 g with evidence of large ductal shunting, in those neonates treated with indomethacin (n=206), there was a statistically significantly greater incidence of bleeding problems, including gross or microscopic bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, oozing from the skin after needle stick, pulmonary hemorrhage, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups with reference to intracranial hemorrhage. The neonates treated with indomethacin for injection also had a significantly higher incidence of transient oliguria and elevations of serum creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL) than did the neonates treated with placebo. The incidences of retrolental fibroplasia (grades III and IV) and pneumothorax in neonates treated with INDOCIN I.V. were no greater than in placebo controls and were statistically significantly lower than in surgically-treated neonates. The following additional adverse reactions in neonates have been reported from the collaborative study, anecdotal case reports, from other studies using rectal, oral, or intravenous indomethacin for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus or in marketed use. The rates are calculated from a database which contains experience of 849 indomethacin-treated neonates reported in the medical literature, regardless of the route of administration. One year follow-up is available on 175 neonates and shows no long-term sequelae which could be attributed to indomethacin. In controlled clinical studies, only electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction (of the reactions listed below) occurred statistically significantly more frequently after INDOCIN I.V. than after placebo. Reactions marked with a single asterisk (*) occurred in 3-9 percent of indomethacin-treated neonates; those marked with a double asterisk (**) occurred in 3-9 percent of both indomethacinand placebo-treated neonates. Unmarked reactions occurred in less than 3 percent of neonates. Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction in 41 percent of neonates, including one or more of the following: reduced urinary output; reduced urine sodium, chloride, or potassium, urine osmolality, free water clearance, or glomerular filtration rate; elevated serum creatinine or BUN; uremia. Cardiovascular: intracranial bleeding**, pulmonary hypertension. Gastrointestinal: gastrointestinal bleeding*, vomiting, abdominal distention, transient ileus, gastric perforation, localized perforation(s) of the small and/or large intestine, necrotizing enterocolitis. Metabolic: hyponatremia*, elevated serum potassium*, reduction in blood sugar, including hypoglycemia, increased weight gain (fluid retention). Coagulation: decreased platelet aggregation (see PRECAUTIONS). The following adverse reactions have also been reported in neonates treated with indomethacin, however, a causal relationship to therapy with INDOCIN I.V. has not been established: Cardiovascular: bradycardia. Respiratory: apnea, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary infection. Metabolic: acidosis/alkalosis. Hematologic: disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia.

The most serious adverse reactions encountered during continuous intrathecal or epidural infusion of INFUMORPH were respiratory depression, myoclonus, and formation of inflammatory masses. Cardiovascular System: While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsions, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Central Nervous System: myoclonus, seizures, dysphoric reactions, toxic psychosis, dizziness, euphoria, anxiety, confusion, headache. Lumbar puncture-type headache is encountered in a significant minority of cases for several days following intrathecal catheter implantation and generally responds to bed rest and/or other conventional therapy. Gastrointestinal System: Nausea, vomiting, constipation Skin: Pruritus, urticaria, wheals, and/or local tissue irritation. Genito-Urinary System: Urinary retention, oliguria, unexplained genital swelling in male patients, following infusion-device implant surgery. Other: Other adverse experiences reported following morphine therapy include depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation, peripheral edema. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

Safety information beyond\n  one year of treatment is limited and safety beyond 21 months of treatment has\n  not been established.

Common injection site conditions included erythema, lipohypertrophy, and hair\n  growth at the injection sites. Hypoglycemia was reported in 11/36 (31%) patients in the study generally rated\n  as mild and asymptomatic. Four hypoglycemic episodes were characterized as symptomatic \n  including two cases that required acute intervention. Headaches were reported in 8/36 (22%) patients in the study. One adverse event \n  of asymptomatic papilledema was reported. An adverse event of increased intracranial \n  pressure and papilledema (possible intracranial hypertension) was also reported,\n  which resolved with revision of a blocked existing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Seven of 36 (19%) patients in the study, reported an adverse event of tonsillar\n  and/or adenoid hypertrophy and 2 patients underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Increases in liver, spleen, and kidney size were noted in several patients\n  on abdominal ultrasound assessments; occasional measurements near the upper-limit-of-normal\n  were noted. Renal function (as defined by serum creatinine and calculated creatinine\n  clearance) was normal. Two patients had ovarian cysts on pelvic ultrasound and\n  one patient had sonographic evidence of hepatomegaly.

    "warnings": "Paradoxical Bronchospasm: COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol can produce paradoxical\n    bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs, the preparation should be\n    discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that\n    paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a\n    new canister.\n  Cardiovascular Effect: The albuterol sulfate contained in COMBIVENT Inhalation\n   Aerosol, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular \n   effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure and/or symptoms. If these symptoms\n    occur, discontinuation of the drug may be indicated. There is some evidence\n    from post-marketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of\n    myocardial ischemia associated with albuterol. In addition, beta-adrenergic\n    agents have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as\n    flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment\n    depression. Therefore, COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol should be used with caution\n    in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency,\n    cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.\n  Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose: Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic\n    drugs, in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an\n    unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected.\n  Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of\n    ipratropium bromide or albuterol sulfate, as demonstrated by urticaria,\n    angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. If such a\n    reaction occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol should be stopped at\n    once and alternative treatment should be considered.\n  Storage Conditions: The contents of Combivent®\n    (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate) Inhalation Aerosol are under\n    pressure. Do not puncture. Do not use or store near heat or open flame.\n    Exposure to temperatures above 120°F may cause bursting. Never throw the\n    container into a fire or incinerator.
