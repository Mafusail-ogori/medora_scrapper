Systemic side effects, principally fever, headache, malaise, rash, and\n  other reactions, such as chills, dizziness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal\n  pain have been reported in approximately 10% of vaccinees. In a study conducted by the CDC less than 5% of the 1,756 US travelers immunized\n  with a three-dose regimen of the vaccine reported headache, flu-like symptoms,\n  fever, and other systemic complaints. Hives and facial swelling were reported\n  in 0.2% and 0.1% of vaccinees, respectively. Local soreness occurred in 5.9%\n  and local redness in 2.9%. There was no increase in the number or severity of\n  reactions with increasing numbers of doses.8 The US Army studied 4,034 personnel from 1987 to 1989.11 Using a\n  two- or three-dose regimen of JE vaccine, arm soreness was described in 22.7%,\n  local redness in 4.8%, headache in 15.2%, and a febrile episode in 5.5%. In\n  another trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of a three-dose immunizing\n  series (Day 0, 7, and 30 or Day 0, 7, and 14), performed in 538 adult volunteers\n  in 1990, the Army determined that local soreness and redness occurred in 21%\n  of vaccinees after the first dose, then decreased with subsequent injections\n  (p < 0.0001, Chi-square for downward trend). Systemic symptoms including feverishness,\n  headache and rash occurred in 5% of vaccinees after the first dose, then decreased\n  with subsequent injections (p < 0.001, Chi-square for downward trend).5\n  Participants who received the third dose on Day 14 reported more side effects\n  than those who received the injection on Day 30. Among these volunteers, 252\n  received a booster injection of vaccine one year after receiving the first dose\n  of the primary series. Side effects reported after the booster injection included\n  local symptoms of soreness (24.5%) and redness (6.1%) at the injection site\n  and systemic complaints of headache (4.9%), fever (1.6%), and rash (0.8%). Less\n  than 1% of all reported symptoms was graded as severe. No generalized urticaria \n  or anaphylaxis was reported. Since 1989, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions has been reported\n  among vaccinees in Europe, North America, and Australia.12,13,14\n  The reactions have been characterized by urticaria, often in a generalized distribution,\n  or angioedema of the extremities, face, especially of the lips and oropharynx.\n  Three vaccine recipients developed respiratory distress. Distress or collapse\n  due to hypotension or other causes led to hospitalization in several cases.\n  Most reactions were treated successfully with antihistamines or oral steroids;\n  however some patients were hospitalized for parenteral steroid therapy. Three\n  patients developed an erythema multiforme or erythema nodosum and some patients\n  have had joint swelling. Some vaccinees complained of generalized itching without\n  objective evidence of a rash. An important feature of the reactions has been the interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms. Reactions after a first vaccine dose occurred after a median of 12 hours after immunization (88% of reactions occurred within 3 days). The interval between administration of a second dose and onset of symptoms generally was longer, (median 3 days and possibly as long as 2 weeks).
