Localised superficial necrosis and scarring may occur after injection in or near vessels. It is thought to result from the injury, obstruction, or compromise of blood vessels. Areas with limited collateral blood flow has an increased risk of ischaemia. Special caution should be taken if the patient has undergone a prior surgical procedure in the planned treatment area. Aspiration prior to injection is recommended.\n\tIntroduction of product into the vasculature may lead to embolization, occlusion of the vessels, ischemia, or infarction. Take extra care when injecting soft tissue fillers, for example inject the product slowly and apply the least amount of pressure necessary. Rare but serious adverse events associated with the intravascular injection of soft tissue fillers in the face have been reported and include temporary or permanent vision impairment, blindness, cerebral ischemia or cerebral hemorrhage, leading to stroke, skin necrosis, and damage to underlying facial structures. Immediately stop the injection if a patient exhibits any of the following symptoms, including changes in vision, signs of a stroke, blanching of the skin, or unusual pain during or shortly after the procedure. Patients should receive prompt medical attention and possibly evaluation by an appropriate health care practitioner specialist should an intravascular injection occur.\n\tSculptra use at specific sites in which an active inflammatory process (skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes or hives) or infection is present should be deferred until the inflammatory process has resolved and is controlled.\n\tSculptra post-treatment reactions have included delayed occurrence of subcutaneous papules and nodules. The subcutaneous papules and nodules were often confined to the injection site, typically palpable, asymptomatic and non-visible, occurring days to months after injection and had a prolonged time course to resolution. See ADVERSE REACTIONS section for details.\n\tThe kinetics of Sculptra resorption in humans has not been determined. In an intradermal implantation study in rabbits all animals had “several relatively large remnants” of injectable PLLA visible at 64 weeks after implantation. The tissue response to injectable PLLA was generally greater than the vehicle or negative plastic controls and was described as a chronic, granulomatous reaction characterized by foreign body giant cells and macrophages. The tissue reaction was confined to the area between particles, did not involve the surrounding tissue and was not unexpected, because it was consistent with the persistent and particle nature of injectable PLLA.",

    "sideEffects": "The safety of Viadur® (leuprolide acetate implant)  was evaluated in 131 patients with prostate cancer \n  treated for up to 24 months in two clinical trials. Viadur® (leuprolide acetate implant) , like other\n  LHRH analogs, caused a transient increase in serum testosterone concentrations\n  during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms of the disease during\n  the first few weeks of treatment are of concern in patients with vertebral metastases\n  and/or urinary obstruction or hematuria. If these conditions are aggravated,\n  it may lead to neurological problems such as weakness and/or paresthesia of\n  the lower limbs or worsening of urinary symptoms (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS). In the above-described clinical trials, the transient increase in serum testosterone\n  concentrations was associated with an exacerbation of disease symptoms, manifested\n  by pain or bladder outlet obstructive symptoms (urinary retention or frequency)\n  in 6 (4.6%) patients. The majority of local reactions associated with initial insertion or removal\n  and insertion of a new implant began and resolved within the first two weeks.\n  Reactions persisted in 9.3% of patients. 10.3% of patients developed application-site\n  reactions after the first two weeks following insertion. Local reactions after initial insertion of a single implant included bruising\n  (34.6%) and burning (5.6%). Other, less frequently reported, reactions included\n  pulling, pressure, itching, erythema, pain, edema, and bleeding. In these two clinical trials, four patients had local infection/inflammations\n  that resolved after treatment with oral antibiotics. Local reactions following insertion of a subsequent implant were comparable\n  to those seen after initial insertion. In the first 12 months after initial insertion of the implant(s), an implant\n  extruded through the incision site in three of 131 patients (see Insertion\n  And Removal Procedures for correct implant placement under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The following possibly or probably related systemic adverse events occurred\n  during clinical trials within 24 months of treatment with Viadur® (leuprolide acetate implant) , and were\n  reported in  ≥ 2% of patients (Table 1).

    "warnings": "Due to its potential for serious and possibly life-threatening, proarrhythmic effects, LAAM should be reserved for use in the treatment of opiate-addicted patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other adequate treatments for opiate addiction, either because of insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve effective dose due to intolerable adverse effects from those drugs (see WARNINGS and Contraindications ).  \nCases of QT prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsade de pointes) have been observed during post-marketing treatment with ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) . Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  to determine if a prolonged QT interval (QTc greater than 430 [male] or 450 [female] ms) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  should NOT be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  treatment is felt to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, an ECG should be performed prior to treatment, 12-14 days after initiating treatment, and periodically thereafter, to rule out any alterations in the QT interval.  \nORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  should be administered with extreme caution to patients who may be at risk for development of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., congestive heart failure, bradycardia, use of a diurectic, cardiac hypertrophy, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia).  \nORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  is metabolized to active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 isoform, CYP3A4. Therefore, the addition of drugs that induce this enzyme (such as rifampin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) or inhibit this enzyme (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, and saquinavir) could increase the levels of parent drug or its active metabolites in a patient that was previously at steady-state, and this could potentially precipitate serious arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ).",

In some\n    cases delayed onset of these events has been observed with a range of 21 to 142\n    days after treatment. Most events with delayed onset resolved within 18 days.\n    Injection site swelling appears to occur more frequently with the linear\n    antegrade method of injection. Rare post-market Restylane reports of immediate\n    post-injection reactions included extreme swelling of lips, the whole face and symptoms\n  of hypersensitivity such as anaphylactic shock.\n  Restylane Silk must not be implanted into blood vessels.\n    Localized superficial necrosis and scarring may occur after injection in or\n    near vessels, such as in the lips, nose, or glabellar area. It is thought to\n  result from the injury, obstruction, or compromise of blood vessels.\n  Delayed onset inflammatory papules have been reported\n    following the use of dermal fillers. Inflammatory papules that may occur rarely\n    should be considered and treated as a soft tissue infection.\n  Injections of 3.0 mL or greater (upper and lower lip\n    combined) per treatment session increases the occurrence of injection site\n    reactions. If a volume of more than 3 mL is needed to achieve optimal\n    correction, a follow-up treatment session is recommended.\n  As with all dermal filler procedures, Restylane Silk should\n    not be used in vascular rich areas. Use of similar products in these areas,\n    such as glabella and nose, has resulted in cases of vascular embolization and\n    symptoms consistent with ocular vessel occlusion, such as blindness.

Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at levels from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels of 2.0 mEq/L and above. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2.0 mEq/L. At higher levels, ataxia, giddiness, tinnitus, blurred vision, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen.

Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase. The following reactions have been reported and appear to be related to serum lithium levels, including levels within the therapeutic range: Neuromuscular/Central Nervous System: Tremor, muscle hyperirritability \n  (fasciculations, twitching, clonic movements of whole limbs), hypertonicity, \n  ataxia, choreo-athetotic movements, hyperactive deep tendon reflex, extrapyramidal \n  symptoms including acute dystonia, cogwheel rigidity, blackout spells, epileptiform \n  seizures, slurred speech, dizziness, vertigo, downbeat nystagmus, incontinence \n  of urine or feces, somnolence, psychomotor retardation, restlessness, confusion, \n  stupor, coma, tongue movements, tics, tinnitus, hallucinations, poor memory, \n  slowed intellectual functioning, startled response, worsening of organic brain \n  syndromes, myasthenia gravis (rarely). Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmia, hypotension, peripheral circulatory \n  collapse, bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction with severe bradycardia (which \n  may result in syncope). Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastritis, salivary \n  gland swelling, abdominal pain, excessive salivation, flatulence, indigestion. Genitourinary: Glycosuria, decreased creatinine clearance, albuminuria, \n  oliguria, and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus including polyuria, \n  thirst and polydipsia. Dermatologic: Drying and thinning of hair, alopecia, anesthesia of skin, \n  acne, chronic folliculitis, xerosis cutis, psoriasis or its exacerbation, generalized \n  pruritus with or without rash, cutaneous ulcers, angioedema. Autonomic: Blurred vision, dry mouth, impotence/sexual dysfunction. Thyroid Abnormalities: Euthyroid goiter and/or hypothyroidism (including \n  myxedema) accompanied by lower T3 and T4. I131 uptake may be elevated. (See \n  PRECAUTIONS.) Paradoxically, rare cases of \n  hyperthyroidism have been reported. EEG Changes: Diffuse slowing, widening of the frequency spectrum, potentiation \n  and disorganization of background rhythm. EKG Changes: Reversible flattening, isoelectricity or inversion of T-waves. \n  Miscellaneous: Fatigue, lethargy, transient scotomata, exophthalmos, dehydration, \n  weight loss, leukocytosis, headache, transient hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, \n  hyperparathyroidism, excessive weight gain, edematous swelling of ankles or \n  wrists, metallic taste, dysgeusia/taste distortion, salty taste, thirst, swollen \n  lips, tightness in chest, swollen and/or painful joints, fever, polyarthralgia, \n  dental caries. Some reports of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism which persist after lithium discontinuation have been received. A few reports have been received of the development of painful discoloration of fingers and toes and coldness of the extremities within one day of the starting of treatment with lithium. The mechanism through which these symptoms (resembling Raynaud's syndrome) developed is not known. Recovery followed discontinuance. Cases of pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure and papilledema) have been reported with lithium use. If undetected, this condition may result in enlargement of the blind spot, constriction of visual fields, and eventual blindness due to optic atrophy. Lithium should be discontinued, if clinically possible, if this syndrome occurs.",
    "warnings": "Lithium should generally not be given to patients with significant renal or cardiovascular disease, severe debilitation or dehydration, or sodium depletion, since the risk of lithium toxicity is very high in such patients. If the psychiatric indication is life-threatening, and if such a patient fails to respond to other measures, lithium treatment may be undertaken with extreme caution, including daily serum lithium determinations and adjustment to the usually low doses ordinarily tolerated by these individuals. In such instances, hospitalization is a necessity.",
    "dosage": "Lithium doses vary widely and are adjusted based on measurements of the levels of lithium in the blood. Most patients require 900-1200 mg daily in 2-3 divided doses."

    "sideEffects": "CNS Effects: Manifestations of adverse effects on the central nervous \n  system, other than extrapyramidal effects, have been seen infrequently. Drowsiness, \n  usually mild, may occur at the beginning of therapy or when dosage is increased. \n  It usually subsides with continued loxapine (loxapine (loxapine (loxapine succinate)  succinate)  succinate)  therapy. The incidence of sedation \n  has been less than that of certain aliphatic phenothiazines and slightly more \n  than the piperazine phenothiazines. Dizziness, faintness, staggering gait, shuffling \n  gait, muscle twitching, weakness, insomnia, agitation, tension, seizures, akinesia, \n  slurred speech, numbness, and confusional states have been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported (see WARNINGS). Extrapyramidal Symptoms - Neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions during \n  the administration of loxapine (loxapine (loxapine (loxapine succinate)  succinate)  succinate)  have been reported frequently, often during the \n  first few days of treatment. In most patients, these reactions involved parkinsonian-like \n  symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, excessive salivation, and masked facies. \n  Akathisia (motor restlessness) also has been reported relatively frequently. \n  These symptoms are usually not severe and can be controlled by reduction of \n  loxapine (loxapine (loxapine (loxapine succinate)  succinate)  succinate)  dosage or by administration of antiparkinson drugs in usual dosage. DystoniaClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged \n  abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals \n  during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \n  the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing \n  difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these \n  symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater \n  severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic \n  drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age \n  groups. Persistent Tardive Dyskinesia- As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive \n  dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after \n  drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly \n  patients on high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent \n  and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized \n  by rhythmical involuntary movement of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., \n  protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). \n  Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked. It has been suggested that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome, and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. Cardiovascular Effects: Tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic \n  hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope have been reported. A few cases of ECG changes similar to those seen with phenothiazines have been reported.
