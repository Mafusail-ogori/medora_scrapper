    "sideEffects": "Burning and/or stinging of short duration at the injection site have been reported. The adverse clinical reactions associated with the use of M-R-VAX (measles and rubella virus vaccine live)  II are those expected to follow administration of the monovalent vaccines given separately. These may include malaise, sore throat, cough, rhinitis, headache, dizziness, fever, rash, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; mild local reactions such as erythema, induration, tenderness and regional lymphadenopathy; thrombocytopenia and purpura; allergic reactions such as wheal and flare at the injection site or urticaria; polyneuritis, and arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic). Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Vasculitis has been reported rarely. Moderate fever [101-102.9°F (38.3-39.4°C)] occurs occasionally, and high fever [above 103°F (39.4°C)] occurs less commonly. On rare occasions, children developing fever may exhibit febrile convulsions. Afebrile convulsions or seizures have occurred rarely following vaccination with live attenuated measles vaccine. Syncope, particularly at the time of mass vaccination, has been reported. Rash occurs infrequently and is usually minimal, but rarely may be generalized. Erythema multiforme has also been reported rarely. Forms of optic neuritis, including retrobulbar neuritis, papillitis, and retinitis may infrequently follow viral infections, and have been reported to occur 1 to 3 weeks following inoculation with some live virus vaccines. Clinical experience with live attenuated measles and rubella virus vaccines given individually indicates that encephalitis and other nervous system reactions have occurred very rarely. These might occur also with M-R-VAX (measles and rubella virus vaccine live)  II. Experience from more than 80 million doses of all live measles vaccines given in the U.S. through 1975 indicates that significant central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, occurring within 30 days after vaccination, have been temporally associated with measles vaccine very rarely. In no case has it been shown that reactions were actually caused by vaccine. The Center for Disease Control has pointed out that \"a certain number of cases of encephalitis may be expected to occur in a large childhood population in a defined period of time even when no vaccines are administered\". However, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines. The risk of such serious neurological disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains far less than that for encephalitis and encephalopathy with natural measles (one per two thousand reported cases). There have been rare reports of ocular palsies, Guillain-Barr© syndrome, or ataxia occurring after immunization with vaccines containing live attenuated measles virus. The ocular palsies have occurred approximately 3-24 days following vaccination. No definite causal relationship has been established between these events and vaccination. Isolated reports of polyneuropathy including Guillain-Barr© syndrome have also been reported after immunization with rubella-containing vaccines. There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children who did not have a history of natural measles but did receive measles vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. Based on estimated nationwide measles vaccine distribution, the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed. This is far less than the association with natural measles, 6-22 cases of SSPE per million cases of measles. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the Center for Disease Control suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent higher risk of SSPE.",

    "sideEffects": "Adverse reactions to injectable contrast media fall into\ntwo categories: chemotoxic reactions and idiosyncratic reactions. Chemotoxic reactions result from the physio-chemical\nproperties of the contrast media, the dose, and speed of injection. All\nhemodynamic disturbances and injuries to organs or vessels perfused by the\ncontrast medium are included in this category. Idiosyncratic reactions include all other reactions. They\noccur more frequently in patients 20 to 40 years old. Idiosyncratic reactions\nmay or may not be dependent on the amount of dose injected, the speed of\ninjection, the mode of injection and the radiographic procedure. Idiosyncratic\nreactions are subdivided into minor, intermediate and severe. The minor\nreactions are self-limited and of short duration; the severe reactions are\nlife-threatening and treatment is urgent and mandatory. Fatalities have been reported following the\nadministration of iodine-containing contrast agents. Based upon clinical\nliterature, the incidence of death is reported to range from one in 10,000\n(0.01 percent) to less than one in 100,000 (0.001 percent). Nausea, vomiting, flushing, or a generalized feeling of\nwarmth are the reactions seen most frequently with intravascular injection.\nSymptoms which may occur include chills, fever, sweating, headache, dizziness,\npallor, weakness, severe retching and choking, wheezing, a rise or fall in\nblood pressure, facial or conjunctival petechiae, urticaria, pruritus, rash and\nother eruptions, edema, cramps, tremors, itching, sneezing and lacrimation.\nAntihistaminic agents may be of benefit; rarely, such reactions may be severe\nenough to require discontinuation of dosage. Although venous tolerance is usually good, there have\nbeen reports of a burning or stinging sensation or numbness, venospasm or\nvenous pain, and partial collapse of the injected vein. Neutropenia or\n thrombophlebitis may occur. Tissue necrosis has occurred with extravasation. Severe reactions which may require emergency measures may\ntake the form of a cardiovascular reaction characterized by peripheral\nvasodilatation with resultant hypotension and reflex tachycardia, dyspnea,\nagitation, confusion, convulsions, and cyanosis progressing to unconsciousness.\nOr, the histamine-liberating effect of these compounds may induce an\nallergic-like reaction, which may range in severity from rhinitis or\nangioneurotic edema to laryngeal or bronchial spasm or anaphylactoid shock.\nExtremely rare cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in\ndeath have been reported. Temporary renal shutdown or other nephropathy may occur. Thyroid function tests indicative of hypothyroidism or\ntransient thyroid suppression have been uncommonly reported following iodinated\ncontrast media administration to adult and pediatric patients, including\ninfants. Some patients were treated for hypothyroidism. In addition to the adverse reactions described above,\nadverse reactions may sometimes occur as a consequence of the procedure for which\nthe contrast agent is used. Adverse reactions in excretion urography\nhave included cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, anaphylaxis with severe\n asthmatic reaction, and flushing due to generalized vasodilation. In aortography,\nthe risks of procedures include injury to the aorta and neighboring organs,\n pleural puncture, renal damage including infarction and acute tubular necrosis \nwith oliguria and anuria, accidental selective filling of the right renal\nartery during the translumbar procedure in the presence of pre-existent renal\ndisease, retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the translumbar approach, spinal cord \ninjury and pathology associated with the syndrome of transverse myelitis,\ngeneralized petechiae, and death following hypotension, arrhythmia, and anaphylactoid\nreactions. Adverse reactions in pediatric angiocardiography have\nincluded arrhythmia and death. During peripheral arteriography,\ncomplications have occurred including hemorrhage from the puncture site,\n thrombosis of the vessel, and brachial plexus palsy following axillary artery\ninjections. During selective coronary arteriography with or without left\nventriculography, most patients will have transient ECG changes. Transient\narrhythmias may occur infrequently. Ventricular fibrillation may result from\nmanipulation of the catheter during the procedure or administration of the\nmedium. Other reactions may include hypotension, chest pain, and myocardial\ninfarction. Fatalities have been reported. Complications due to the procedure\ninclude hemorrhage, thrombosis, pseudoaneurysms at the puncture site, and\ndislodgment of arteriosclerotic plaques. Dissection of the coronary vessels and\ntransient sinus arrest have occurred rarely. Adverse reactions in selective renal arteriography\ninclude nausea, vomiting, hypotension and hypertension.",

The adverse clinical reactions associated with the use of M-R-VAX (measles and rubella virus vaccine live)  II are those expected to follow administration of the monovalent vaccines given separately. These may include malaise, sore throat, cough, rhinitis, headache, dizziness, fever, rash, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; mild local reactions such as erythema, induration, tenderness and regional lymphadenopathy; thrombocytopenia and purpura; allergic reactions such as wheal and flare at the injection site or urticaria; polyneuritis, and arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic). Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Vasculitis has been reported rarely. Moderate fever [101-102.9°F (38.3-39.4°C)] occurs occasionally, and high fever [above 103°F (39.4°C)] occurs less commonly. On rare occasions, children developing fever may exhibit febrile convulsions. Afebrile convulsions or seizures have occurred rarely following vaccination with live attenuated measles vaccine. Syncope, particularly at the time of mass vaccination, has been reported. Rash occurs infrequently and is usually minimal, but rarely may be generalized. Erythema multiforme has also been reported rarely. Forms of optic neuritis, including retrobulbar neuritis, papillitis, and retinitis may infrequently follow viral infections, and have been reported to occur 1 to 3 weeks following inoculation with some live virus vaccines. Clinical experience with live attenuated measles and rubella virus vaccines given individually indicates that encephalitis and other nervous system reactions have occurred very rarely. These might occur also with M-R-VAX (measles and rubella virus vaccine live)  II. Experience from more than 80 million doses of all live measles vaccines given in the U.S. through 1975 indicates that significant central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, occurring within 30 days after vaccination, have been temporally associated with measles vaccine very rarely. In no case has it been shown that reactions were actually caused by vaccine. The Center for Disease Control has pointed out that \"a certain number of cases of encephalitis may be expected to occur in a large childhood population in a defined period of time even when no vaccines are administered\". However, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines. The risk of such serious neurological disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains far less than that for encephalitis and encephalopathy with natural measles (one per two thousand reported cases). There have been rare reports of ocular palsies, Guillain-Barr© syndrome, or ataxia occurring after immunization with vaccines containing live attenuated measles virus. The ocular palsies have occurred approximately 3-24 days following vaccination. No definite causal relationship has been established between these events and vaccination. Isolated reports of polyneuropathy including Guillain-Barr© syndrome have also been reported after immunization with rubella-containing vaccines. There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children who did not have a history of natural measles but did receive measles vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. Based on estimated nationwide measles vaccine distribution, the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed. This is far less than the association with natural measles, 6-22 cases of SSPE per million cases of measles. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the Center for Disease Control suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent higher risk of SSPE.",

Experience from more than 80 million doses of all live measles vaccines given\n  in the U.S. through 1975 indicates that significant central nervous system reactions\n  such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, occurring within 30 days after vaccination,\n  have been temporally associated with measles vaccine very rarely.28\n  In no case has it been shown that reactions were actually caused by vaccine.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pointed out that “a\n  certain number of cases of encephalitis may be expected to occur in a large\n  childhood population in a defined period of time even when no vaccines are administered”.29\n  However, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have\n  been caused by measles vaccines. The risk of such serious neurological disorders\n  following live measles virus vaccine administration remains far less than that\n  for encephalitis and encephalopathy with natural measles (one per two thousand\n  reported cases).30 Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 200 million doses of M-M-R and\n  M-M-R II that have been distributed worldwide over 25 years (1971-1996) indicates\n  that serious adverse events such as encephalitis and encephalopathy continue\n  to be rarely reported.10 There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children\n  who did not have a history of natural measles but did receive measles vaccine.\n  Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first\n  year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. Based on estimated nationwide\n  measles vaccine distribution, the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination\n  is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed. This is far less than\n  the association with natural measles, 6-22 cases of SSPE per million cases of\n  measles. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the\n  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of\n  measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with\n  its inherent higher risk of SSPE.31 Respiratory System Pneumonitis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS); cough; rhinitis.",

    "sideEffects": "Treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed in the clinical study of IPLEX\n  (mecasermin rinfabate [rDNA origin] injection) in children with Primary IGFD.\n  In this study, 36 patients had an average exposure of 10.4 months (range: 27\n  days – 22.5 months), for a total of 374 patient-months. Safety information beyond\n  one year of treatment is limited and safety beyond 21 months of treatment has\n  not been established. The most common treatment-related adverse events occurring in 2 or more ( ≥ 5%)\n  subjects were iron deficiency anemia, lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, injection\n  site conditions, increased transaminases, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, arthralgia,\n  bone pain, muscular atrophy, pain in an extremity, headache, papilledema, hematuria,\n  ovarian cysts, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Common injection site conditions included erythema, lipohypertrophy, and hair\n  growth at the injection sites. Hypoglycemia was reported in 11/36 (31%) patients in the study generally rated\n  as mild and asymptomatic. Four hypoglycemic episodes were characterized as symptomatic \n  including two cases that required acute intervention. Headaches were reported in 8/36 (22%) patients in the study. One adverse event \n  of asymptomatic papilledema was reported. An adverse event of increased intracranial \n  pressure and papilledema (possible intracranial hypertension) was also reported,\n  which resolved with revision of a blocked existing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Seven of 36 (19%) patients in the study, reported an adverse event of tonsillar\n  and/or adenoid hypertrophy and 2 patients underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Increases in liver, spleen, and kidney size were noted in several patients\n  on abdominal ultrasound assessments; occasional measurements near the upper-limit-of-normal\n  were noted. Renal function (as defined by serum creatinine and calculated creatinine\n  clearance) was normal. Two patients had ovarian cysts on pelvic ultrasound and\n  one patient had sonographic evidence of hepatomegaly. Mild elevations in the serum AST and LDH were found in a significant proportion\n  of patients before and during treatment without treatment discontinuations.\n  Two patients had AST elevations that required temporary interruption of treatment.\n  Echocardiographic evidence of valvulopathy was observed in a few individuals\n  without associated clinical symptoms. Because of the underlying disease and\n  the lack of a control group, the relationship of the valvular changes to drug\n  treatment cannot be assessed. Since IGF-1 is the main mediator of GH effects and GH may produce acromegalic\n  changes, such changes should be monitored during IPLEX (mecasermin rinfabate [rdna origin] injection)  treatment. By 9 months of treatment, a proportion of patients developed antibodies to\n  the protein complex (90%), rhIGFBP-3 (50%), and/or rhIGF-1 (20%), using assays\n  with varying degrees of sensitivity.

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The major hazards of meperidine, as with other opioid analgesics, are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression; respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include: Central Nervous System: Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, transient hallucinations and disorientation, visual disturbances and, rarely, extrapyramidal reactions. Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth, constipation, biliary-tract spasm. Cardiovascular: Flushing of the face, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure Venous thrombosis at the injection site has been reported. Intra-arterial injection of MEPERGAN may result in gangrene of the affected extremity. Genitourinary:Urinary retention. Allergic: Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, wheal and flare over the vein with IV injection, photosensitivity. Photosensitivity, although extremely rare, has been reported. Occurrence of photosensitivity may be a contraindication to further treatment with promethazine or related drugs. Other: Pain at injection site; local tissue irritation, induration, and possible tissue necrosis, particularly when injection is repeated at same site; antidiuretic effect. Patients may occasionally complain of autonomic reactions, such as dryness of the mouth, blurring of vision and, rarely, dizziness following the use of promethazine. Very rare cases have been reported where patients receiving promethazine have developed leukopenia. In one instance agranulocytosis has been reported.

Persistent paresthesias of the lips, tongue, and oral tissues have been reported with the use of mepivacaine, with slow, incomplete, or no recovery. These post-marketing events have been reported chiefly following nerve blocks in the mandible and have involved the trigeminal nerve and its branches. Reactions involving the central nervous system are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Nervousness, dizziness, blurred vision, or tremors may occur followed by drowsiness, convulsions, unconsciousness, and possible respiratory arrest. Since excitement may be transient or absent, the first manifestations may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Cardiovascular reactions are depressant.

    "sideEffects": "The side effects of MESTINON are most commonly related to overdosage and generally are of two varieties, muscarinic and nicotinic. Among those in the former group are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, increased peristalsis, increased salivation, increased bronchial secretions, miosis and diaphoresis. Nicotinic side effects are comprised chiefly of muscle cramps, fasciculation and weakness. Muscarinic side effects can usually be counteracted by atropine, but for reasons shown in the preceding section the expedient is not without danger. As with any compound containing the bromide radical, a skin rash may be seen in an occasional patient. Such reactions usually subside promptly upon discontinuance of the medication. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.",
    "warnings": "Although failure of patients to show clinical improvement may reflect underdosage, it can also be indicative of overdosage. As is true of all cholinergic drugs, overdosage of MESTINON may result in cholinergic crisis, a state characterized by increasing muscle weakness which, through involvement of the muscles of respiration, may lead to death. Myasthenic crisis due to an increase in the severity of the disease is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness, and thus may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis. Such differentiation is extremely important, since increases in doses of MESTINON or other drugs of this class in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or “insensitive” state could have grave consequences. Osserman and Genkins1 indicate that the differential diagnosis of the two types of crisis may require the use of Tensilon (edrophonium chloride) as well as clinical judgment. The treatment of the two conditions obviously differs radically. Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis suggests the need for more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, the diagnosis of cholinergic crisis, according to Osserman and Genkins1, calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type. The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended.",

Cardiovascular: edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, syncope. Central Nervous System: vertigo, depression, nervousness. Dermatologic: rash. Genitourinary: urinary frequency. EENT: blurred vision, reddened sclera, epistaxis, dry mouth, nasal congestion.

Cardiovascular: tachycardia. Central Nervous System: paresthesia, hallucinations. Dermatologic: pruritus, alopecia, lichen planus. Genitourinary: incontinence, impotence, priapism. EENT: tinnitus. Other: diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA titer, arthralgia. Single reports of pigmentary mottling and serous retinopathy, and a few reports of cataract development or disappearance have been reported. In these instances, the exact causal relationship has not been established because the baseline observations were frequently inadequate. In more specific slit-lamp and funduscopic studies, which included adequate baseline examinations, no drug-related abnormal ophthalmological findings have been reported. Literature reports exist associating MINIPRESS therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases.

Syncopal episodes have usually occurred within 30 to 90 minutes of the initial dose of the drug; occasionally, they have been reported in association with rapid dosage increases or the introduction of another antihypertensive drug into the regimen of a patient taking high doses of MINIPRESS. The incidence of syncopal episodes is approximately 1% in patients given an initial dose of 2 mg or greater. Clinical trials conducted during the investigational phase of this drug suggest that syncopal episodes can be minimized by limiting the initial dose of the drug to 1 mg, by subsequently increasing the dosage slowly, and by introducing any additional antihypertensive drugs into the patient’s regimen with caution (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hypotension may develop in patients given MINIPRESS who are also receiving a beta-blocker such as propranolol.",

    "sideEffects": "Multisystem adverse reactions have been reported, and some may be serious enough to warrant hospital admission. In general, they may be divided into 2 categories: those which involve abnormal bleeding and other effects which do not. Hemorrhage and/or necrosis are among the hazards of treatment with any anticoagulant and are the main serious complications of therapy. For additional discussion of possible hemorrhagic complications following oral anticoagulant therapy see WARNINGS. Although most of the adverse reactions for oral anticoagulant drugs have been reported for warfarin, dicumarol, and phenindione, all the drugs within this class have similar pharmacologic and clinical properties, and require the same degree of caution in monitoring adverse reactions regardless of the drug administered. Some indanediones (phenindione)have been associated with undesirable reactions which have not been reported with the coumarins and are not counterbalanced by advantages, thus perhaps favoring the use of the coumarin-type anticoagulants. Changing from one chemical type of oral anticoagulant to the other may eliminate an adverse reaction, such as rash or diarrhea. Dermatitis is the only untoward reaction consistently associated with anisindione therapy. Adverse reactions reported following therapy with either coumarin or indanedione anticoagulants include:nausea, diarrhea, pyrexia, dermatitis or exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, alopecia, and sore mouth or mouth ulcers. Side effects which have additionally been reported for coumarin derivatives include:vomit-ing, abdominal cramps, anorexia, priapism, ery-thema and necrosis of the skin and other tissues, manifesting as purple toes and cutaneous gangrene. There is no reason to expect that some or all of these adverse reactions might not occur in patients receiving anisindione. Additional side effects attributed to the indane-dione anticoagulants include: headache, sore throat, blurred vision, paralysis of accommodation, steatorrhea, hepatitis, jaundice, liver damage, renal tubular necrosis, albuminuria, anuria, myeloid immaturity, agranulocytosis, leukocyte agglutinins, red cell aplasia, atypical mononuclear cells, leukopenia, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombo-cytopenia, and eosinophilia.

    "sideEffects": "THE MOST IMPORTANT FORM OF TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MITHRACIN (plicamycin)  CONSISTS OF A BLEEDING SYNDROME WHICH USUALLY BEGINS WITH AN EPISODE OF EPISTAXIS. This bleeding tendency may only consist of a single or several episodes of epistaxis and progress no further. However, in some cases, this hemorrhagic syndrome can start with an episode of hematemesis which may progress to more widespread hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract or to a more generalized bleeding tendency. This hemorrhagic diathesis is most likely due to abnormalities in multiple clotting factors. A detailed analysis of the clinical data in 1,160 patients treated with Mithracin (plicamycin)  indicates that the hemorrhagic syndrome is dose related. With doses of 30 mcg/kg/day or less for 10 or fewer doses, the incidence of bleeding episodes has been 5.4% with an associated drug-related mortality rate of 1.6%. With doses greater than 30 mcg/kg/day and/or for more than 10 doses, a significantly larger number of bleeding episodes occurred (11.9%) and the associated drug-related mortality rate was also significantly higher (5.7%). The most common side effects reported with the use of Mithracin (plicamycin)  consist of gastrointestinal symptoms: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Other less frequently reported side effects include fever, drowsiness, weakness, lethargy, malaise, headache, depression, phlebitis, facial flushing, and skin rash. The following laboratory abnormalities have been reported during therapy with Mithracin (plicamycin)  and in most instances were reversible following cessation of treatment: Hematologic Abnormalities:   Depression of platelet count, white count, hemoglobin and prothrombin content; elevation of clotting time and bleeding time; abnormal clot retraction. Thrombocytopenia may be rapid in onset and may occur at any time during therapy or within several days following the last dose. With the occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia, the infusion of platelet concentrates of platelet-rich plasma may be helpful in elevating the platelet count. The occurrence of leukopenia with the use of Mithracin (plicamycin)  is relatively uncommon, occurring only in approximately 6% of patients. It has been uncommon for abnormalities in clotting time or clot retraction to be demonstrated prior to the onset of an overt bleeding episode noted in some patients treated with Mithracin (plicamycin) . Nevertheless, the performance of these tests periodically is recommended because in a few instances, an abnormality in one of these studies may have served as a warning to terminate therapy because of impending serious toxicity. Abnormal Liver Function Tests:   Increased levels of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin, ornithine carbamyl transferase, isocitric dehydrogenase, and increased retention of bromsulphalein. Abnormal Renal Function Tests:   Increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; proteinuria.

Colchicine has been reported to cause neuromuscular toxicity, which may present as muscle pain or weakness [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Toxic manifestations associated with colchicine include myelosuppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and injury to cells in the renal, hepatic, circulatory, and central nervous system. These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage [see OVERDOSE]. The following reactions have been reported with colchicine. These have been generally reversible by interrupting treatment or lowering the dose of colchicine: Digestive: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, nausea, vomiting Neurological: sensory motor neuropathy Dermatological: alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash Hematological: leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia Hepatobiliary: elevated AST, elevated ALT Musculoskeletal: myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis Reproductive: azoospermia, oligospermia",

    "sideEffects": "The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Interactions with CNS Benzodiazepines or Other Depressants [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Inflammatory Masses [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Myoclonic Activity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Adrenal Insufficiency [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Severe Hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Withdrawal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Urinary Retention [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Orthostatic Hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of morphine were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most serious adverse reactions encountered during continuous intrathecal or epidural infusion of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP - Preservative-free were respiratory depression, myoclonus, and formation of inflammatory masses. Cardiovascular System: While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsions, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Central Nervous System: myoclonus, seizures, dysphoric reactions, toxic psychosis, dizziness, euphoria, anxiety, confusion, headache. Lumbar puncture-type headache is encountered in a significant minority of cases for several days following intrathecal catheter implantation and generally responds to bed rest and/or other conventional therapy. Gastrointestinal System: Nausea, vomiting, constipation. Skin: Pruritus, urticaria, wheals, and/or local tissue irritation. Genitourinary System: Urinary retention, oliguria, unexplained genital swelling in male patients, following infusion-device implant surgery. Other: Other adverse experiences reported following morphine therapy include depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation, peripheral edema. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Morphine Sulfate Injection USP - Preservative-free. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].",

    "sideEffects": "Bone Marrow Toxicity: This was the most common and most serious toxicity,\n  occurring in 605 of 937 patients (64.4%). Thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia\n  may occur anytime within 8 weeks after onset of therapy with an average time\n  of 4 weeks. Recovery after cessation of therapy was within 10 weeks. About 25%\n  of the leukopenic or thrombocytopenic episodes did not recover. MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  produces\n  cumulative myelosuppression. Integument and Mucous Membrane Toxicity: This has occurred in approximately\n  4% of patients treated with MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin for injection, USP). Cellulitis\n  at the injection site has been reported and is occasionally severe. Stomatitis\n  and alopecia also occur frequently. Rashes are rarely reported. The most important\n  dermatological problem with this drug, however, is the necrosis and consequent\n  sloughing of tissue which results if the drug is extravasated during injection.\n  Extravasation may occur with or without an accompanying stinging or burning\n  sensation and even if there is adequate blood return when the injection needle\n  is aspirated. There have been reports of delayed erythema and/or ulceration \n  occurring either at or distant from the injection site, weeks to months after\n  MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) , even when no obvious evidence of extravasation was observed during\n  administration. Skin grafting has been required in some of the cases. Renal Toxicity: 2% of 1,281 patients demonstrated a statistically significant\n  rise in creatinine. There appeared to be no correlation between total dose administered\n  or duration of therapy and the degree of renal impairment. Pulmonary Toxicity: This has occurred infrequently but can be severe\n  and may be life threatening. Dyspnea with a nonproductive cough and radiographic\n  evidence of pulmonary infiltrates may be indicative of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) -induced pulmonary\n  toxicity. If other etiologies are eliminated, MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  therapy should be discontinued.\n  Steroids have been employed as treatment of this toxicity, but the therapeutic\n  value has not been determined. A few cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome \n  have been reported in patients receiving MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  in combination with other\n  chemotherapy and maintained at FIO2 concentrations greater than 50%\n  perioperatively. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): This serious complication of chemotherapy,\n  consisting primarily of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hematocrit  ≤ 25%),\n  thrombocytopenia ( ≤ 100,000/mm3), and irreversible renal failure\n  (serum creatinine  ≥ 1.6 mg/dL) has been reported in patients receiving systemic\n  MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Microangiopathic hemolysis with fragmented red blood cells on peripheral\n  blood smears has occurred in 98% of patients with the syndrome. Other less frequent\n  complications of the syndrome may include pulmonary edema (65%), neurologic\n  abnormalities (16%), and hypertension. Exacerbation of the symptoms associated\n  with HUS has been reported in some patients receiving blood product transfusions.\n  A high mortality rate (52%) has been associated with this syndrome. The syndrome may occur at any time during systemic therapy with MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Less frequently, HUS has also been reported in patients receiving combinations of cytotoxic drugs not including MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Of 83 patients studied, 72 developed the syndrome at total doses exceeding 60 mg of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Consequently, patients receiving  ≥ 60 mg of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  should be monitored closely for unexplained anemia with fragmented cells on peripheral blood smear, thrombocytopenia, and decreased renal function.",

The most common adverse events (greater than 10%) reported at least once during therapy in patients treated with DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection)  were decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, urinary retention, vomiting, constipation, nausea, pruritus, pyrexia, anemia, headache, and dizziness. Adverse events occurring in 5-10% of study patients were hypoxia, tachycardia, insomnia, and flatulence. Other less common side effects (seen in 2-5% of patients receiving DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection) ) included respiratory depression, hypercapnia, paralytic ileus, somnolence, bladder spasm, abdominal distension, hypoesthesia, hypertension, oliguria, bradycardia, anxiety, back pain, increased sweating, dyspepsia, rigors, dyspnea, hypokalemia, paresthesia, and decreased hematocrit. Of the patients treated with DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection)  in clinical trials, 4% exhibited signs of respiratory depression requiring treatment with narcotic antagonists. In clinical trials, 90% of respiratory depression occurred within 24 hours after administration of DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection) . However, onset of respiratory depression occurred in 0.6% of patients after more than 48 hours. During post-marketing experience, central nervous system (CNS) depression, including obtunded feeling, non-arousable condition, unresponsiveness, confusion, and lethargy, has been reported following epidural administration of DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection) . In most of these cases with CNS depression, there was concomitant administration of different narcotics or hypnotic/sedative medications in the post operative period. During post-marketing experience, severe respiratory depression, involving\n  apnea or respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest have been reported following\n  administration of labeled doses of DepoDur (morphine sulfate xr liposome injection) .

    "sideEffects": "Bone Marrow Toxicity: This was the most common and most serious toxicity,\n  occurring in 605 of 937 patients (64.4%). Thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia\n  may occur anytime within 8 weeks after onset of therapy with an average time\n  of 4 weeks. Recovery after cessation of therapy was within 10 weeks. About 25%\n  of the leukopenic or thrombocytopenic episodes did not recover. MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  produces\n  cumulative myelosuppression. Integument and Mucous Membrane Toxicity: This has occurred in approximately\n  4% of patients treated with MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin for injection, USP). Cellulitis\n  at the injection site has been reported and is occasionally severe. Stomatitis\n  and alopecia also occur frequently. Rashes are rarely reported. The most important\n  dermatological problem with this drug, however, is the necrosis and consequent\n  sloughing of tissue which results if the drug is extravasated during injection.\n  Extravasation may occur with or without an accompanying stinging or burning\n  sensation and even if there is adequate blood return when the injection needle\n  is aspirated. There have been reports of delayed erythema and/or ulceration \n  occurring either at or distant from the injection site, weeks to months after\n  MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) , even when no obvious evidence of extravasation was observed during\n  administration. Skin grafting has been required in some of the cases. Renal Toxicity: 2% of 1,281 patients demonstrated a statistically significant\n  rise in creatinine. There appeared to be no correlation between total dose administered\n  or duration of therapy and the degree of renal impairment. Pulmonary Toxicity: This has occurred infrequently but can be severe\n  and may be life threatening. Dyspnea with a nonproductive cough and radiographic\n  evidence of pulmonary infiltrates may be indicative of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) -induced pulmonary\n  toxicity. If other etiologies are eliminated, MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  therapy should be discontinued.\n  Steroids have been employed as treatment of this toxicity, but the therapeutic\n  value has not been determined. A few cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome \n  have been reported in patients receiving MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  in combination with other\n  chemotherapy and maintained at FIO2 concentrations greater than 50%\n  perioperatively. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): This serious complication of chemotherapy,\n  consisting primarily of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hematocrit  ≤ 25%),\n  thrombocytopenia ( ≤ 100,000/mm3), and irreversible renal failure\n  (serum creatinine  ≥ 1.6 mg/dL) has been reported in patients receiving systemic\n  MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Microangiopathic hemolysis with fragmented red blood cells on peripheral\n  blood smears has occurred in 98% of patients with the syndrome. Other less frequent\n  complications of the syndrome may include pulmonary edema (65%), neurologic\n  abnormalities (16%), and hypertension. Exacerbation of the symptoms associated\n  with HUS has been reported in some patients receiving blood product transfusions.\n  A high mortality rate (52%) has been associated with this syndrome. The syndrome may occur at any time during systemic therapy with MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Less frequently, HUS has also been reported in patients receiving combinations of cytotoxic drugs not including MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Of 83 patients studied, 72 developed the syndrome at total doses exceeding 60 mg of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) . Consequently, patients receiving  ≥ 60 mg of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  should be monitored closely for unexplained anemia with fragmented cells on peripheral blood smear, thrombocytopenia, and decreased renal function.",

Pruritus often exists before dermatitis becomes apparent, \n  and therefore should be considered a warning signal of impending cutaneous reaction. \n  The most serious form of cutaneous reaction is generalized exfoliative dermatitis \n  which may lead to alopecia and shedding of nails. Gold dermatitis may be aggravated \n  by exposure to sunlight or an actinic rash may develop. Mucous membrane reactions: Stomatitis is the second most common \n  adverse reaction. Shallow ulcers on the buccal membranes, on the borders of \n  the tongue, and on the palate or in the pharynx may occur as the only adverse \n  reaction, or along with dermatitis. Sometimes diffuse glossitis or gingivitis \n  develops. A metallic taste may precede these oral mucous membrane reactions \n  and should be considered a warning signal. Conjunctivitis is a rare reaction. Renal reactions: Gold may be toxic to the kidney and produce \n  a nephrotic syndrome or glomerulitis with hematuria.

They may become severe and chronic if treatment is continued \n  after onset of the reaction. Therefore, it is important to perform a urinalysis \n  before every injection, and to discontinue treatment promptly if proteinuria \n  or hematuria develops. Hematologic reactions: Blood dyscrasia due to gold toxicity is \n  rare, but because of the potential serious consequences it must be constantly \n  watched for and recognized early by frequent blood examinations done throughout \n  treatment. Granulocytopenia; thrombocytopenia, with or without purpura; hypoplastic \n  and aplastic anemia; and eosinophilia have all been reported. These hematologic \n  disorders may occur separately or in combinations. Nitritoid and allergic reactions: Reactions of the “nitritoid \n  type” which may resemble anaphylactoid effects have been reported. Flushing, \n  fainting, dizziness and sweating are most frequently reported. Other symptoms \n  that may occur include: nausea, vomiting, malaise, headache, and weakness. More severe, but less common effects include: anaphylactic shock, syncope, \n  bradycardia, thickening of the tongue, difficulty in swallowing and breathing, \n  and angioneurotic edema. These effects may occur almost immediately after injection \n  or as late as 10 minutes following injection. They may occur at any time during \n  the course of therapy and if observed, treatment with Gold Sodium Thiomalate \n  should be discontinued. Miscellaneous reactions: Gastrointestinal reactions have been \n  reported, including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. \n  Ulcerative enterocolitis, which can be severe or even fatal, has been reported \n  rarely. There have been rare reports of reactions involving the eye such as iritis, \n  corneal ulcers, and gold deposits in ocular tissues. Peripheral and central \n  nervous system complications have been reported rarely. Peripheral neuropathy, \n  with or without, fasciculations, sensorimotor effects (including Guillain-Barré \n  syndrome) and elevated spinal fluid protein have been reported. Central nervous \n  system complications have included confusion, hallucinations and seizures. Usually \n  these signs and symptoms cleared upon discontinuation of gold therapy.",
    "warnings": "Before treatment is started, the patient's hemoglobin, erythrocyte, white blood \n  cell, differential and platelet counts should be determined, and urinalysis \n  should be done to serve as basic reference. Urine should be analyzed for protein \n  and sediment changes prior to each injection. Complete blood counts including \n  platelet estimation should be made before every second injection throughout \n  treatment. The occurrence of purpura or ecchymoses at any time always requires \n  a platelet count.",
    "dosage": "For the adult of average size the following dosage schedule for Myochrysine is suggested: Weekly Injections: 1st injection, 10 mg; 2nd injection, 25 mg; 3rd and subsequent injections, 25 to 50 mg until there is toxicity or major clinical improvement."
