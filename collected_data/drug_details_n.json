Nabi-HB is made from human plasma.\nProducts made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk that such products can transmit an infectious agent has\nbeen reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the\npresence of certain current viral infections, and by inactivating and/or reducing certain viruses. The\nNabi-HB manufacturing process includes a solvent/detergent treatment step (using tri-n-butyl phosphate\nand Triton X-100) that is effective in inactivating known enveloped viruses such as HBV, HCV, and\nHIV. Nabi-HB is filtered using a Planova 35 nm Virus Filter that is effective in reducing the levels of\nsome enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. These two processes are designed to increase product\nsafety. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the\npossibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. ALL infections thought by a\nphysician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other\nhealth care provider to Biotest Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-458-4244.

Symptoms of precipitated withdrawal were similar to those seen with other opioid antagonists, were transient following the lower doses used in the postoperative setting, and more prolonged following the administration of the larger doses used in the treatment of overdose. Tachycardia and nausea following the use of nalmefene in the postoperative setting were reported at the same frequencies as for naloxone at equivalent doses. The risk of both these adverse events was low at doses giving partial opioid reversal and increased with increases in dose. Thus, total doses larger than 1.0 µg/kg in the postoperative setting and 1.5 mg/70 kg in the treatment of overdose are not recommended.

The following adverse reactions were observed in a NARCAN Nasal Spray clinical study. In a pharmacokinetic study of 30 healthy adult volunteers exposed to one spray of NARCAN Nasal Spray in one nostril or two sprays of NARCAN Nasal Spray, one in each nostril, the most common adverse reactions were: increased blood pressure, constipation, toothache, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, headache, nasal dryness, nasal edema, nasal congestion, nasal inflammation, rhinalgia, and xeroderma. The following adverse reactions have been identified primarily during post-approval use of naloxone hydrochloride in the post-operative setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in post-operative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia, and have caused agitation. Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated an acute withdrawal syndrome. Signs and symptoms have included: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, tachycardia.

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory: chronic, subacute, or acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. Chronic pulmonary reactions have occurred generally in patients who have received continuous treatment for six months or longer. Malaise, dyspnea on exertion, cough, and altered pulmonary function are common manifestations which can occur insidiously. Radiologic and histologic findings of diffuse interstitial pneumonitis or fibrosis, or both, are also common manifestations of the chronic pulmonary reaction. Fever is prominent. The severity of chronic pulmonary reactions and their degrees of resolution appear to be related to the duration of therapy after the first clinical signs appear. Pulmonary function may be impaired permanently, even after cessation of therapy. The risk is greater when chronic pulmonary reactions are not recognized early. In subacute pulmonary reactions, fever and eosinophilia occur less often than in the acute form. Upon cessation of therapy, recovery may require several months. If the symptoms are not recognized as being drug-related and FURADANTIN therapy is not stopped, the symptoms may become more severe. Acute pulmonary reactions are commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation of pleural effusion on x-ray, and eosinophilia. Acute reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment and are reversible with cessation of therapy. Resolution often is dramatic.

Tolerance and psychologic dependence may develop by the second week of continued administration. Chloral hydrate addicts may take huge doses of the drug (i.e., up to 12 g nightly has been reported). This abuse is similar to alcohol addiction and sudden withdrawal may result in central nervous excitation, with tremor, anxiety, hallucination, or even delirium which may be fatal.

Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height. Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy. Inadequate levothyroxine dosage will produce or fail to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.",

    "genericName": "somatropin (rdna origin) for inj",
    "description": "Nutropin Depot [somatropin (rDNA origin) for injectable suspension] is a form of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) used for the long-term treatment of growth failure due to a lack of adequate endogenous GH secretion. The brand name Nutropin Depot is discontinued, but generic versions may be available.",
    "sideEffects": "As with all protein pharmaceuticals, patients may develop antibodies to the\n  protein. GH antibody-binding capacities below 2 mg/L have not been associated\n  with growth attenuation. In some cases when binding capacity exceeds 2 mg/L,\n  growth attenuation has been observed. In clinical studies of pediatric patients\n  who were treated with Nutropin Depot (somatropin (rdna origin) for inj) , 0/138 patients with GHD screened for antibody\n  production developed antibodies with binding capacities  ≥ 2 mg/L at any\n  time during a treatment period of up to 17.4 months. In addition to an evaluation of compliance with the prescribed treatment program and thyroid status, testing for antibodies to GH should be carried out in any patient who fails to respond to therapy. In studies involving 138 pediatric patients treated with Nutropin Depot (somatropin (rdna origin) for inj) , the most frequent adverse reactions were injection-site reactions, which occurred in nearly all patients. On average, 2 to 3 injection-site adverse reactions were reported per injection. These reactions included nodules (61% of injections), erythema (53%), pain post-injection (47%), pain during injection (43%), bruising (20%), itching (13%), lipoatrophy (13%), and swelling or puffiness (8%). The intensity of these reactions was generally rated mild to moderate, with pain during injection occasionally rated as severe (7%). Adverse reactions observed less frequently in the Nutropin Depot (somatropin (rdna origin) for inj)  studies which were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug by the treating physician (usually occurring 1–3 days postdose) included: headache (13% of subjects), nausea (8%), lower extremity pain (7%), fever (7%), and vomiting (5%). These symptoms were generally self-limited and well-tolerated. One patient experienced a generalized body rash that was most likely an allergic reaction to Nutropin Depot (somatropin (rdna origin) for inj) . Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD patients treated with GH. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is related to the pathology of GH deficiency itself, GH therapy, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy for intracranial tumors. On the basis of current evidence, experts cannot conclude that GH therapy is responsible for these occurrences. Other adverse drug reactions that have been reported in GH-treated patients include the following: 1) Metabolic: mild, transient peripheral edema; 2) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome; 3) Skin: rare increased growth of pre-existing nevi; patients should be monitored for malignant transformation; 4) Endocrine: gynecomastia; and 5) Rare pancreatitis. Of these reactions, only edema ( < 1% of patients) and arthralgia (4%) were reported as related to drug in the Nutropin Depot (somatropin (rdna origin) for inj)  studies.",
    "warnings": "See CONTRAINDICATIONS for information on increased mortality in patients\n  with acute critical illnesses in intensive care units due to complications following\n  open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or with acute respiratory \n  failure. The safety of continuing growth hormone treatment in patients receiving\n  replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses\n  has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation\n  with growth hormone in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed\n  against the potential risk.",
