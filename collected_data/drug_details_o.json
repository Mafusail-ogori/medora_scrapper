Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids. Corticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause acute anterior uveitis and perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, mydriasis, conjunctival hyperemia, loss of accommodation and ptosis have occasionally been reported following local use of corticosteroids. The development of secondary ocular infection (bacterial, fungal and viral) has occurred. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroid. The possibility of fungal invasion should be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used (see WARNINGS). The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with prednisolone use: Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after very frequent use of ophthalmic prednisolone, particularly in very young children.",

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may also suppress the host immune response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning. Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. IOP should be checked frequently.",

Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  to determine if a prolonged QT interval (QTc greater than 430 [male] or 450 [female] ms) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  should NOT be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  treatment is felt to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, an ECG should be performed prior to treatment, 12-14 days after initiating treatment, and periodically thereafter, to rule out any alterations in the QT interval.  \nORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  should be administered with extreme caution to patients who may be at risk for development of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., congestive heart failure, bradycardia, use of a diurectic, cardiac hypertrophy, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia).  \nORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate)  is metabolized to active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 isoform, CYP3A4. Therefore, the addition of drugs that induce this enzyme (such as rifampin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) or inhibit this enzyme (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, and saquinavir) could increase the levels of parent drug or its active metabolites in a patient that was previously at steady-state, and this could potentially precipitate serious arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ).",

    "sideEffects": "Some people on alli™ (orlistat 60 mg)  will experience GI side effects, which is expected since alli (orlistat 60 mg)  works by inhibiting about 25% of dietary fat. alli (orlistat 60 mg)  is half the strength of prescription Xenical® (orlistat 120 mg), and, as a result, has fewer GI events overall than Xenical®. In clinical trials, subjects on 120 mg withdrew due to GI adverse events at a rate of 5.4%-and at 60 mg it was only 3.2%. The main treatment effect occurs when an individual eats a meal with too much fat while taking alli (orlistat 60 mg) . Treatment effects may include: Loose or more frequent stools that may be hard to control An urgent need to go to the bathroom Gas with oily spotting While excess fat that is excreted is not harmful, patients could be distressed by the experience. Treatment effects can be lessened if an individual sticks with reduced-calorie, low-fat meals that average 15 grams of fat per meal (or 30% fat or less). Diets may vary from 1,200 calories to 1,800 calories per day, so 15 grams is an average. Individuals need to be aware of hidden fat in food, so that they can lower the chance of having treatment effects. Not all individuals will experience treatment effects, but those that do can reduce the likelihood of these effects by taking alli (orlistat 60 mg)  as directed and sticking with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet. The alli (orlistat 60 mg)  starter pack includes portable reference guides and online support at myalli (orlistat 60 mg) .com to help patients follow the program accurately. Some patients may experience treatment effects as they begin therapy until they learn to adjust their diet.",

    "sideEffects": "The incidence of common adverse reactions (above 1%) was obtained from a population of 835 Orudis (ketoprofen) -treated patients in double-blind trials lasting from 4 to 54 weeks and in 622 Oruvail-treated (200 mg/day) patients in trials lasting from 4 to 16 weeks. Minor gastrointestinal side effects predominated; upper gastrointestinal symptoms were more common than lower gastrointestinal symptoms. In crossover trials in 321 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, there was no difference in either upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms between patients treated with 200 mg of Oruvail (ketoprofen) once a day or 75 mg of Orudis (ketoprofen) TID (225 mg/day). Peptic ulcer or GI bleeding occurred in controlled clinical trials in less than 1% of 1,076 patients; however, in open label continuation studies in 1,292 patients the rate was greater than 2%. The incidence of peptic ulceration in patients on NSAIDs is dependent on many risk factors including age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, diet, stress, concomitant drugs such as aspirin and corticosteroids, as well as the dose and duration of treatment with NSAIDs (see \"WARNINGS\"). Gastrointestinal reactions were followed in frequency by central nervous system side effects, such as headache, dizziness, or drowsiness. The incidence of some adverse reactions appears to be dose-related (see \"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\"). Rare adverse reactions (incidence less than 1%) were collected from one or more of the following sources: foreign reports to manufacturers and regulatory agencies, publications, U.S. clinical trials, and/or U.S. postmarketing spontaneous reports. Reactions are listed below under body system, then by incidence or number of cases in decreasing incidence. Incidence Greater than 1% (Probable Causal Relationship) Digestive: Dyspepsia (11%), nausea*, abdominal pain*, diarrhea*, constipation*, flatulence*, anorexia, vomiting, stomatitis. Nervous System: Headache*, dizziness, CNS inhibition (i.e., pooled reports of somnolence, malaise, depression, etc.) or excitation (i.e., insomnia, nervousness, dreams, etc.)*. Special Senses: Tinnitus, visual disturbance. Skin and Appendages: Rash. Urogenital: Impairment of renal function (edema, increased BUN)*, signs or symptoms of urinary-tract irritation. * Adverse events occurring in 3 to 9% of patients. Incidence Less than 1% (Probable Causal Relationship) Body as a Whole: Chills, facial edema, infection, pain, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis. Cardiovascular: Hypertension, palpitation, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vasodilation. Digestive: Appetite increased, dry mouth, eructation, gastritis, rectal hemorrhage, melena, fecal occult blood, salivation, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal perforation, hematemesis, intestinal ulceration, hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, jaundice.

The less severe adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with ROXICODONE® are also typical\nopioid side effects.

They should\nbe expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent of these include nausea,\nconstipation, vomiting, headache, and pruritus.

    "description": "Terramycin (oxytetracycline intramuscular solution) is an antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. The brand name drug Terramycin is no longer available in the U.S., but generic versions may still be available.",
    "sideEffects": "Local irritation may be present after intramuscular injection. The injection should be deep, with care taken not to injure the sciatic nerve nor inject intravascularly. Gastrointestinal:  anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Skin:  maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See \" WARNINGS \"). Renal toxicity:  Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See \" Warnings \"). Hypersensitivity reactions:  Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults have been reported in individuals receiving full therapeutic dosages. These conditions disappeared rapidly when the drug was discontinued. Blood:  Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur.",
    "warnings": "THE USE OF TETRACYCLINES DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINES, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.",
    "dosage": "The usual daily adult dose of Terramycin is 250 mg administered once every 24 hours or 300 mg given in divided doses at 8 to 12 hour intervals. For children above eight years of age the dose is determined by the child's body weight."

The brand name Terra-Cortril is discontinued, but generic versions may be available.",
    "sideEffects": "Allergic reactions due to individual hypersensitivity including contact dermatitis may occur but are rare. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the oxytetracycline are allergic sensitizations. Increased Lacrimation, a transient stinging or burning sensation, and a foreign body sensation have been reported occasionally with opthalmic tetracycline products. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing. Should signs of local irritation occur, discontinue treatment immediately. Elevation of intraocular pressure - see †?Warnings†. Secondary infection: The development of secondary bacterial or fungal infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroid. With long-term applications of steroids, the cornea is particularly prone to develop fungal infections. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. The use of Terra-Cortril (oxytetracycline and hydrocortisone)  Eye/Ear Suspension with Polymixin B and Terra-Cortril (oxytetracycline and hydrocortisone)  Eye/Ear ointment with Polymixin B should be discontinued if such reactions occur.",
    "warnings": "Corneal ulceration may be aggravated by the presence of the steroid. It is important that corneal ulcers are correctly diagnosed before treatment with Terra-Cortril (oxytetracycline and hydrocortisone)  is initiated.",
    "dosage": "For the eye, instill one to two drops of Terra-Cortril suspension into the affected eye three times daily. For the ear, instill two to four drops into the affected ear three times daily."
