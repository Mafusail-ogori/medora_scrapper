    "sideEffects": "To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aspen Global Inc. Toll-Free at 1-855-800-8165or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The most frequent adverse reaction to thioguanine is myelosuppression. The induction of complete remission of acute myelogenous leukemia usually requires combination chemotherapy in dosages which produce marrow hypoplasia. Since consolidation and maintenance of remission are also effected by multiple-drug regimens whose component agents cause myelosuppression, pancytopenia is observed in nearly all patients. Dosages and schedules must be adjusted to prevent life-threatening cytopenias whenever these adverse reactions are observed. Hyperuricemia frequently occurs in patients receiving thioguanine as a consequence of rapid cell lysis accompanying the antineoplastic effect. Adverse effects can be minimized by increased hydration, urine alkalinization, and the prophylactic administration of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor such as ZYLOPRIM® (allopurinol). Unlike PURINETHOL (mercaptopurine) and IMURAN® (azathioprine),thioguanine may be continued in the usual dosage when allopurinol is used conjointly to inhibit uric acidformation. Less frequent adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and stomatitis. Intestinal necrosis and perforation have been reported in patients who received multiple-drug chemotherapy including thioguanine.",

Tambocor is also used to prevent certain types of irregular heartbeat from returning (such as atrial fibrillation). Tambocor is available in generic form.",
    "sideEffects": "In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic \nPVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  therapy was found to be associated with a 5.1% rate of death and\nnon-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group. (See WARNINGS.) Adverse effects reported for TAMBOCOR (flecainide) , described in detail\nin the Warnings section, were new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117\npatients with PAF; and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained\nor sustained VT. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained VT, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days\nof the onset of therapy. 198 patients with sustained VT experienced a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias\nwhen dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In some\npatients, TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable VT or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac \narrest). (See WARNINGS.) New or worsened CHF occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained VT. Of 297\npatients with sustained VT, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. New or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 patients\nwith supraventricular arrhythmias. There have also been instances of second- (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients\nhave developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest, about 1.2% altogether (see WARNINGS). The frequency of most of\nthese serious adverse events probably increases with higher trough plasma \nlevels, especially when these trough levels exceed 1.0μg/mL. There have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum \n alkaline phosphatase and isolated elevations of serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic and no cause and\neffect relationship with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare\nreports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and hepatic failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias.\nAlthough no cause and effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  in patients who develop unexplained\n jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias in order to eliminate TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  as the possible causative agent. Incidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with\nventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration\nto 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial,\n5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects.

    "warnings": "Mortality\n TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  was included in the National Heart Lung\n  and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a longterm, multicenter, randomized,\n  double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had a myocardial infarction more\n  than six days but less than two years previously. An excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in\n  patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  compared with that seen in patients assigned to a carefully matched placebo-treated group. This\n  rate was 16/315 (5.1%) for TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  and 7/309 (2.3%) for the matched placebo. The average duration of treatment with\n  TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  in this study was ten months.\nThe applicability of the CAST results to other populations\n(e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain, but at present, it is prudent to consider the risks of Class\nIC agents (including TAMBOCOR (flecainide) ), coupled with the lack of any evidence of improved survival, generally unacceptable in\npatients without life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not\nlife-threatening, symptoms or signs.\nVentricular Pro-arrhythmic Effects in Patients with Atrial \nFibrillation/Flutter\nA review of the world literature revealed reports of 568 patients treated with oral TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  for\n  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF). Ventricular tachycardia was experienced in 0.4% (2/568) of these\n  patients. Of 19 patients in the literature with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), 10.5% (2) experienced VT or VF. FLECAINIDE IS NOT\n  RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. Case reports of ventricular\n  proarrhythmic effects in patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide)  for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included\n  increased PVCs, VT, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and death. As with other Class I agents, patients treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide) \n  for atrial flutter have been reported with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction due to slowing the atrial rate. A paradoxical\n  increase in the ventricular rate also may occur in patients with atrial fibrillation who receive TAMBOCOR (flecainide) . Concomitant negative\n  chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.",

Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS.) Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS.) Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See WARNINGS.) Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in adults. (See WARNINGS.) When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland.

Tasmar is usually reserved for use only in people who have used carbidopa and levodopa without success in treating their Parkinson's disease. When used with carbidopa and levodopa, Tasmar increases levels of levodopa in the body.",
    "sideEffects": "Cases of severe hepatocellular injury, including fulminant liver failure resulting in death, have been reported in postmarketing use. As of May 2005, three cases of fatal fulminant hepatic failure have been reported from more than 40,000 patient years of worldwide use. This incidence may be 10- to 100-fold higher than the background incidence in the general population. All three cases were reported within the first six months of initiation of treatment with TASMAR. Analysis of the laboratory monitoring data in over 3,400 TASMAR-treated patients participating in clinical trials indicated that increases in SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST, when present, generally occurred within the first 6 months of treatment with TASMAR. The imprecision of the estimated increase is due to uncertainties about the base rate and the actual number of cases occurring in association with TASMAR. The incidence of idiopathic potentially fatal fulminant hepatic failure (i.e., not due to viral hepatitis or alcohol) is low. One estimate, based upon transplant registry data, is approximately 3/1,000,000 patients per year in the United States. Whether this estimate is an appropriate basis for estimating the increased risk of liver failure among TASMAR users is uncertain. TASMAR users, for example, differ in age and general health status from candidates for liver transplantation. Similarly, underreporting of cases may lead to significant underestimation of the increased risk associated with the use of TASMAR. During the premarketing development of tolcapone, two distinct patient populations were studied, patients with end-of-dose wearing-off phenomena and patients with stable responses to levodopa therapy. All patients received concomitant treatment with levodopa preparations, however, and were similar in other clinical aspects. Adverse reactions are shown for these two populations combined. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (N=892), with a difference in incidence (TASMAR minus Placebo) of at least 5% or greater in the 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR-treated groups compared to placebo, were dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, sleep disorder, vomiting, urine discoloration, somnolence, hallucination, dystonia, and sweating. Approximately 16% of the 592 patients who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 10% of the 298 patients who received placebo. Diarrhea was by far the most frequent cause of discontinuation (approximately 6% in tolcapone patients vs. 1% on placebo).",
    "warnings": "(see BOXED WARNING) Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, TASMAR (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease on l-dopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies (see INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).",

NERVOUS SYSTEM The following neurologic illnesses have been reported as temporally associated with vaccines containing tetanus toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid)  toxoid) : neurological complications 18,19 including cochlear lesion, 20 brachial plexus neuropathies, 20,21 paralysis of the radial nerve, 22 paralysis of the recurrent nerve, 20 accommodation paresis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and EEG disturbances with encephalopathy. The IOM, following review of the reports of neurologic events following vaccination with tetanus toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid)  toxoid) , DT or Td, concluded the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship between tetanus toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid)  toxoid)  and brachial neuritis and GBS.17,23 Reporting of Adverse Events The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, requires physicians and other health-care providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent vaccination records and to report occurrences of certain adverse events to the US Department of Health and Human Services.11-13 Reportable events include those listed in the Act for each vaccine and events such as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock within 7 days, brachial neuritis within 28 days; any acute complication or sequela (including death) of an illness, 5 disability, injury, or condition referred to above, or any events that would contraindicate further doses of vaccine, according to this Tetanus Toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid)  toxoid)  for Booster Use Only package insert. Adverse events following immunization with vaccine should be reported by health-care providers to the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reporting forms and information about reporting requirements or completion of the form can be obtained from VAERS through a toll-free number 1-800-822-7967.11-13 Health-care providers also should report these events to the Pharmacovigilance Department, Aventis Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370 or call 1-800-822-2463.",

    "sideEffects": "Generally, side effects have been infrequent.",
    "warnings": "Large doses of Tham Solution may depress ventilation, as\n    a result of increased blood pH and reduced CO2 concentration. Thus,\n    dosage should be adjusted so that blood pH is not allowed to increase above\n    normal. In situations in which respiratory acidosis may be present\n    concomitantly with metabolic acidosis, the drug may be used with mechanical assistance\n    to ventilation.\n  Care must be exercised to prevent perivascular\n    infiltration since this can cause inflammation, necrosis and sloughing of tissue.\n    Venospasm and intravenous thrombosis, which may occur during infusion, can be\n    minimized by insuring that the injection needle is well within the largest\n    available vein and that solutions are slowly infused. Intravenous catheters are\n    recommended. If perivascular infiltration occurs, institute appropriate\n    countermeasures See ADVERSE REACTIONS.\n  Tham Solution (tromethamine injection) should be\n    administered slowly and in amounts sufficient only to correct the existing acidosis,\n    and to avoid overdosage and alkalosis. Overdosage in terms of total drug and/or\n    too rapid administration, may cause hypoglycemia of a prolonged duration\n    (several hours). Therefore, frequent blood glucose determinations should be made\n    during and after therapy.\n  Extreme care should be exercised in patients with renal\n    disease or reduced urinary output because of potential hyperkalemia and the\n    possibility of a decreased excretion of tromethamine. In such patients, the\n    drug should be used cautiously with electrocardiographic monitoring and\n    frequent serum potassium determinations.\n  Because clinical experience has been limited generally to\n    short-term use, the drug should not be administered for more than a period of\n    one day except in a life-threatening situation.",

    "sideEffects": "Adverse reactions associated with theophylline are generally mild when peak serum theophylline concentrations are <20 mcg/mL and mainly consist of transient caffeine-like adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and insomnia. When peak serum theophylline concentrations exceed 20 mcg/mL, however, theophylline produces a wide range of adverse reactions including persistent vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and intractable seizures which can be lethal (see OVERDOSAGE). The transient caffeine-like adverse reactions occur in about 50% of patients when theophylline therapy is initiated at doses higher than recommended initial doses (e.g., >300 mg/day in adults and >12 mg/kg/day in children beyond 1 year of age). During the initiation of theophylline therapy, caffeine-like adverse effects may transiently alter patient behavior, especially in school age children, but this response rarely persists. Initiation of theophylline therapy at a low dose with subsequent slow titration to a predetermined age-related maximum dose will significantly reduce the frequency of these transient adverse effects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table V). In a small percentage of patients (<3% of children and <10% of adults) the caffeine-like adverse effects persist during maintenance therapy, even at peak serum theophylline concentrations within the therapeutic range (i.e., 10 - 20 mcg/mL). Dosage reduction may alleviate the caffeine-like adverse effects in these patients, however, persistent adverse effects should result in a reevaluation of the need for continued theophylline therapy and the potential therapeutic benefit of alternative treatment.

Dosages and schedules must be adjusted to prevent life-threatening cytopenias whenever these adverse reactions are observed. Hyperuricemia frequently occurs in patients receiving thioguanine as a consequence of rapid cell lysis accompanying the antineoplastic effect.

The brand name Thorazine is discontinued in the U.S. Generic forms may be available.",
    "sideEffects": "Note: Some adverse effects of Thorazine (chlorpromazine)  may be more likely to occur, or occur \n  with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g., patients \n  with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension \n  following recommended doses. Drowsiness, usually mild to moderate, may occur, particularly during \n  the first or second week, after which it generally disappears. If troublesome, \n  dosage may be lowered. B Overall incidence has been low, regardless of indication or dosage. Most \n  investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between \n  the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious \n  hepatitis, with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice, rather than those \n  of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the \n  medication; however, chronic jaundice has been reported. There is no conclusive evidence that preexisting liver disease makes patients \n  more susceptible to jaundice. Alcoholics with cirrhosis have been successfully \n  treated with Thorazine (chlorpromazine) without complications. Nevertheless, \n  the medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Patients \n  who have experienced jaundice with a phenothiazine should not, if possible, \n  be reexposed to Thorazine (chlorpromazine)  or other phenothiazines. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should \n  be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment. Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic \n  obstruction; withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction \n  is confirmed. Hematological Disorders, including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, \n  hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia \n  have been reported. Agranulocytosis — Warn patients to report the sudden appearance \n  of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential \n  counts indicate cellular depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and \n  other suitable therapy. Most cases have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy; patients \n  should be watched closely during that period. Moderate suppression of white blood cells is not an indication for stopping \n  treatment unless accompanied by the symptoms described above.",
    "warnings": "The extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to Thorazine (chlorpromazine) \n  may be confused with the central nervous system signs of an undiagnosed primary \n  disease responsible for the vomiting, e.g., Reye's syndrome or other encephalopathy. \n  The use of Thorazine (chlorpromazine)  and other potential hepatotoxins should be avoided in children \n  and adolescents whose signs and symptoms suggest Reye's syndrome.",

Approximately 21% of the 2531 patients who received GABITRIL in clinical trials of epilepsy discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with discontinuation were dizziness (1.7%), somnolence (1.6%), depression (1.3%), confusion (1.1%), and asthenia (1.1%). In Studies 1 and 2 (U.S. studies), the double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, add-on studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 11% for the group treated with GABITRIL and 6% for the placebo group.

Dose may be an important predisposing factor in the development of seizures, although seizures have been reported in patients taking daily doses of GABITRIL as low as 4 mg/day. In most cases, patients were using concomitant medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, narcotics) that are thought to lower the seizure threshold. Some seizures occurred near the time of a dose increase, even after periods of prior stable dosing. The GABITRIL dosing recommendations in current labeling for treatment of epilepsy were based on use in patients with partial seizures 12 years of age and older, most of whom were taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone and phenobarbital) which lower plasma levels of GABITRIL by inducing its metabolism.

Hypoglycemia: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. Gastrointestinal Reactions: Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely; TOLINASE (tolazamide)  Tablets should be discontinued if this occurs. Gastrointestinal disturbances, eg, nausea, epigastric fullness, and heartburn, are the most common reactions and occurred in 1% of patients treated during clinical trials.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sul-fonylureas, and it has been suggested that these sul-fonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH.

    "warnings": "SPECIAL WARNINGS ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (DIABETES, 19 (supp. 2):747-830, 1970.) UGDP reported that patients treated for five to eight years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbu-tamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 21/2 times that of patients with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of TOLINASE (tolazamide)  and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.",

Tasmar is usually reserved for use only in people who have used carbidopa and levodopa without success in treating their Parkinson's disease. When used with carbidopa and levodopa, Tasmar increases levels of levodopa in the body.",
    "sideEffects": "Cases of severe hepatocellular injury, including fulminant liver failure resulting in death, have been reported in postmarketing use. As of May 2005, three cases of fatal fulminant hepatic failure have been reported from more than 40,000 patient years of worldwide use. This incidence may be 10- to 100-fold higher than the background incidence in the general population. All three cases were reported within the first six months of initiation of treatment with TASMAR. Analysis of the laboratory monitoring data in over 3,400 TASMAR-treated patients participating in clinical trials indicated that increases in SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST, when present, generally occurred within the first 6 months of treatment with TASMAR. The imprecision of the estimated increase is due to uncertainties about the base rate and the actual number of cases occurring in association with TASMAR. The incidence of idiopathic potentially fatal fulminant hepatic failure (i.e., not due to viral hepatitis or alcohol) is low. One estimate, based upon transplant registry data, is approximately 3/1,000,000 patients per year in the United States. Whether this estimate is an appropriate basis for estimating the increased risk of liver failure among TASMAR users is uncertain. TASMAR users, for example, differ in age and general health status from candidates for liver transplantation. Similarly, underreporting of cases may lead to significant underestimation of the increased risk associated with the use of TASMAR. During the premarketing development of tolcapone, two distinct patient populations were studied, patients with end-of-dose wearing-off phenomena and patients with stable responses to levodopa therapy. All patients received concomitant treatment with levodopa preparations, however, and were similar in other clinical aspects. Adverse reactions are shown for these two populations combined. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (N=892), with a difference in incidence (TASMAR minus Placebo) of at least 5% or greater in the 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR-treated groups compared to placebo, were dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, sleep disorder, vomiting, urine discoloration, somnolence, hallucination, dystonia, and sweating. Approximately 16% of the 592 patients who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 10% of the 298 patients who received placebo. Diarrhea was by far the most frequent cause of discontinuation (approximately 6% in tolcapone patients vs. 1% on placebo).",
    "warnings": "(see BOXED WARNING) Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, TASMAR (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease on l-dopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies (see INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).",

These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of TOLINASE (tolazamide) ; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Reactions: Leukopenia, agranulocy-tosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplas-tic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Reactions: Hepatic porphyria and disul-firam-like reactions have been reported with sul-fonylureas; however, disulfiram-like reactions with TOLINASE (tolazamide)  have been reported very rarely. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with tolazamide and all other sulfonylureas, most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sul-fonylureas, and it has been suggested that these sul-fonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH. Miscellaneous: Weakness, fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, malaise and headache were reported infrequently in patients treated during clinical trials. The relationship to therapy with TOLINASE (tolazamide)  is difficult to assess.",
    "warnings": "SPECIAL WARNINGS ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (DIABETES, 19 (supp. 2):747-830, 1970.) UGDP reported that patients treated for five to eight years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbu-tamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 21/2 times that of patients with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of TOLINASE (tolazamide)  and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.",

Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Serious - Akathisia, agitation, motor restlessness, dystonic reactions, trismus, torticollis, opisthotonos, oculogyric crises, tremor, muscular rigidity, akinesia - some of which have persisted for several months or years especially in patients of advanced age with brain damage. Endocrine Disturbances: Menstrual irregularities, altered libido, gynecomastia, weight gain. False positive pregnancy tests have been reported. Urinary Disturbances: Retention, incontinence. Allergic Reactions: Serious - Fever, laryngeal edema, angioneurotic edema, asthma. Others: Hyperpyrexia. Behavioral effects suggestive of a paradoxical reaction have been reported. These include excitement, bizarre dreams, aggravation of psychoses and toxic confusional states. While there is no evidence at present that ECG changes observed in patients receiving phenothiazines are in any way precursors of any significant disturbance of cardiac rhythm, it should be noted that sudden and unexpected deaths apparently due to cardiac arrest have been reported in a few instances in hospitalized psychotic patients previously showing characteristic ECG changes. A peculiar skin-eye syndrome has also been recognized as a side effect following long-term treatment with certain phenothiazines. This reaction is marked by progressive pigmentation of areas of the skin or conjunctiva and/or accompanied by discoloration of the exposed sclera and cornea. Opacities of the anterior lens and cornea described as irregular or stellate in shape have also been reported. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE TORECAN (thiethylperazine) is not a controlled substance.",

Although Azmacort (triamcinolone acetonide (inhalation aerosol))  Inhalation Aerosol may \n  provide control of asthmatic symptoms during these episodes, in recommended \n  doses it supplies only normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically \n  and does NOT provide the increased systemic steroid which is necessary for coping \n  with these emergencies.",

A subset of over 1, 000 German and US children were monitored for adverse events through a fourth successive dose of Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine. A subset of 580 German children were monitored for adverse events through a fifth successive dose of Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine. Over 400 children who had received three doses of whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine were assessed for adverse events following a booster dose of Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine at 15 to 20 months of age. In a double-blind, comparative US trial, 673 infants were randomized to receive either 3 doses of Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine or AvPs whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine (Table 2).2  Safety data are available for 672 infants, including 505 who received Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine and 167 who received whole-cell pertussis DTP vaccine. Following all three doses, rates for all reported local reactions, fever > 101°F, irritability, drowsiness, and anorexia were significantly less in Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine)  vaccine recipients.

Overdosage in terms of total drug and/or\n    too rapid administration, may cause hypoglycemia of a prolonged duration\n    (several hours). Therefore, frequent blood glucose determinations should be made\n    during and after therapy.\n  Extreme care should be exercised in patients with renal\n    disease or reduced urinary output because of potential hyperkalemia and the\n    possibility of a decreased excretion of tromethamine. In such patients, the\n    drug should be used cautiously with electrocardiographic monitoring and\n    frequent serum potassium determinations.\n  Because clinical experience has been limited generally to\n    short-term use, the drug should not be administered for more than a period of\n    one day except in a life-threatening situation.",

Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. Local reaction at the infusion site, consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis, have been reported with peripheral amino acid infusions, especially if other substances are also administered through the same site. If electrolyte supplementation is required during peripheral infusion, it is recommended that additives be administered throughout the day in order to avoid possible venous irritation. Irritating additive medications may require injection at another site and should not be added directly to the amino acid infusate. Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential. Phosphorus deficiency may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and acute hemolytic anemia. Relative to calcium, excessive phosphorus intake can precipitate hypocalcemia with cramps, tetany and muscular hyperexcitability. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.",
