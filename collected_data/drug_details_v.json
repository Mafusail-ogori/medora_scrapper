    "sideEffects": "Adverse reactions were assessed in placebo and active-drug controlled trials of 4-12 weeks duration and longer-term uncontrolled studies. The most common side effects occurring more frequently than in control groups were upper gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, dyspepsia or GI distress) in about 22%, diarrhea in about 8%, dizziness in about 15%, asthenia in about 10% and nervousness in about 7%. The adverse reactions seen in at least 2% of bepridil patients in controlled trials are shown in the following table.",
    "warnings": "Induction of New Serious Arrhythmias  \nVASCOR (bepridil hydrochloride) has Class 1 anti-arrhythmic properties and, like other such drugs, can induce new arrhythmias, including VT/VF. In addition, because of its ability to prolong the QT interval, VASCOR (bepridil)  can cause torsades de pointes type ventricular tachycardia. Because of these properties VASCOR (bepridil)  should be reserved for patients in whom other anti-anginal agents do not offer a satisfactory effect.  \nIn US clinical trials, the QT and QTc intervals were commonly prolonged by VASCOR (bepridil)  in a dose-related fashion. While the mean prolongation of QTc was 8% and of QT was 10%. Increases of 25% or more were not uncommon, occurring in 5% of the studied population for QTc and 8.7% of the studied population for QT. Increased QT and QTc may be associated with torsades de pointes type VT, which was seen at least briefly, in about 1.0% of patients in US trials; in many cases, however, patients with marked prolongation of QTc were taken off VASCOR (bepridil)  therapy. All of the US patients with torsades de pointes had a prolonged QT interval and relatively low serum potassium. French marketing experience has reported over one hundred verified cases of torsades de pointes. While this number, based on total use, represents a rate of only 0.01%, the true rate is undoubtedly much higher, as spontaneous reporting systems all suffer from substantial under reporting.  \nTorsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often but not always associated with a prolonged QT interval, and often drug induced. The relation between the degree of QT prolongation and the development of torsades de pointes is not linear and the likelihood of torsades appears to be increased by hypokalemia, use of potassium wasting diuretics, and the presence of antecedent bradycardia. While the safe upper limit of QT is not defined, it is suggested that the interval not be permitted to exceed 0.52 seconds during treatment. If dose reduction does not eliminate the excessive prolongation, VASCOR (bepridil)  should be stopped.  \nBecause most domestic and foreign cases of torsades have developed in patients with hypokalemia, usually related to diuretic use or significant liver disease, if concomitant diuretics are needed, low doses and addition or primary use of a potassium sparing diuretic should be considered and serum potassium should be monitored.  \nVASCOR (bepridil)  has been associated with the usual range of pro-arrhythmic effects characteristic of Class 1 anti-arrhythmics (increased premature ventricular contraction rates, new sustained VT, and VT/VF that is more resistant to sinus rhythm conversion). Use in patients with severe arrhythmias (who are most susceptible to certain pro-arrhythmic effects) has been limited, so that risk in these patients is not defined.  \nIn the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long-term, multi-centered, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had myocardial infarctions more than six days but less than two years previously, an excess mortality/non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in patients treated with encainide or flecainide (56/730) compared with that seen in patients assigned to matched placebo-treated groups (22/725). The applicability of these results to other populations (e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) or to other anti-arrhythmic drugs is uncertain, but at present it is prudent to consider any drug documented to provoke new serious arrhythmias or worsening of pre-existing arrhythmias as having a similar risk and to avoid their use in the post-infarction period.",

Local reactions after initial insertion of a single implant included bruising\n  (34.6%) and burning (5.6%). Other, less frequently reported, reactions included\n  pulling, pressure, itching, erythema, pain, edema, and bleeding. In these two clinical trials, four patients had local infection/inflammations\n  that resolved after treatment with oral antibiotics.

The risk of transmission of recognized blood-borne viruses has been reduced\n  by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing\n  for the presence of certain current viral infections, and by implementing process\n  steps for the inactivation and/or removal of certain potential viruses during\n  manufacturing. Despite these measures, some as yet unrecognized blood-borne\n  viruses may not be removed by the manufacturing process; therefore VIGIV (vaccinia immune globulin intravenous) , like\n  any other blood product, should be given only if a benefit is expected (see\n  PRECAUTIONS – General).",
