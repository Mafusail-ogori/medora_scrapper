Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of naloxone hydrochloride in the post-operative setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in post-operative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Other events that have been reported in post-marketing use of naloxone hydrochloride include agitation, disorientation, confusion, and anger. Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were opioid dependent resulted in opioid withdrawal characterized by rapid onset of severe body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, sweating, yawning, nausea, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness and increased blood pressure. In some patients, aggressive behavior has occurred in the context of abrupt reversal of an opioid overdose.

Most reactions have been of a\nhypersensitivity nature and have consisted of erythema, swelling, induration \nand/or urticaria at implantation sites. Often these reactions have occurred following an\nunrecognized or unreported positive collagen skin test. Most of the remaining\nresponses occurred in patients who became sensitized to ZYDERM collagen implant\nat some point during their course of treatment. Approximately 80% of these\nreactions occur within four weeks following the sensitizing dose. Typically, allergic reactions persist between one and\nnine months, with an average duration of four months. These reactions may be\nintermittent or continuous in nature. In rare instances, reactions have\nresolved in one or two weeks or have persisted for more than one year. Although\nseveral forms of therapy (antihistamines; oral, topical and intralesional\nsteroids) have been tried, they usually resulted in only temporary improvement.\nIn most cases, time has proved to be the determining factor in the resolution\nof these reactions. In rare instances, patients have been left with residual \nfirmness at the site of a resolved adverse reaction. On rare occasions, the hypersensitivity response has\nprogressed to a cystic reaction which may drain purulent material. The\nincidence and severity of this type of hypersensitivity response reported to\ndate has been greater with ZYPLAST collagen implant than with ZYDERM collagen implant.\nThese reactions develop weeks to months following injection and may result in\nscar formation, rarely requiring medical revision to correct. This type of\nreaction can occur as multiple and/or recurrent sterile abscesses which tend to\nbe persistent and resistant to drug therapy; careful incision and drainage has\nbeen a useful treatment. Infections at implantation sites have occurred in fewer\nthan one per thousand treated patients, and herpes simplex eruptions at sites\nwhich had been previously affected with herpes simplex have been reported in\nfewer than one per ten thousand patients. These responses resolved quickly and\nwithout sequelae. Systemic complaints have been reported by fewer than 0.5%\nof collagen implant patients. During clinical testing and subsequent monitoring\nof patient complaints following exposure to ZYDERM collagen implant, a variety\nof systemic complaints have been reported. These reports have included flu-like\nsymptoms (fever, myalgia, neuralgia, headache, nausea, malaise, or dizziness);\npruritis; rash; transient visual disturbances including blurred vision;\ntingling and numbness; transient polyarthralgia; and various systemic diseases\nincluding immune-mediated diseases. Rare anaphylactoid responses have been\nreported with ZYDERM collagen implant, including acute episodes of hypotension,\ndifficulty in breathing, tightness in chest, and/or shortness of breath. As with any injection into the head or neck, the injected\nmaterial may be inadvertently implanted in a blood vessel. Localized necrosis \nand/or sloughing, which may result in a scar, has occurred following\ninterruption of blood flow through blood vessel laceration or occlusion, or through\ntissue overdistention which compromised vascularity. The extent of necrosis has\nvaried and has been reported more frequently in the glabellar region of the\nface than in other areas; nevertheless, the incidence is less than 1% of\ntreated patients. Scar formation may also occur in conjunction with either infection\nand/or hypersensitivity responses. If implantation is followed by prolonged\nblanching or significant ecchymosis at the treatment site, gentle massage and\nclose follow-up are recommended.",
    "warnings": "A test implantation must be administered and evaluated\nprior to soft tissue deficiency correction with ZYDERM collagen implant (see Directions\nfor Use for further details). If the test implantation response is\npositive, the patient must not be treated with ZYDERM collagen implant. If the\ntest implantation response is equivocal, it is recommended that a second test\nimplantation be administered in the opposite arm and evaluated prior to the\ninitiation of treatment.",
