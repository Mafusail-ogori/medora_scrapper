      "Overview": "Back pain is one of the most common reasons people seek medical help or miss work. • Back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide. • Fortunately, measures can help prevent or relieve most back pain episodes, especially for people younger than age 60. • If prevention fails, simple home treatment and using the body correctly often can heal the back within a few weeks. • Surgery is rarely needed to treat back pain.",
      "Symptoms": "Back pain can range from a muscle ache to a shooting, burning or stabbing feeling. • Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. • Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make pain worse. • Most back pain improves over time with home treatment and self-care, often within a few weeks. • Contact your healthcare professional for back pain that: Lasts longer than a few weeks. • Is severe and doesn't improve with rest. • Spreads down one or both legs, especially if it goes below the knee. • Causes weakness, numbness, or tingling in one or both legs. • Is paired with unexplained weight loss. • In some people, back pain can signal a serious medical problem. • This is rare, but seek immediate care for back pain that: Causes new bowel or bladder problems. • Is accompanied by a fever. • Follows a fall, blow to the back or other injury. • Back pain often develops without a cause that shows up in a test or an imaging study. • Conditions commonly linked to back pain include: Muscle or ligament strain. • Repeated heavy lifting or a sudden awkward movement can strain back muscles and spinal ligaments. • For people in poor physical condition, constant strain on the back can cause painful muscle spasms. • Bulging or ruptured disks. • Disks act as cushions between the bones in the spine. • The soft material inside a disk can bulge or rupture and press on a nerve. • However, a bulging or ruptured disk might not cause back pain. • Disk disease is often found on spine X-rays, CT scans or MRIs done for another reason. • Arthritis. • Osteoarthritis can affect the lower back. • In some cases, arthritis in the spine can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, a condition called spinal stenosis. • Osteoporosis. • The spine's vertebrae can develop painful breaks if the bones become porous and brittle. • Ankylosing spondylitis, also called axial spondyloarthritis. • This inflammatory disease can cause some of the bones in the spine to fuse. • This makes the spine less flexible. • Anyone can develop back pain, even children and teens. • These factors can increase the risk of developing back pain: Age. • Back pain is more common with age, starting around age 30 or 40. • Lack of exercise. • Weak, unused muscles in the back and abdomen might lead to back pain. • Excess weight. • Excess body weight puts extra stress on the back. • Diseases. • Some types of arthritis and cancer can contribute to back pain. • Improper lifting. • Using the back instead of the legs can lead to back pain. • Psychological conditions. • People prone to depression and anxiety appear to have a greater risk of back pain. • Stress can cause muscle tension, which can contribute to back pain. • Smoking. • People who smoke have increased rates of back pain. • This may occur because smoking causes coughing, which can lead to herniated disks. • Smoking also can decrease blood flow to the spine and increase the risk of osteoporosis. • Improving one's physical condition and learning and practicing how to use the body might help prevent back pain. • To keep the back healthy and strong: Exercise. • Regular low-impact aerobic activities can increase strength and endurance in the back and allow the muscles to work better. • Walking, bicycling and swimming are good choices because they don't strain or jolt the back. • Talk with your healthcare team about which activities to try. • Build muscle strength and flexibility. • Abdominal and back muscle exercises, which strengthen the body's core, help condition these muscles so that they work together to support the back. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight strains back muscles. • Quit smoking. • Smoking increases the risk of low back pain. • The risk rises with the number of cigarettes smoked each day, so quitting can help reduce this risk. • Avoid movements that twist or strain the back. • To use the body properly: Stand smart. • Don't slouch. • Maintain a neutral pelvic position. • When standing for long periods, place one foot on a low footstool to take some of the load off the lower back. • Alternate feet. • Good posture can reduce the stress on back muscles. • Sit smart. • Choose a seat with good lower back support, armrests and a swivel base. • Placing a pillow or rolled towel in the small of the back can maintain its typical curve. • Keep knees and hips level. • Change position frequently, at least every half hour. • Lift smart. • Avoid heavy lifting, if possible. • If you must lift something heavy, let your legs do the work. • Keep your back straight, bend only at the knees, and don't twist. • Hold the load close to your body. • Find a lifting partner if the object is heavy or awkward. • Because back pain is common, many products promise prevention or relief. • But there's no good evidence that special shoes, shoe inserts, back supports or specially designed furniture can help. • In addition, there doesn't appear to be one type of mattress that's best for people with back pain. • It's probably a matter of what feels most comfortable to each person. • Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. • See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.",

      "Overview": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can cause discomfort and pain of the vagina. • It happens when natural bacteria levels are out of balance. • Balanced levels of bacteria help keep the vagina healthy. • But when too much of some bacteria grow, it can lead to BV. • Bacterial vaginosis can happen at any age. • But it's most common during the reproductive years. • The changes in hormones during this time make it easier for certain kinds of bacteria to grow. • Also, bacterial vaginosis is more common among those who are sexually active. • It's not clear why this is. • But activities such as unprotected sex and douching raise your risk of having BV.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include: Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green. • Foul-smelling, \"fishy\" vaginal odor. • Vaginal itching. • Burning during urination. • Many people with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms. • Make an appointment to see a health care professional if: Your vaginal discharge smells unusual and you have discomfort. • Your doctor can help find the cause of your symptoms. • You've had vaginal infections before but your discharge seems different this time. • You have a new sex partner or different sex partners. • Sometimes, the symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) are the same as those of bacterial vaginosis. • You thought you had a yeast infection but still have symptoms after self-treatment. • Bacterial vaginosis happens when the vagina's natural bacteria levels are out of balance. • The bacteria in the vagina are called the vaginal flora. • Balanced vaginal flora help keep the vagina healthy. • Usually \"good\" bacteria outnumber \"bad\" bacteria. • The good bacteria are called lactobacilli; the bad bacteria are anaerobes. • When there are too many anaerobes, they upset the balance of the flora, causing bacterial vaginosis. • Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include: Having different sex partners or a new sex partner. • The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn't clear. • But BV happens more often when someone has different or new sex partners. • Also, BV is more common when the sex of both partners is female. • Douching. • The vagina is self-cleaning. • So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn't needed. • It may even cause problems. • Douching upsets the vagina's healthy balance of bacteria. • It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis. • Natural lack of lactobacilli bacteria. • If your vagina doesn't produce enough lactobacilli, you're more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis. • Bacterial vaginosis doesn't cause complications very often. • But sometimes, having BV may lead to: Sexually transmitted infections. • If you have BV, you have a higher risk of getting an STI. • STIs include HIV, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia or gonorrhea. • If you have HIV, bacterial vaginosis raises the risk of passing the virus to your partner. • Infection risk after gynecological surgery. • Having BV may increase the risk of developing an infection after surgery such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage (D&C). • Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). • Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause PID. • This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility. • Pregnancy issues. • Past studies have shown a possible link between BV and problems with pregnancy. • These include preterm birth and low birth weight. • New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons. • These reasons include having a history of early delivery. • But the studies agree that you should be tested if you notice symptoms of BV while pregnant. • If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you. • To help prevent bacterial vaginosis: Don't use scented products. • Wash your genitals with warm water only. • Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues. • Use unscented tampons or pads only. • Don't douche. • Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection. • It may even make it worse. • Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than normal bathing. • Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection. • Practice safe sex. • To lower your risk of STIs, use latex condoms or dental dams. • Clean any sex toys. • Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex.",

      "Overview": "Balance problems can make you feel dizzy, as if the room is spinning, unsteady, or lightheaded. • You might feel as if the room is spinning or you're going to fall down. • These feelings can happen whether you're lying down, sitting or standing. • Many body systems — including your muscles, bones, joints, eyes, the balance organ in the inner ear, nerves, heart and blood vessels — must work normally for you to have normal balance. • When these systems aren't functioning well, you can experience balance problems. • Many medical conditions can cause balance problems. • However, most balance problems result from issues in your balance organ in the inner ear (vestibular system).",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of balance problems include: Sense of motion or spinning (vertigo) Feeling of faintness or lightheadedness (presyncope) Loss of balance or unsteadiness Falling or feeling like you might fall Feeling a floating sensation or dizziness Vision changes, such as blurriness Confusion Balance problems can be caused by several different conditions. • The cause of balance problems is usually related to the specific sign or symptom. • Vertigo can be associated with many conditions, including: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). • BPPV occurs when calcium crystals in your inner ear — which help control your balance — are dislodged from their normal positions and move elsewhere in the inner ear. • BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in adults. • You might experience a spinning sensation when turning in bed or tilting your head back to look up. • Vestibular neuritis. • This inflammatory disorder, probably caused by a virus, can affect the nerves in the balance portion of your inner ear. • Symptoms are often severe and persistent, and include nausea and difficulty walking. • Symptoms can last several days and gradually improve without treatment. • This is a common disorder second to BPPV in adults. • Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness. • This disorder occurs frequently with other types of vertigo. • Symptoms include unsteadiness or a sensation of motion in your head. • Symptoms often worsen when you watch objects move, when you read or when you are in a visually complex environment such as a shopping mall. • This is the third most common disorder in adults. • Meniere's disease. • In addition to sudden and severe vertigo, Meniere's disease can cause fluctuating hearing loss and buzzing, ringing or a feeling of fullness in your ear. • The cause of Meniere's disease isn't fully known. • Meniere's disease is rare and typically develops in people who are between the ages of 20 and 40. • Migraine. • Dizziness and sensitivity to motion (vestibular migraine) can occur due to migraine. • Migraine is a common cause of dizziness. • Acoustic neuroma. • This noncancerous (benign), slow-growing tumor develops on a nerve that affects your hearing and balance. • You might experience dizziness or loss of balance, but the most common symptoms are hearing loss and ringing in your ear. • Acoustic neuroma is a rare condition. • Ramsay Hunt syndrome. • Also known as herpes zoster oticus, this condition occurs when a shingles-like infection affects the facial, auditory and vestibular nerves near one of your ears. • You might experience vertigo, ear pain, facial weakness and hearing loss. • Head injury. • You might experience vertigo due to a concussion or other head injury. • Motion sickness. • You might experience dizziness in boats, cars and airplanes, or on amusement park rides. • Motion sickness is common in people with migraines. • Lightheadedness can be associated with: Hemodynamic orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension). • Standing or sitting up too quickly can cause some people to experience a significant drop in their blood pressure, resulting in feeling lightheaded or faint. • Cardiovascular disease. • Abnormal heart rhythms (heart arrhythmia), narrowed or blocked blood vessels, a thickened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), or a decrease in blood volume can reduce blood flow and cause lightheadedness or a fainting feeling. • Losing your balance while walking, or feeling imbalanced, can result from: Vestibular problems. • Abnormalities in your inner ear can cause a sensation of a floating or heavy head and unsteadiness in the dark. • Nerve damage to your legs (peripheral neuropathy). • The damage can lead to difficulties with walking. • Joint, muscle or vision problems. • Muscle weakness and unstable joints can contribute to your loss of balance. • Difficulties with eyesight also can lead to unsteadiness. • Medications. • Loss of balance or unsteadiness can be a side effect of medications. • Certain neurological conditions. • These include cervical spondylosis and Parkinson's disease. • A sense of dizziness or lightheadedness can result from: Inner ear problems. • Abnormalities of the vestibular system can lead to a sensation of floating or other false sensation of motion. • Psychiatric disorders. • Depression (major depressive disorder), anxiety and other psychiatric disorders can cause dizziness. • Abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation). • This condition often accompanies anxiety disorders and may cause lightheadedness. • Medications. • Lightheadedness can be a side effect of medications.",

      "Overview": "Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red. • Between the esophagus and the stomach is a critically important valve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). • Over time, the LES may begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). • GERD is often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. • In some people, this GERD may trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus. • Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. • Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). • If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.",
      "Symptoms": "The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standing GERD, which may include these signs and symptoms: Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents Difficulty swallowing food Less commonly, chest pain Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux. • So, you should discuss your digestive health with your doctor regarding the possibility of Barrett's esophagus. • If you've had trouble with heartburn, regurgitation and acid reflux for more than five years, then you should ask your doctor about your risk of Barrett's esophagus. • Seek immediate help if you: Have chest pain, which may be a symptom of a heart attack Have difficulty swallowing Are vomiting red blood or blood that looks like coffee grounds Are passing black, tarry or bloody stools Are unintentionally losing weight The exact cause of Barrett's esophagus isn't known. • While many people with Barrett's esophagus have long-standing GERD, many have no reflux symptoms, a condition often called \"silent reflux.\" Whether this acid reflux is accompanied by GERD symptoms or not, stomach acid and chemicals wash back into the esophagus, damaging esophagus tissue and triggering changes to the lining of the swallowing tube, causing Barrett's esophagus. • Factors that increase your risk of Barrett's esophagus include: Family history. • Your odds of having Barrett's esophagus increase if you have a family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. • Being male. • Men are far more likely to develop Barrett's esophagus. • Being white. • White people have a greater risk of the disease than do people of other races. • Age. • Barrett's esophagus can occur at any age but is more common in adults over 50. • Chronic heartburn and acid reflux. • Having GERD that doesn't get better when taking medications known as proton pump inhibitors or having GERD that requires regular medication can increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus. • Current or past smoking. • Being overweight. • Body fat around your abdomen further increases your risk. • People with Barrett's esophagus have an increased risk of esophageal cancer. • The risk is small, even in people who have precancerous changes in their esophagus cells. • Fortunately, most people with Barrett's esophagus will never develop esophageal cancer.",

      "Overview": "Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown blood-sucking, wingless insects. • Bedbug bites usually clear up without treatment in a week or two. • Bedbugs aren't known to spread disease, but they can cause an allergic reaction or a severe skin reaction in some people. • Bedbugs are about the size of an apple seed. • They hide in the cracks and crevices of beds, box springs, headboards, bed frames and other objects around a bed and come out at night to feed on their preferred host, humans. • The risk of running into bedbugs is higher if you spend time in places where nighttime guests come and go often — such as hotels, hospitals or homeless shelters. • If you have bedbugs in your home, professional extermination is recommended.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of bedbug bites are similar to symptoms of other insect bites and rashes. • Bedbug bites are usually: Inflamed spots, often with a darker spot in the middle Itchy Arranged in a rough line or in a cluster Located on the face, neck, arms and hands Some people have no reaction to bedbug bites, while others experience an allergic reaction that can include severe itching, blisters or hives. • If you experience allergic reactions or severe skin reactions to bedbug bites, see your health care provider for professional treatment. • Bedbug infestations may be linked to: More frequent travel Changes in pest control practices Insecticide resistance Bedbug infestations usually occur around or near where people sleep. • They can be found in: Clothing Luggage Bedding Boxes Box springs Mattresses Headboards Objects near beds They can also be found: Under peeling paint and loose wallpaper Under carpeting near baseboards In upholstered furniture seams Under light switch plates or electrical outlets Bedbugs can move from one site to another by traveling on items such as clothing, luggage, furniture, boxes and bedding. • Bedbugs can easily travel between floors and rooms in hotels or apartment buildings. • Bedbugs don't care if their environment is clean or dirty. • All they need is a warm host and plenty of hiding places. • You're at risk of bites from bedbugs if you're in places where people come and go often, such as apartment buildings, dorm rooms, homeless shelters, hotels, cruise ships, trains, buses and refugee camps. • Cover up. • Bedbugs don't tend to burrow under clothing. • So you may be able to avoid bites by wearing pajamas that cover as much skin as possible. • Inspect secondhand items. • Look over used bedding, mattresses and upholstered furniture before bringing them into your home. • Use hotel precautions. • Check mattress seams for bedbug excrement and place your luggage on tables or dressers instead of on the floor.",

      "Overview": "Bedsores are injuries to the skin and the tissue below the skin that are due to pressure on the skin for a long time. • Bedsores most often arise on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as the heels, ankles, hips and tailbone. • Bedsores also are called pressure ulcers, pressure injuries and decubitus ulcers. • The people who are most at risk of bedsores have medical conditions that keep them from changing positions or moving. • Or they spend most of their time in a bed or a chair. • Bedsores can arise over hours or days. • Most sores heal with treatment, but some never heal completely. • You can take steps to put a stop to bedsores and help them heal.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of bedsores are: Changes in skin color or texture. • Swelling. • Pus-like draining. • An area of skin that feels cooler or warmer to the touch than other areas. • Sore areas. • Bedsores fall into one of several stages based on their depth, how serious they are and other features. • The degree of skin and tissue damage ranges from inflamed, unbroken skin to a deep injury involving muscle and bone. • For people who use wheelchairs, bedsores often occur on skin over these areas: Tailbone or buttocks. • Shoulder blades and spine. • Backs of arms and legs where they rest against a chair. • For people who need to stay in bed, bedsores may happen on the: Back or sides of the head. • Shoulder blades. • Hip, lower back or tailbone. • Heels, ankles and skin behind the knees. • If you notice warning signs of a bedsore, change your position to ease pressure on the area. • If the area doesn't improve in 24 to 48 hours, contact your healthcare professional. • Seek medical care right away if you notice signs of infection. • These include fever, drainage from a sore or a sore that smells bad, as well as warmth or swelling around a sore. • Pressure against the skin that limits blood flow to the skin causes bedsores. • Limited movement can make skin prone to damage and cause bedsores. • The three main things that lead to bedsores are: Pressure. • Constant pressure on any part of the body can lessen the blood flow to tissues. • Blood flow is essential to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to tissues. • Without these key nutrients, skin and nearby tissues are damaged and might die over time. • Limited movement can make skin prone to the damage that the pressure causes. • For people with limited mobility, pressure tends to happen in areas that aren't well padded with muscle or fat and that lie over a bone. • These areas include the spine, tailbone, shoulder blades, hips, heels and elbows. • Friction. • Friction occurs when the skin rubs against clothing or bedding. • It can make fragile skin more vulnerable to injury, especially if the skin also is moist. • Shear. • Shear occurs when two surfaces move in the opposite direction. • For example, when a bed is raised at the head, a person can slide down in bed. • As the tailbone moves down, the skin over the bone might stay in place, pulling in the opposite direction. • Your risk of getting bedsores is higher if you have a hard time moving and can't change position easily while seated or in bed. • Risk factors include: Immobility. • This might be due to poor health, spinal cord injury or another cause. • Incontinence. • Skin becomes more vulnerable with extended exposure to urine and stool. • Lack of sensory perception. • Spinal cord injuries, neurological disorders and other conditions can make you lose sensation. • If you can't feel pain or discomfort, you won't be aware of warning signs and the need to change position. • Poor nutrition and hydration. • People need enough fluids, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals every day to maintain healthy skin and stop the breakdown of tissues. • Medical conditions affecting blood flow. • Health problems that can affect blood flow can raise the risk of tissue damage such as bedsores. • Examples of these types of medical conditions are diabetes and vascular disease. • Age. • If you're over 70, you're more likely to be affected by bedsores. • Complications of pressure ulcers include: Cellulitis. • Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and connected soft tissues. • It can cause warmth and swelling of the affected area. • The skin may change color or look inflamed. • People with nerve damage often don't feel pain in the area cellulitis affects. • Bone and joint infections. • An infection from a bedsore can burrow into joints and bones. • Joint infections, such as septic arthritis, can damage cartilage and tissue. • Bone infections, also known as osteomyelitis, can reduce the function of joints and limbs. • Cancer. • A Marjolin ulcer is a long-term, nonhealing wound that can become a type of squamous cell carcinoma. • Sepsis. • Rarely, a skin ulcer leads to sepsis, which is a life-threatening complication of an infection. • Some complications can be life-threatening. • You can help stop bedsores with these steps: Frequently change your position to avoid stress on the skin. • Take good care of your skin. • Eat and drink regularly. • Quit smoking. • Manage stress. • Exercise daily. • Consider these recommendations related to changing position in a bed or chair: Shift your weight frequently. • Ask for help with changing your position every two hours. • Lift yourself, if possible. • If you have enough upper body strength, do wheelchair pushups. • Raise your body off the seat by pushing on the arms of the chair. • Look into a specialty wheelchair. • Some wheelchairs allow you to tilt them, which can relieve pressure. • Select cushions or a mattress that relieves pressure. • Use cushions or a special mattress to relieve pressure and help make sure that your body is well positioned. • Do not use doughnut cushions. • They can focus pressure on surrounding tissue. • Adjust the height of your bed. • If possible, do not raise the head of the bed above 30 degrees. • This helps prevent shearing. • Consider these suggestions for skin care: Keep skin clean and dry. • Wash the skin with a gentle cleanser and pat dry. • Do this cleansing routine regularly to limit the skin's exposure to moisture, urine and stool. • Protect the skin. • Use moisture barrier creams to protect the skin from urine and stool. • Change bedding and clothing frequently if needed. • Watch for buttons on the clothing and wrinkles in the bedding that can irritate your skin. • Inspect the skin daily. • Look closely at your skin daily for warning signs of a bedsore.",

      "Overview": "Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis — means passing urine without intending to while asleep. • This happens after the age at which staying dry at night can be reasonably expected. • Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar scene in many homes. • But don't get upset if your child wets the bed. • Bed-wetting isn't a sign of problems with toilet training. • It's often just a typical part of a child's development. • Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. • At this age, your child may still be developing nighttime bladder control. • If your child continues to wet the bed, treat the problem with patience and understanding. • Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms and sometimes medicine may help lessen bed-wetting.",
      "Symptoms": "Most kids are fully toilet trained by age 5, but there's really no target date for having complete bladder control. • Between the ages of 5 and 7, bed-wetting remains a problem for some children. • After 7 years of age, a small number of children still wet the bed. • Most children outgrow bed-wetting on their own — but some need a little help. • In other cases, bed-wetting may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs medical attention. • Talk to your child's doctor or other health care professional if: Your child still wets the bed after age 7. • Your child starts to wet the bed after a few months of being dry at night. • In addition to wetting the bed, your child has pain when passing urine, is often extra thirsty, has pink or red urine, has hard stools, or snores. • It's not known for sure what causes bed-wetting. • Several issues may play a role, such as: A small bladder. • Your child's bladder may not be developed enough to hold all the urine made during the night. • No awareness of a full bladder. • If the nerves that control the bladder are slow to mature, a full bladder may not wake your child. • This may be especially true if your child is a deep sleeper. • A hormone imbalance. • During childhood, some kids do not produce enough anti-diuretic hormone, also called ADH. • ADH slows down how much urine is made during the night. • Urinary tract infection. • Also called a UTI, this infection can make it hard for your child to control the urge to pass urine. • Symptoms may include bed-wetting, daytime accidents, passing urine often, red or pink urine, and pain when passing urine. • Sleep apnea. • Sometimes bed-wetting is a sign of obstructive sleep apnea. • Sleep apnea is when a child's breathing is interrupted during sleep. • This is often due to swollen and irritated or enlarged tonsils or adenoids. • Other symptoms may include snoring and being sleepy during the day. • Diabetes. • For a child who's usually dry at night, bed-wetting may be the first sign of diabetes. • Other symptoms may include passing large amounts of urine at once, increased thirst, extreme tiredness and weight loss in spite of a good appetite. • Ongoing constipation. • A child who is constipated does not have bowel movements often enough, and the stools may be hard and dry. • When constipation is long term, the muscles involved in passing urine and stools may not work well. • This can be linked to bed-wetting. • A problem in the urinary tract or nervous system. • Rarely, bed-wetting is related to a difference in the structure of the urinary tract or nervous system. • Bed-wetting can affect anyone, but it's twice as common in boys as in girls. • Several factors have been linked with an increased risk of bed-wetting, including: Stress and anxiety. • Stressful events may trigger bed-wetting. • Examples include having a new baby in the family, starting a new school or sleeping away from home. • Family history. • If one or both of a child's parents wet the bed as children, their child has an increased chance of wetting the bed, too. • Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). • Bed-wetting is more common in children who have ADHD. • Although frustrating, bed-wetting without a physical cause does not result in any health risks. • But bed-wetting can create some issues for your child, including: Guilt and embarrassment, which can lead to low self-esteem. • Loss of opportunities for social activities, such as sleepovers and camp. • Rashes on your child's bottom and genital area — especially if your child sleeps in wet underwear.",

      "Overview": "A bee sting is a common outdoor nuisance. • You can take several steps to avoid stings from bees, hornets and wasps. • If you're stung, basic first aid can help ease the pain of a mild or moderate reaction. • You may need emergency medical help for a severe reaction.",
      "Symptoms": "Bee sting symptoms can range from pain and swelling to a life-threatening allergic reaction. • Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will be more severe. • Mild reaction. • Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include instant, sharp burning pain, a welt and swelling. • In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. • Moderate reaction. • Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a stronger reaction, with burning pain, a welt, itching, flushing and swelling that gets worse over the next day or two. • The symptoms can last up to seven days. • Severe reaction. • A severe reaction to a bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. • This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis. • A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect develop anaphylaxis. • It usually happens 15 minutes to an hour after the sting. • Symptoms include rash, itching, trouble breathing, swollen tongue, trouble swallowing and tightness in the chest. • Multiple bee stings. • If you get stung more than a dozen times, you can have a bad reaction that makes you feel quite sick. • Symptoms include those of a moderate reaction as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and lightheadedness. • Call 911 or seek immediate care for: A severe reaction to a bee sting that suggests anaphylaxis, even if it's just one or two symptoms. • If you were prescribed emergency epinephrine that you inject yourself (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others), use it right away as your healthcare professional directed. • Inject the epinephrine first, then call 911. • Multiple stings in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems. • Make an appointment to see a healthcare professional if: Bee sting symptoms don't go away within three days. • You've had other symptoms of an allergic response to a bee sting. • A bee sting is an injury caused by bee venom. • To sting, a bee jabs a barbed stinger into the skin. • The stinger releases venom. • The venom has proteins in it that cause pain and swelling around the sting area. • Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. • In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. • Some types of bees tend to swarm, stinging in a group. • An example of this type of bee is Africanized bees. • Risk factors for a bee sting include: Living in an area where bees are active. • Being near beehives. • Spending a lot of time outdoors. • The following tips may help reduce your risk of a bee sting: Take care when drinking sweet beverages outside. • Use wide, open cups so you can see if a bee is in them. • Inspect cans and straws before drinking from them. • Tightly cover food containers and trash cans, as odors from them can attract insects. • Clear away garbage, fallen fruit, and dog or other animal feces, as flies can attract wasps. • Wear closed-toe shoes when walking outside. • Don't walk through flowers. • Don't use perfumes and scented hair and body products, as they can attract insects. • Don't wear bright colors or floral prints, as they can attract bees. • Be careful when mowing the lawn or trimming vegetation. • Such activities might disturb insects in a beehive or wasp nest. • Avoid being near bees, yellow jackets and hornets. • For example, remove hives and nests near your home if you can do this safely. • Know what to do when bees or other stinging insects are nearby: If a few bees are flying around you, stay calm and slowly walk away from the area. • Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting. • If a bee or wasp stings you, or many insects start to fly around, cover your mouth and nose and quickly leave the area. • When a bee stings, it releases a chemical that attracts other bees. • If you can, get into a building or closed vehicle. • People who have a severe reaction to a bee sting have on average a 50% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. • Talk to a healthcare professional about prevention measures such as allergy shots to avoid a similar reaction if you get stung again.",

      "Overview": "Behcet's (beh-CHETS) disease, also called Behcet's syndrome, is a rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation throughout your body. • The disease can lead to numerous signs and symptoms that can seem unrelated at first. • They can include mouth sores, eye inflammation, skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores. • Treatment involves medications to reduce the signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease and to prevent serious complications, such as blindness.",
      "Symptoms": "Behcet's disease symptoms vary from person to person, can come and go or become less severe over time. • Signs and symptoms depend on which parts of your body are affected. • Areas commonly affected by Behcet's disease include: Mouth. • Painful mouth sores that look similar to canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet's disease. • They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers. • The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur. • Skin. • Some people develop acnelike sores on their bodies. • Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs. • Genitals. • Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. • The sores are usually painful and can leave scars. • Eyes. • Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. • In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go. • Joints. • Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. • The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. • Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own. • Blood vessels. • Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. • Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel. • Digestive system. • A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding. • Brain. • Inflammation in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance or stroke. • Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice unusual signs and symptoms that might indicate Behcet's disease. • If you've been diagnosed with the condition, see your doctor if you notice new signs and symptoms. • Behcet's disease might be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy cells. • It's likely that genetic and environmental factors play a role. • The signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease are considered to be due to inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). • The condition can involve arteries and veins of all sizes, damaging them throughout the body. • Several genes have been found to be associated with the disease. • Some researchers believe a virus or bacterium can trigger Behcet's disease in people who have certain genes that make them susceptible to Behcet's. • Factors that might increase your risk of Behcet's include: Age. • Behcet's disease commonly affects men and women in their 20s and 30s, though children and older adults also can develop the condition. • Where you live. • People from countries in the Middle East and East Asia, including Turkey, Iran, Japan and China, are more likely to develop Behcet's. • Sex. • While Behcet's disease occurs in both men and women, the disease is usually more severe in men. • Genes. • Having certain genes is associated with a higher risk of developing Behcet's. • Complications of Behcet's disease depend on your signs and symptoms. • For instance, untreated uveitis can lead to decreased vision or blindness. • People with eye signs and symptoms of Behcet's disease need to visit an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) regularly because treatment can help prevent this complication.",

      "Overview": "Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. • Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. • The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. • Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close. • Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. • It can occur at any age. • The exact cause is not known. • Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. • Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. • Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. • A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. • Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days. • Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling. • Drooling. • Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side. • Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side. • Headache. • Loss of taste. • Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced. • Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face. • Seek medical help right away if you experience any type of paralysis because you may be having a stroke. • Bell's palsy is not caused by a stroke, but the symptoms of both conditions are similar. • If you have facial weakness or drooping, see your healthcare professional to find out the cause and the severity of the illness. • Although the exact reason Bell's palsy occurs isn't clear, it's often related to having a viral infection. • Viruses that have been linked to Bell's palsy include viruses that cause: Cold sores and genital herpes, also known as herpes simplex. • Chickenpox and shingles, also known as herpes zoster. • Infectious mononucleosis, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. • Cytomegalovirus infections. • Respiratory illnesses, caused by adenoviruses. • German measles, also known as rubella. • Mumps, caused by the mumps virus. • Flu, also known as influenza B. • Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, caused by a coxsackievirus. • The nerve that controls facial muscles passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to the face. • In Bell's palsy, that nerve becomes inflamed and swollen — usually related to a viral infection. • Besides affecting facial muscles, the nerve affects tears, saliva, taste and a small bone in the middle of the ear. • Bell's palsy occurs more often in people who: Are pregnant, especially during the third trimester, or who are in the first week after giving birth. • Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold. • Have diabetes. • Have high blood pressure. • Have obesity. • It's rare for Bell's palsy to come back. • But when it does, there's often a family history of repeated attacks. • This suggests that Bell's palsy might have something to do with genes. • Mild symptoms of Bell's palsy typically disappear within a month. • Recovery from more-complete facial paralysis can vary. • Complications may include: Irreversible damage to your facial nerve. • Irregular regrowth of nerve fibers. • This may result in involuntary contraction of certain muscles when you're trying to move other muscles, known as synkinesis. • For example, when you smile, the eye on the affected side may close. • Partial or complete blindness of the eye that won't close. • This is caused by excessive dryness and scratching of the clear protective covering of the eye, known as the cornea.",

      "Overview": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo — the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. • BPPV causes brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness. • It is usually triggered by specific changes in your head's position. • This might occur when you tip your head up or down, when you lie down, or when you turn over or sit up in bed. • Although BPPV can be bothersome, it's rarely serious except when it increases the chance of falls. • You can receive effective treatment for BPPV during a doctor's office visit.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may include: Dizziness A sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving (vertigo) A loss of balance or unsteadiness Nausea Vomiting The signs and symptoms of BPPV can come and go and commonly last less than one minute. • Episodes of BPPV can disappear for some time and then recur. • Activities that bring about the signs and symptoms of BPPV can vary from person to person, but are almost always brought on by a change in head position. • Some people also feel out of balance when standing or walking. • Abnormal rhythmic eye movements usually accompany the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. • Generally, see your doctor if you experience any recurrent, sudden, severe, or prolonged and unexplained dizziness or vertigo. • Although it's uncommon for dizziness to signal a serious illness, see your doctor immediately if you experience dizziness or vertigo along with any of the following: A new, different or severe headache A fever Double vision or loss of vision Hearing loss Trouble speaking Leg or arm weakness Loss of consciousness Falling or difficulty walking Numbness or tingling The signs and symptoms listed above may signal a more serious problem. • Often, there's no known cause for BPPV. • This is called idiopathic BPPV. • When there is a known cause, BPPV is often associated with a minor to severe blow to your head. • Less common causes of BPPV include disorders that damage your inner ear or, rarely, damage that occurs during ear surgery or long periods positioned on your back, such as in a dentist chair. • BPPV also has been associated with migraines. • Inside your ear is a tiny organ called the vestibular labyrinth. • It includes three loop-shaped structures (semicircular canals) that contain fluid and fine, hairlike sensors that monitor your head's rotation. • Other structures (otolith organs) in your ear monitor your head's movements — up and down, right and left, back and forth — and your head's position related to gravity. • These otolith organs contain crystals that make you sensitive to gravity. • For many reasons, these crystals can become dislodged. • When they become dislodged, they can move into one of the semicircular canals — especially while you're lying down. • This causes the semicircular canal to become sensitive to head position changes it would normally not respond to, which is what makes you feel dizzy. • Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo occurs most often in people age 50 and older, but can occur at any age. • BPPV is also more common in women than in men. • A head injury or any other disorder of the balance organs of your ear may make you more susceptible to BPPV. • Although BPPV is uncomfortable, it rarely causes complications. • The dizziness of BPPV can make you unsteady, which may put you at greater risk of falling.",

      "Overview": "Benign peripheral nerve tumors are tumors that form on peripheral nerves. • The peripheral nerves link the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body. • These nerves control muscles that allow you to walk, blink, swallow, pick things up and do other activities. • Benign tumors are not cancerous. • Several different types of tumors may form on the peripheral nerves. • While some are caused by genetics, the cause of these tumors is usually not known. • Although most of these types of tumors are not cancerous, they can cause nerve damage and loss of muscle control. • It's important to see your healthcare professional if you have a lump or if you have pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness. • Peripheral nerve tumors affect nerves by growing within them or by pressing against them. • Peripheral nerve tumors that grow within nerves are called intraneural tumors. • The tumors that press against nerves are called extraneural tumors. • Most peripheral tumors are not cancer. • These are known as benign tumors. • Different types of benign peripheral nerve tumors include: Schwannoma. • A schwannoma is the most common benign peripheral nerve tumor in adults. • These nerve sheath tumors are called schwannomas because they are made up of Schwann cells. • Schwann cells surround the nerves. • These tumors usually grow slowly. • If you develop a schwannoma in an arm or leg, you might notice a mass. • But you might have a schwannoma for years before noticing it. • A schwannoma typically comes from a single bundle of nerve fibers, called a fascicle, within the main nerve. • Some schwannomas grow and form irregular shapes within the spine or pelvis, such as dumbbell tumors. • When a schwannoma grows, more fascicles are at risk when trying to remove the tumor safely. • Schwannomas most commonly occur alone. • Occasionally some people have several of them in the arms, legs or body. • This is a condition called schwannomatosis. • A rare schwannoma near the brainstem, known as an acoustic neuroma, can cause trouble with balance or hearing. • This type of tumor also is known as a vestibular schwannoma. • It sometimes occurs in people with a condition called NF2-related schwannomatosis. • If acoustic neuromas aren't treated and they continue to grow, they can affect nearby nerves and press on the brainstem. • Neurofibroma. • This common type of benign nerve tumor tends to form in the center of a nerve. • A neurofibroma might arise from several nerve bundles and tends to cause mild symptoms. • A neurofibroma most commonly develops in people who have a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow on nerves. • This condition is known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). • Symptoms of NF1 include skin color changes and benign tumors on the skin. • Some people who have NF1 develop other conditions. • These conditions include bone changes, such as a curved spine, and an eye nerve tumor called an optic glioma. • People with NF1 are at risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. • Perineurioma. • This rare benign peripheral nerve tumor arises from perineurial cells, a type of cell that surrounds the peripheral nerve sheath. • A perineurioma can form within a nerve, called an intraneural perineurioma. • It also may form in soft tissue next to a nerve, called an extraneural perineurioma. • An intraneural perineurioma happens most often in children and young adults. • It typically causes gradually progressive weakness in an arm or leg. • Lipoma. • Slow-growing fat cells cause this benign, soft lump that usually appears under the skin on the neck, shoulders, back or arms. • A lipoma near a nerve can squeeze it. • Usually, though, a lipoma causes no pain or other problems. • Your healthcare professional might want to monitor a lipoma through regular checkups. • Ganglion cyst. • Some ganglion cysts come from an injury, but most have no known cause. • They commonly form near joints, such as the wrist, and can cause pain and interfere with everyday activities. • Some go away without treatment, but ganglion cysts that press on or are in nerves need to be treated.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the location of the benign peripheral nerve tumor and the nerves and tissues it affects. • Symptoms may include: Swelling or a lump under your skin. • Pain, tingling or numbness. • Weakness or loss of function in the affected area. • Dizziness or loss of balance. • A benign peripheral nerve tumor can cause symptoms if it presses on the nerve in which it is growing. • It also can press on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. • As a tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms. • But even small tumors can cause symptoms.",
      "Causes": "The cause of benign peripheral nerve tumors usually isn't known. • Some are passed down in families.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors may be different based on the type of benign peripheral nerve tumor. • For neurofibromas, having the genetic condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a risk factor. • NF1 can cause someone to have several neurofibromas. • But most people who have neurofibromas don't have NF1. • People with NF1 are also at increased risk for developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. • It’s important for them to check in often with a health care professional to monitor that risk. • For schwannomas, having the gene that causes schwannomatosis is a risk factor."

      "Overview": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. • It's also called an enlarged prostate. • The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. • It's found just below the bladder. • And it often gets bigger as you get older. • An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. • It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems. • Many treatments can help BPH. • These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. • Your health care provider can help you choose. • The right option depends on things such as: Your symptoms. • The size of your prostate. • Other health problems you might have.",
      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms of BPH include: Frequent or urgent need to pee, also called urination. • Peeing more often at night. • Trouble starting to pee. • Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts. • Dribbling at the end of urination. • Not being able to fully empty the bladder. • Less common symptoms include: Urinary tract infection. • Not being able to pee. • Blood in the urine. • The symptoms of BPH tend to slowly get worse. • But sometimes they stay the same or even improve over time. • The size of the prostate doesn't always determine how serious the symptoms are. • Some people with slightly enlarged prostates can have major symptoms. • Others who have very enlarged prostates can have minor problems. • And some people with enlarged prostates don't have any symptoms at all. • Some other health problems can lead to symptoms that are like those caused by enlarged prostate. • These include: Urinary tract infection. • Inflamed prostate. • Narrowing of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. • Scarring in the bladder neck due to past surgery. • Bladder or kidney stones. • Problems with nerves that control the bladder. • Cancer of the prostate or bladder. • Some medicines also may lead to symptoms that seem like those caused by BPH. • These include: Powerful pain-relieving medicines called opioids. • Cold and allergy medicines. • Older medicines for depression called tricyclic antidepressants. • Talk to your health care provider about your symptoms, even if they don't bother you. • It's important to find out if there are any causes that could be treated. • Without treatment, the risk of a dangerous blockage of the urinary tract can rise. • If you can't pass any urine, get medical help right away. • The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. • The tube that moves urine from the bladder out of the penis is called the urethra. • This tube passes through the center of the prostate. • When the prostate gets bigger, it starts to block urine flow. • The prostate is a gland that typically keeps growing throughout life. • This growth often enlarges the prostate enough to cause symptoms or to block urine flow. • It isn't clear what causes the prostate to get bigger. • It might be due to changes in the balance of sex hormones as you grow older. • Risk factors for an enlarged prostate include: Aging. • An enlarged prostate gland rarely causes symptoms before age 40. • After that, the chance of having an enlarged prostate and related symptoms starts to rise. • Family history. • Having a blood relative with prostate problems makes you more likely to have problems with your prostate. • Diabetes and heart disease. • Studies show that diabetes might raise the risk of BPH. • So might heart disease. • Lifestyle. • Obesity raises the risk of BPH. • Exercise can help lower the risk. • Complications of an enlarged prostate can include: Not being able to pee. • This also is called urinary retention. • You might need to have a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder to drain the urine. • Some people with an enlarged prostate need surgery to get relief. • Urinary tract infections (UTIs). • Not being able to fully empty the bladder can raise the risk of infection in the urinary tract. • If you often get UTIs, you might need surgery to remove part of the prostate. • Bladder stones. • These are most often caused by being unable to fully empty the bladder. • Bladder stones can cause illness, bladder irritation, blood in the urine and blocked urine flow. • Bladder damage. • A bladder that doesn't empty fully can stretch and weaken over time. • As a result, the muscular wall of the bladder no longer squeezes properly to force urine out. • And this makes it harder to fully empty the bladder. • Kidney damage. • Pressure in the bladder from not being able to pee can damage the kidneys or let bladder infections reach the kidneys. • Treatment for BPH lowers the risk of these complications. • But urinary retention and kidney damage can be serious health threats. • Having an enlarged prostate is not thought to raise the risk of getting prostate cancer. • For more information on on benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment at Mayo Clinic, visit the Mayo Clinic Men's Health Center.",

      "Overview": "Binge-eating disorder is a serious condition. • It always involves feeling like you're not able to stop eating. • It also often involves eating much larger than usual amounts of food. • Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal. • But regularly feeling that eating is out of control and eating an unusually large amount of food may be symptoms of binge-eating disorder. • People who have binge-eating disorder often feel embarrassed or ashamed about eating binges. • People with the disorder often go through periods of trying to restrict or severely cut back on their eating as a result. • But this instead may increase urges to eat and lead to a cycle of ongoing binge eating. • Treatment for binge-eating disorder can help people feel more in control and balanced with their eating.",
      "Symptoms": "If you have binge-eating disorder, you may be overweight or obese, or you may be at a healthy weight. • Most people with binge-eating disorder feel upset about their body size or shape no matter what the number on the scale is. • Symptoms of binge-eating disorder vary but can include: Feeling that you don't have control over your eating behavior, for example, you can't stop once you start. • Often eating much larger than usual amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period. • Eating even when you're full or not hungry. • Eating very fast during eating binges. • Eating until you're uncomfortably full. • Often eating alone or in secret. • Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating. • A person with bulimia nervosa, another eating disorder, may binge and then vomit, use laxatives or exercise excessively to get rid of extra calories. • This is not the case with binge-eating disorder. • If you have binge-eating disorder, you may try to diet or eat less food at mealtimes to compensate. • But restricting your diet may simply lead to more binge eating. • How much eating binges affect your mood and ability to function in daily life gives an idea of how serious the condition is for you. • Binge-eating disorder can vary over time. • The condition may be short-lived, may go away and come back, or may continue for years if left untreated. • If you have any symptoms of binge-eating disorder, get medical help as soon as possible. • Talk with your healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your symptoms and feelings. • If you're embarrassed by your eating and are worried about talking to your healthcare professional, start by talking with someone you trust about what you're going through. • A friend, family member, teacher or faith leader can encourage and support you in taking the first steps to successful treatment of binge-eating disorder. • Talking with a professional with specialty training in eating disorders or reaching out to an organization specializing in eating disorders might be a good place to find support from someone who understands what you're going through. • Someone who has binge-eating disorder may become an expert at hiding behavior. • This is usually because of feelings of shame and embarrassment about the symptoms. • Hiding symptoms can make it hard for others to notice the problem. • If you think a loved one may have symptoms of binge-eating disorder, have an open and honest talk about your concerns, but remember to approach the topic with sensitivity. • Eating disorders are mental health conditions, and the behaviors are not the fault or choice of the person with this condition. • Give encouragement and support. • Offer to help your loved one find a healthcare professional or mental health professional with experience in treating eating disorders. • You may help make an appointment. • You might even offer to go along. • The causes of binge-eating disorder are not known. • But certain genes, how your body works, long-term dieting and the presence of other mental health conditions increase your risk. • Binge-eating disorder is more common in women than in men. • People of any age can have binge-eating disorder, but it often begins in the late teens or early 20s. • Factors that can raise your risk of having binge-eating disorder include: Family history. • You're much more likely to have an eating disorder if your parents or siblings have — or had — an eating disorder. • This may point to genes passed down in your family that increase the risk of having an eating disorder. • Dieting. • Many people with binge-eating disorder have a history of dieting. • Dieting or limiting calories throughout the day may trigger an urge to binge eat. • Mental health conditions. • Many people who have binge-eating disorder feel negatively about themselves and their skills and accomplishments. • Triggers for bingeing can include stress, poor body self-image and certain foods. • Certain situations also can be triggers, for example, being at a party, having downtime or driving in your car. • Mental health conditions and physical problems can happen from binge eating. • Complications from binge-eating disorder may include: Not feeling comfortable or able to enjoy your life. • Problems functioning at work, in your personal life or in social situations. • Isolating or feeling isolated from others socially. • Weight gain. • Medical conditions related to weight gain. • These may include joint problems, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), poor nutrition and some sleep-related breathing disorders. • Mental health conditions that are often linked with binge-eating disorder include: Depression. • Anxiety. • Substance use disorders. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior. • If you have a child with binge-eating behaviors: Model body acceptance, regardless of body shape or size. • Make it clear that dieting or restricting food is not healthy unless there's a diagnosed food allergy. • Talk with your child's healthcare professional about any concerns. • The healthcare professional may be in a good position to identify early symptoms of an eating disorder and help get expert treatment right away. • The professional also can recommend helpful resources you can use to support your child.",

      "Overview": "Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings. • These include emotional highs, also known as mania or hypomania, and lows, also known as depression. • Hypomania is less extreme than mania. • When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. • When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania, you may feel very excited and happy (euphoric), full of energy or unusually irritable. • These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. • Episodes of mood swings from depression to mania may occur rarely or multiple times a year. • Each bout usually lasts several days. • Between episodes, some people have long periods of emotional stability. • Others may frequently have mood swings from depression to mania or both depression and mania at the same time. • Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. • In most cases, healthcare professionals use medicines and talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, to treat bipolar disorder.",
      "Symptoms": "There are several types of bipolar and related disorders: Bipolar I disorder. • You've had at least one manic episode that may come before or after hypomanic or major depressive episodes. • In some cases, mania may cause a break from reality. • This is called psychosis. • Bipolar II disorder. • You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. • But you've never had a manic episode. • Cyclothymia. • You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. • These symptoms are less severe than major depression. • Other types. • These types include bipolar and related disorders caused by certain drugs or alcohol, or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. • These types may include mania, or hypomania, which is less extreme than mania, and depression. • Symptoms can cause changes in mood and behavior that can't be predicted. • This can lead to a lot of distress and cause you to have a hard time in life. • Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder. • It's a separate diagnosis. • While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, people with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods of time. • Bipolar disorder can start at any age, but usually it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. • Symptoms can differ from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. • Mania and hypomania are different, but they have the same symptoms. • Mania is more severe than hypomania. • It causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as getting along with others. • Mania also may cause a break from reality, known as psychosis. • You many need to stay in a hospital for treatment. • Manic and hypomanic episodes include three or more of these symptoms: Being much more active, energetic or agitated than usual. • Feeling a distorted sense of well-being or too self-confident. • Needing much less sleep than usual. • Being unusually talkative and talking fast. • Having racing thoughts or jumping quickly from one topic to another. • Being easy to distract. • Making poor decisions. • For example, you may go on buying sprees, take sexual risks or make foolish investments. • A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause you to have a hard time doing day-to-day activities. • These activities include going to work or school, as well as taking part in social activities and getting along with others. • An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: Having a depressed mood. • You may feel sad, empty, hopeless or tearful. • Children and teens who are depressed can seem irritable, angry or hostile. • Having a marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all or most activities. • Losing a lot of weight when not dieting or overeating and gaining weight. • When children don't gain weight as expected, this can be a sign of depression. • Sleeping too little or too much. • Feeling restless or acting slower than usual. • Being very tired or losing energy. • Feeling worthless, feeling too guilty or feeling guilty when it's not necessary. • Having a hard time thinking or concentrating, or not being able to make decisions. • Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide. • Symptoms of bipolar disorders, including depressive episodes, may include other features, such as: Anxious distress, when you're feeling symptoms of anxiety and fear that you're losing control. • Melancholy, when you feel very sad and have a deep loss of pleasure. • Psychosis, when your thoughts or emotions disconnect from reality. • The timing of symptoms may be described as: Mixed, when you have symptoms of depression and mania or hypomania at the same time. • Rapid cycling, when you have four mood episodes in the past year where you switch between mania and hypomania and major depression. • Also, bipolar symptoms may happen when you're pregnant. • Or symptoms can change with the seasons. • Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be hard to identify in children and teens. • It's often hard to tell whether these symptoms are the usual ups and downs or due to stress or trauma, or if they're signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. • Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes. • But the pattern can vary from adults with bipolar disorder. • Moods can shift fast during episodes. • Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. • The most noticeable signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may be severe mood swings that aren't like their usual mood swings. • Despite their mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't know how much being emotionally unstable disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones. • As a result, they don't get the treatment they need. • If you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. • But an emotional crash always follows this euphoria. • This crash can leave you depressed and worn out. • It could cause you to have problems getting along with others. • It also could leave you in financial or legal trouble. • If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your healthcare or mental health professional. • Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. • A mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. • Thoughts about suicide and acting on these thoughts are common for people with bipolar disorder. • If you're thinking about hurting yourself, or if you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or attempting suicide, get help. • You can let a family member or friend know, contact a suicide hotline, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the emergency department. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • While it's not known what causes bipolar disorder, these factors may be involved: Biological differences. • People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. • The importance of these changes is still uncertain, but more research may help identify why these changes happen. • Genetics. • Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. • Researchers are trying to find genes that may cause bipolar disorder. • Factors that may raise the risk of getting bipolar disorder or cause the first episode include: Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder. • Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or another traumatic event. • Drug or alcohol misuse. • Left untreated, bipolar disorder can lead to serious problems that affect every area of your life, including: Problems related to drug and alcohol misuse. • Suicide or suicide attempts. • Legal or financial problems. • Trouble getting along with others. • Poor work or school performance. • Sometimes what seems to be bipolar disorder might really be another disorder. • Or, the symptoms of bipolar disorder might overlap with other disorders, and you also may have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. • Some conditions can make bipolar disorder symptoms worse or make treatment less successful. • Examples include: Anxiety disorders. • Eating disorders. • Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). • Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). • Alcohol or drug misuse. • Borderline personality traits or disorders. • Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid issues, headaches or obesity. • There's no sure way to prevent bipolar disorder. • But getting treated as soon as you notice a mental health disorder can help stop bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions from getting worse. • If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, here are some ways you can stop minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression: Pay attention to warning signs. • Talking with your care team about symptoms early on can stop episodes from getting worse. • You may have found a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what causes them. • Call your healthcare professional or mental health professional if you feel you're starting to have an episode of depression or mania. • Ask your family members or friends to watch for warning signs. • Get enough sleep. • Sleep disruptions often cause bipolar instability. • Stay away from drugs and alcohol. • Drinking alcohol or taking street drugs can make your symptoms worse and make them more likely to come back. • Take your medicines as directed. • You may be tempted to stop treatment, but don't. • Stopping your medicine or lowering your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects. • Also, your symptoms may get worse or return.",

      "Overview": "Bird flu, also called avian influenza, is caused by influenza type A virus infections in bird species. • Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird. • Bird flu rarely infects humans. • But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. • Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world. • People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. • People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. • Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person. • In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. • Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious. • Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. • Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. • A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. • Flu viruses have similar symptoms. • So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. • Common bird flu symptoms include: Fever. • Problems breathing. • Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Loose stool, called diarrhea. • Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. • And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher. • If you have been exposed to bird flu and have any symptoms of illness, see a healthcare professional right away. • If your work, travel or hobbies may have exposed you to bird flu, consider your symptoms. • If you have symptoms of bird flu and may have been exposed, contact your healthcare professional. • Influenza is caused by viruses that infect the cells that line the nose, throat and lungs. • Flu virus particles spread through breath, saliva, mucus or stool. • Bird flu in humans can happen when you inhale virus particles. • You also can catch the virus if you touch an object with flu particles on it, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. • People most often catch bird flu from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. • Rarely, people are exposed to bird flu by contact with wild birds or another type of animal. • But birds you may see in a park or yard, such as crows or sparrows, aren't a high risk. • They don't usually carry bird flu viruses that infect people or farm animals. • It may be possible to be exposed to bird flu through undercooked foods, such as eggs or poultry. • In places where bird flu has spread to dairy cows, it may be possible to get bird flu through raw dairy products. • But dairy products that have been heated to kill germs, called pasteurization, are not a risk for bird flu. • The risk of a human catching a bird flu is low. • Contact with sick poultry or their environment is the most common bird flu risk for people. • Infected birds can spread the virus through their breath, saliva, mucus or stool. • Rarely, people have caught bird flu after contact with wild birds or other animals. • And sometimes humans have passed a bird flu to other humans. • People with bird flu may have worsening medical issues or new health problems. • Some may be life-threatening. • Complications include: Worsening of chronic lung conditions, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. • Ear and sinus infection. • Failure of the respiratory system, called acute respiratory distress syndrome. • Kidney problems. • Heart problems. • Bleeding in the lungs, collapsed lung or bacterial pneumonia. • Sepsis. • To prevent bird flu, follow all recommended actions to protect yourself if you work with animals as a job. • If you are traveling to a place where bird flu is spreading, avoid poultry farms and bird markets if possible. • Cook food fully and wash hands with soap and water after handling food and animals. • And make sure to get your seasonal flu vaccine every year. • The U.S. • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older. • It doesn't prevent bird flu, but the seasonal flu vaccine can help you avoid having two flu viruses at the same time. • If a bird flu virus leads to a human pandemic, public health agencies have plans for vaccine development and administration. • People can take actions to further lower the risk of getting bird flu in many ways. • Avoid contact with animals who are sick or may be sick. • Wild or domestic, keep birds at a distance to avoid any germs they may carry. • Wear eye, nose and mouth protective gear when needed. • Flu viruses get in the body through the mouth, nose or eyes. • Wear eye protection, a face mask and gloves to help keep the virus out if you're in an area where it might be present. • Wash your hands with soap and water. • This is especially important after touching animals or surfaces that may be dirty with animal mucus, saliva or stool. • Getting bird flu from food is very rare. • But it's a good idea to follow safe food handling recommendations. • Avoid spreading germs in the kitchen. • Use hot, soapy water to wash all surfaces that have come into contact with raw poultry, meat, seafood or eggs. • Cook food fully. • Cook chicken until it reaches an internal minimum temperature of 165 F (74 C). • Cook eggs until the white and yolk are firm. • Egg dishes, such as quiche, should reach 160 F (71 C). • Cook beef to 145 F (63 C) and let it rest for 3 minutes. • Cook ground beef to 160 F (71 C). • Avoid raw dairy products. • Dairy milk that is heated to kill germs is called pasteurized. • In the U.S., dairy milk and foods made with it say on the Nutrition Facts label if the milk is pasteurized. • Raw milk isn't pasteurized, so it is more likely to make you sick.",

      "Overview": "Black hairy tongue is a condition of the tongue that gives it a dark, furry look. • The look usually results from a buildup of dead skin cells on the many tiny, rounded bumps on the surface of the tongue. • These bumps, called papillae, contain taste buds. • When these bumps become longer than usual, they can easily trap and be stained by tobacco, food, drinks, bacteria or yeast, or other substances. • Black hairy tongue may look alarming, but it's usually painless and doesn't cause any health problems. • The condition usually goes away by dealing with the causes and by regular mouth and tongue cleaning.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of black hairy tongue include: Black color of the tongue, but the color may be brown, green, yellow or white. • A hairy or furry look to the tongue. • Changed taste or a metallic taste in your mouth. • Bad breath. • Gagging or tickling feeling in your mouth, if the papillae are very large. • Rarely, a burning feeling on the tongue if hairy black tongue is caused by a yeast or bacterial infection. • Though it doesn't look good, black hairy tongue is usually a harmless condition. • It's usually short term when steps are taken to get rid of or manage the cause. • See your healthcare professional or dentist if: You don't know what's causing black hairy tongue and want to talk about what steps to take. • You're worried that it might be related to a health issue. • Black hairy tongue doesn't go away even though you brush your teeth and tongue twice a day.",
      "Causes": "Black hairy tongue usually happens when the many tiny, rounded bumps on the tongue, called papillae, grow too long because they don't shed dead skin cells. • Food, drinks, tobacco, bacteria or yeast, and other substances can get trapped on the papillae and stain them. • This makes the tongue look dark and hairy. • The cause of black hairy tongue can't always be found. • Possible causes of black hairy tongue include: Changes in the healthy bacteria or yeast found in the mouth when taking antibiotics. • Poor cleaning of the mouth and tongue. • Dry mouth. • Eating a soft diet that doesn't help to rub dead skin cells from your tongue. • Regularly using mouthwashes that have oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, that can irritate your mouth. • Using tobacco. • Drinking a lot of coffee or black tea. • Regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol. • Certain medicines. • Having a condition that lowers your ability to fight infections, such as cancer or HIV.",
      "Risk factors": "Poor mouth and tongue cleaning, dry mouth, and eating only soft foods may raise your risk of black hairy tongue. • If you're male or an older adult, if you smoke, or if you've had hairy black tongue in the past, you may have a higher risk of the condition."

      "Overview": "Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that begins in the cells of the bladder. • The bladder is a hollow muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. • Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder. • Urothelial cells are also found in your kidneys and the tubes (ureters) that connect the kidneys to the bladder. • Urothelial cancer can happen in the kidneys and ureters, too, but it's much more common in the bladder. • Most bladder cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, when the cancer is highly treatable. • But even early-stage bladder cancers can come back after successful treatment. • For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs.",
      "Symptoms": "Bladder cancer signs and symptoms may include: Blood in urine (hematuria), which may cause urine to appear bright red or cola colored, though sometimes the urine appears normal and blood is detected on a lab test Frequent urination Painful urination Back pain If you notice that you have discolored urine and are concerned it may contain blood, make an appointment with your doctor to get it checked. • Also make an appointment with your doctor if you have other signs or symptoms that worry you. • Bladder cancer begins when cells in the bladder develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. • A cell's DNA contains instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cell to multiply rapidly and to go on living when healthy cells would die. • The abnormal cells form a tumor that can invade and destroy normal body tissue. • In time, the abnormal cells can break away and spread (metastasize) through the body. • Different types of cells in your bladder can become cancerous. • The type of bladder cell where cancer begins determines the type of bladder cancer. • Doctors use this information to determine which treatments may work best for you. • Types of bladder cancer include: Urothelial carcinoma. • Urothelial carcinoma, previously called transitional cell carcinoma, occurs in the cells that line the inside of the bladder. • Urothelial cells expand when your bladder is full and contract when your bladder is empty. • These same cells line the inside of the ureters and the urethra, and cancers can form in those places as well. • Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer in the United States. • Squamous cell carcinoma. • Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with chronic irritation of the bladder — for instance, from an infection or from long-term use of a urinary catheter. • Squamous cell bladder cancer is rare in the United States. • It's more common in parts of the world where a certain parasitic infection (schistosomiasis) is a common cause of bladder infections. • Adenocarcinoma. • Adenocarcinoma begins in cells that make up mucus-secreting glands in the bladder. • Adenocarcinoma of the bladder is very rare. • Some bladder cancers include more than one type of cell. • Factors that may increase bladder cancer risk include: Smoking. • Smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes may increase the risk of bladder cancer by causing harmful chemicals to accumulate in the urine. • When you smoke, your body processes the chemicals in the smoke and excretes some of them in your urine. • These harmful chemicals may damage the lining of your bladder, which can increase your risk of cancer. • Increasing age. • Bladder cancer risk increases as you age. • Though it can occur at any age, most people diagnosed with bladder cancer are older than 55. • Being male. • Men are more likely to develop bladder cancer than women are. • Exposure to certain chemicals. • Your kidneys play a key role in filtering harmful chemicals from your bloodstream and moving them into your bladder. • Because of this, it's thought that being around certain chemicals may increase the risk of bladder cancer. • Chemicals linked to bladder cancer risk include arsenic and chemicals used in the manufacture of dyes, rubber, leather, textiles and paint products. • Previous cancer treatment. • Treatment with the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer. • People who received radiation treatments aimed at the pelvis for a previous cancer have a higher risk of developing bladder cancer. • Chronic bladder inflammation. • Chronic or repeated urinary infections or inflammations (cystitis), such as might happen with long-term use of a urinary catheter, may increase the risk of a squamous cell bladder cancer. • In some areas of the world, squamous cell carcinoma is linked to chronic bladder inflammation caused by the parasitic infection known as schistosomiasis. • Personal or family history of cancer. • If you've had bladder cancer, you're more likely to get it again. • If one of your blood relatives — a parent, sibling or child — has a history of bladder cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease, although it's rare for bladder cancer to run in families. • A family history of Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), can increase the risk of cancer in the urinary system, as well as in the colon, uterus, ovaries and other organs. • Although there's no guaranteed way to prevent bladder cancer, you can take steps to help reduce your risk. • For instance: Don't smoke. • If you don't smoke, don't start. • If you smoke, talk to your doctor about a plan to help you stop. • Support groups, medications and other methods may help you quit. • Take caution around chemicals. • If you work with chemicals, follow all safety instructions to avoid exposure. • Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables. • Choose a diet rich in a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. • The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may help reduce your risk of cancer.",

      "Overview": "Bladder exstrophy (EK-stroh-fee) is a rare condition present at birth. • During pregnancy, the bladder of an unborn baby, also called a fetus, forms outside of the stomach area. • This area also is called the abdomen. • The exposed bladder can't store urine or work as it should. • This causes the baby to leak urine after being born. • Bladder exstrophy also can affect the genitals, stomach muscles, pelvic bones, intestines and reproductive organs. • The cause of the condition isn't clear, but genes may play a role. • Bladder exstrophy may be spotted on a routine ultrasound during pregnancy. • But sometimes, the condition can't be seen until the baby is born. • A baby born with bladder exstrophy needs surgery to close the bladder and repair other affected body parts as needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Bladder exstrophy can involve a spectrum of symptoms. • The symptoms depend on which body parts are affected along with the bladder and stomach area, and how serious the effects are. • Bladder exstrophy is the most common in a larger group of conditions present at birth called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). • Children with BEEC have one of the following: Epispadias. • This is the least serious form of BEEC. • With an epispadias (ep-ih-SPAY-dee-us), the tube through which urine leaves the body doesn't fully develop. • This tube is called the urethra. • Bladder exstrophy. • This condition causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. • The bladder also is turned inside out. • Usually, bladder exstrophy involves organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. • Changes in the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals and pelvic bones can happen. • So can changes in the end part of the large intestine called the rectum and the opening at the end of the rectum called the anus. • Children with bladder exstrophy also have a condition that causes urine to flow the wrong way. • This is called vesicoureteral reflux. • Urine flows backward from the bladder into tubes called ureters that connect to the kidneys. • Children with bladder exstrophy have epispadias as well. • Cloacal exstrophy. • Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-AY-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. • In this condition, the bladder and intestine are exposed. • The anus may not open and the intestine may be short. • The penis or the vagina may be split. • The pelvic bones are affected as well. • The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. • Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal conditions, including spina bifida. • Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.",
      "Causes": "The cause of bladder exstrophy isn't known. • But researchers think that genetic factors likely play a role. • What's known is that during pregnancy, a tissue called the cloaca (klo-AY-kuh) typically covers the wall of the unborn baby's lower stomach. • Later, it's replaced by stomach muscles. • But if the cloaca bursts before the stomach muscles form, bladder exstrophy may develop.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that raise the risk of bladder exstrophy include: Family history. • Firstborn children, children of a parent with bladder exstrophy or siblings of a child with bladder exstrophy have a higher chance of being born with the condition. • Race. • Bladder exstrophy is more common in white babies than in Black or Hispanic babies. • Male sex. • More boys than girls are born with bladder exstrophy. • Use of assisted reproduction to become pregnant. • Children born through fertility treatments known as assisted reproductive technologies have a higher risk of bladder exstrophy. • These treatments include in vitro fertilization.",
      "Complications": "Bladder exstrophy can lead to other health conditions called complications. • Without treatment, children with bladder exstrophy won't be able to hold urine. • This is called urinary incontinence. • These children also are at risk of having trouble with sexual function later in life. • They have a higher risk of bladder cancer as well. • Surgery can lower the chances of some complications. • The success of surgery depends on how serious the condition is. • Many children who have surgical repair are able to hold urine. • Young children with bladder exstrophy may walk with their legs turned somewhat outward. • This is due to the separation of their pelvic bones. • Walking gets better with age. • People born with bladder exstrophy can go on to have regular sexual function. • That includes being able to have children. • But pregnancy often is high risk for a pregnant person who's had bladder exstrophy and for the unborn baby. • A planned cesarean birth, also known as a C-section, may be needed."

      "Overview": "It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. • In many cases, the cause is harmless. • But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness. • If you can see the blood, it's called gross hematuria. • Blood that can't be seen with the naked eye is called microscopic hematuria. • It's such a small amount that it can be seen only under a microscope when a lab tests the urine. • Either way, it's important to figure out the reason for the bleeding. • Treatment depends on the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. • Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. • It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red. • The bleeding often isn't painful. • But if blood clots get passed in the urine, that can hurt. • See a health care provider whenever urine looks like it might have blood in it. • Red urine isn't always caused by red blood cells. • Some medicines can cause urine to turn red, such as a medicine called phenazopyridine that eases urinary tract symptoms. • Certain foods also can turn urine red, including beets and rhubarb. • It can be hard to tell whether a change of urine color is caused by blood. • That's why it's always best to get a checkup. • This condition happens when the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract let blood cells leak into urine. • Different problems can cause this leaking to happen, including: Urinary tract infections (UTIs). • These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. • Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder. • UTIs can cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. • With a UTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. • You may have pain and burning while peeing. • Your urine may have a very strong smell too. • Kidney infection. • This type of UTI also is called pyelonephritis. • Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. • Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. • Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that other UTIs can. • But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin. • A bladder or kidney stone. • The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. • Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones. • The stones are often painless. • But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. • Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab. • Enlarged prostate. • The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. • It often gets bigger toward middle age. • It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. • With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. • Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms. • Kidney disease. • Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. • With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed. • Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. • Or it can happen on its own. • Cancer. • Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. • These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better. • Inherited illnesses. • A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. • The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. • A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine. • Kidney injury. • A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine. • Medicines. • The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. • Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. • These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. • Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause. • Hard exercise. • Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. • It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. • Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. • It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. • When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week. • If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. • See your health care provider. • Often the cause of hematuria is unknown. • Almost anyone can have red blood cells in the urine. • This includes children and teens. • Some things that can raise the risk of blood in the urine include: Age. • Middle-aged and older men may be more likely to have hematuria due to an enlarged prostate gland. • The risk of some cancers that can cause blood in urine also may rise after the age of 50. • Urinary tract infection. • This is one of the top causes of blood that can be seen in children's urine. • Family history. • The chances of having blood in the urine may go up if one or more family members have had kidney disease. • Certain medicines. • Some pain relievers, blood thinners and antibiotics can raise the risk of blood in urine. • Hard exercise. • Marathon runner's hematuria is one nickname for hematuria. • Contact sports can raise the risk too.",
      "Causes": "This condition happens when the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract let blood cells leak into urine. • Different problems can cause this leaking to happen, including: Urinary tract infections (UTIs). • These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. • Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder. • UTIs can cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. • With a UTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. • You may have pain and burning while peeing. • Your urine may have a very strong smell too. • Kidney infection. • This type of UTI also is called pyelonephritis. • Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. • Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. • Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that other UTIs can. • But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin. • A bladder or kidney stone. • The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. • Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones. • The stones are often painless. • But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. • Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab. • Enlarged prostate. • The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. • It often gets bigger toward middle age. • It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. • With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. • Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms. • Kidney disease. • Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. • With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed. • Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. • Or it can happen on its own. • Cancer. • Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. • These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better. • Inherited illnesses. • A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. • The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. • A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine. • Kidney injury. • A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine. • Medicines. • The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. • Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. • These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. • Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause. • Hard exercise. • Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. • It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. • Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. • It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. • When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week. • If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. • See your health care provider. • Often the cause of hematuria is unknown.",

      "Overview": "Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental health condition in which you can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws in your appearance — a flaw that appears minor or can't be seen by others. • But you may feel so embarrassed, ashamed and anxious that you may avoid many social situations. • When you have body dysmorphic disorder, you intensely focus on your appearance and body image, repeatedly checking the mirror, grooming or seeking reassurance, sometimes for many hours each day. • Your perceived flaw and the repetitive behaviors cause you significant distress and impact your ability to function in your daily life. • You may seek out numerous cosmetic procedures to try to \"fix\" your perceived flaw. • Afterward, you may feel temporary satisfaction or a reduction in your distress, but often the anxiety returns and you may resume searching for other ways to fix your perceived flaw. • Treatment of body dysmorphic disorder may include cognitive behavioral therapy and medication.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder include: Being extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw in appearance that to others can't be seen or appears minor Strong belief that you have a defect in your appearance that makes you ugly or deformed Belief that others take special notice of your appearance in a negative way or mock you Engaging in behaviors aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flaw that are difficult to resist or control, such as frequently checking the mirror, grooming or skin picking Attempting to hide perceived flaws with styling, makeup or clothes Constantly comparing your appearance with others Frequently seeking reassurance about your appearance from others Having perfectionist tendencies Seeking cosmetic procedures with little satisfaction Avoiding social situations Preoccupation with your appearance and excessive thoughts and repetitive behaviors can be unwanted, difficult to control and so time-consuming that they can cause major distress or problems in your social life, work, school or other areas of functioning. • You may excessively focus over one or more parts of your body. • The bodily feature that you focus on may change over time. • The most common features people tend to fixate about include: Face, such as nose, complexion, wrinkles, acne and other blemishes Hair, such as appearance, thinning and baldness Skin and vein appearance Breast size Muscle size and tone Genitalia A preoccupation with your body build being too small or not muscular enough (muscle dysmorphia) occurs almost exclusively in males. • Insight about body dysmorphic disorder varies. • You may recognize that your beliefs about your perceived flaws may be excessive or not be true, or think that they probably are true, or be absolutely convinced that they're true. • The more convinced you are of your beliefs, the more distress and disruption you may experience in your life. • Shame and embarrassment about your appearance may keep you from seeking treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. • But if you have any signs or symptoms, see your health care provider or a mental health professional. • Body dysmorphic disorder usually doesn't get better on its own. • If left untreated, it may get worse over time, leading to anxiety, extensive medical bills, severe depression, and even suicidal thoughts and behavior. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with body dysmorphic disorder. • If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away: In the U.S, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • Call your mental health professional. • Seek help from your primary care provider. • Reach out to a close friend or loved one. • Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.",
      "Causes": "It's not known specifically what causes body dysmorphic disorder. • Like many other mental health conditions, body dysmorphic disorder may result from a combination of issues, such as a family history of the disorder, negative evaluations or experiences about your body or self-image, and abnormal brain function or abnormal levels of the brain chemical called serotonin.",
      "Risk factors": "Body dysmorphic disorder typically starts in the early teenage years and it affects both males and females. • Certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering body dysmorphic disorder, including: Having blood relatives with body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder Negative life experiences, such as childhood teasing, neglect or abuse Certain personality traits, such as perfectionism Societal pressure or expectations of beauty Having another mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression",
      "Complications": "Complications that may be caused by or associated with body dysmorphic disorder include, for example: Low self-esteem Social isolation Major depression or other mood disorders Suicidal thoughts or behavior Anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder (social phobia) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Eating disorders Substance misuse Health problems from behaviors such as skin picking Physical pain or risk of disfigurement due to repeated surgical interventions",
      "Prevention": "There's no known way to prevent body dysmorphic disorder. • However, because body dysmorphic disorder often starts in the early teenage years, identifying the disorder early and starting treatment may be of some benefit. • Long-term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms."

      "Overview": "Botulism is a rare but serious condition caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. • Botulism may cause life-threatening symptoms. • A type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin. • Botulism can occur as the result of food or wound contamination. • The condition can also occur when bacterial spores grow in the intestines of infants. • In rare cases, botulism can also be caused by medical treatment or bioterrorism. • Three common forms of botulism are: Foodborne botulism. • The harmful bacteria thrive and make the toxin in environments with little oxygen, such as in home-canned food. • Wound botulism. • If these bacteria get into a cut, they can cause a dangerous infection that makes the toxin. • Infant botulism. • This most generic form of botulism begins after spores of C. botulinum bacteria grow in a baby's intestinal tract. • It typically occurs in babies between the ages of 2 months and 8 months. • In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults. • Occasionally, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons. • This rare form is called iatrogenic botulism. • The term \"iatrogenic\" means an illness caused by medical exam or treatment. • Another rare form of botulism can occur from inhaling toxins. • This may happen as the result of bioterrorism. • All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body. • But depending on how much toxin you consumed, the start of symptoms may range from a few hours to a few days. • Symptoms of foodborne botulism include: Trouble swallowing or speaking Dry mouth Facial weakness on both sides of the face Blurred or double vision Drooping eyelids Trouble breathing Nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps Paralysis Symptoms of wound botulism appear about 10 days after the toxin enters your body. • Wound botulism symptoms include: Trouble swallowing or speaking Facial weakness on both sides of the face Blurred or double vision Drooping eyelids Trouble breathing Paralysis The area around the wound may not always appear swollen and show a change of color. • Problems generally begin 18 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the baby's body. • Symptoms include: Constipation, which is often the first symptom Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head Weak cry Irritability Drooling Drooping eyelids Tiredness Trouble sucking or feeding Paralysis Certain symptoms don't typically occur with botulism. • For example, botulism doesn't usually raise blood pressure or heart rate or cause fever or confusion. • Sometimes, though, wound botulism may cause fever. • In iatrogenic botulism — when the toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons — there have been rare occurrences of serious side effects. • These may include headache, facial paralysis, and muscle weakness. • Seek urgent medical care if you suspect that you have botulism. • Initial treatment increases your survival chances and lowers your risk of complications. • Getting medical care quickly can also alert public health officials about episodes of foodborne botulism. • They may be able to keep other people from eating contaminated food. • Keep in mind, though, that botulism can't spread from person to person. • An unusual cluster of botulism — especially in people with no clear link — that develops in about 12 to 48 hours may raise suspicion of bioterrorism.",
      "Causes": "The typical source of foodborne botulism is homemade food that is improperly canned or preserved. • These foods are typically fruits, vegetables, and fish. • Other foods, such as spicy peppers (chiles), foil-wrapped baked potatoes and oil infused with garlic, may also be sources of botulism. • When C. botulinum bacteria get into a wound, they can multiply and make toxin. • The wound may be a cut that wasn't noticed. • Or the wound may be caused by a traumatic injury or surgery. • Wound botulism has increased in recent decades in people who inject heroin, which can contain spores of the bacteria. • In fact, this form of botulism is more common in people who inject black tar heroin. • Babies get infant botulism when the bacteria spores get into their intestines and make toxin. • In some cases, the source of infant botulism may be honey. • But it's more likely to be exposure to soil contaminated with the bacteria. • In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults. • Rarely, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as removing wrinkles, or for medical reasons, such as treating migraines.",
      "Complications": "Because it affects muscle control throughout your body, botulinum toxin can cause many complications. • The most immediate danger is that you won't be able to breathe. • Being unable to breathe is a common cause of death in botulism. • Other complications, which may need rehabilitation, may include: Difficulty speaking Trouble swallowing Long-lasting weakness Shortness of breath",
      "Prevention": "Use proper techniques when canning or preserving foods at home to make sure botulism germs are destroyed. • It's also important to prepare and store food safely: Pressure-cook home-canned foods at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 Celsius) for 20 to 100 minutes, depending on the food. • Think about boiling these foods for 10 minutes before serving them. • Don't eat preserved food if its container is bulging or if the food smells bad. • But, taste and smell won't always give away the presence of C. botulinum. • Some strains don't make food smell bad or taste unusual. • If you wrap potatoes in foil before baking, eat them hot. • Loosen the foil and store the potatoes in the refrigerator — not at room temperature. • Store homemade oils infused with garlic or herbs in the refrigerator. • Throw them out after four days. • Refrigerate canned foods after you open them. • To prevent wound botulism and other serious bloodborne diseases, never inject or inhale street drugs. • Keep wounds clean to prevent infection. • If you think a wound is infected, seek medical treatment right away. • To lower the risk of infant botulism, avoid giving honey — even a tiny taste — to children under the age of 1 year. • To prevent iatrogenic botulism, be sure to go to a licensed health care provider for any cosmetic or medical procedures using various forms of botulinum toxin. • They include onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) and others."

      "Overview": "The brachial plexus is the group of nerves that sends signals from the spinal cord to the shoulder, arm and hand. • A brachial plexus injury happens when these nerves are stretched, squeezed together, or in the most serious cases, ripped apart or torn away from the spinal cord. • Minor brachial plexus injuries, called stingers or burners, are common in contact sports, such as football. • Babies sometimes get brachial plexus injuries when they're born. • Other health issues, such as inflammation or tumors, may affect the brachial plexus. • The most serious brachial plexus injuries happen during car or motorcycle accidents. • Bad brachial plexus injuries can leave the arm paralyzed, but surgery may help.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can differ depending on how serious the injury is and where it's located. • Usually only one arm is affected. • Minor damage often happens during contact sports, such as football or wrestling, when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched or squeezed together. • These are called stingers or burners. • Some of the symptoms are: A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm. • Numbness and weakness in the arm. • These symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may last for days or longer. • More-serious symptoms happen when an injury seriously damages or even tears or ruptures the nerves. • The most serious brachial plexus injury is when the nerve root is cut or torn from the spinal cord. • Symptoms of serious injuries can include: Weakness or not being able to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder. • Loss of feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand. • Intense pain. • Brachial plexus injuries can cause lasting weakness or disability. • Even if yours seems minor, you may need medical care. • See your healthcare provider if you have: Burners and stingers that keep coming back, or symptoms that don't go away quickly. • Weakness in the hand or arm. • Neck pain. • Symptoms in both arms.",
      "Causes": "Brachial plexus injuries in the upper nerves happen when the shoulder is forced down on one side of the body and the head is pushed to the other side in the opposite direction. • The lower nerves are more likely to be injured when the arm is forced above the head. • These injuries can happen in many ways, including: Contact sports. • Many football players have burners or stingers. • These are caused when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched past their limit during clashes with other players. • Birth. • Newborns can have brachial plexus injuries. • This is more common in babies with a high birth weight, a very long labor and a bottom-first, also called breech, presentation. • If a baby's shoulders get stuck in the birth canal, brachial plexus palsy is more likely. • Most often, the upper nerves are injured. • This is called Erb palsy. • Injuries. • Many injuries — including those from motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, falls or bullet wounds — can damage the brachial plexus. • Tumors and cancer treatments. • Tumors can grow on their own. • Rarely, they can form because of a health condition, such as neurofibromatosis, or after radiation treatment.",
      "Risk factors": "Playing contact sports, especially football and wrestling, or being in high-speed motor vehicle accidents increases the risk of brachial plexus injury.",
      "Complications": "Many mild brachial plexus injuries heal over time with few to no issues. • But some injuries can cause short-term or lasting problems, such as: Stiff joints. • If you have hand or arm paralysis, the joints can get stiff. • This can make it hard to move, even if you are able to use your hand or arm again. • For that reason, your healthcare professional may suggest ongoing physical therapy during your recovery. • Pain. • This is caused by nerve damage and may be lifelong. • Numbness. • If you lose feeling in the arm or hand, you're at risk of burning or injuring yourself without knowing it. • Muscle atrophy. • Nerves regrow slowly and can take many years to heal after injury. • During that time, not using your muscles may cause them to break down. • Permanent disability. • How well you recover from a serious brachial plexus injury depends on many things, such as your age and the type, location and seriousness of the injury. • Even with surgery, some people have muscle weakness or paralysis that lasts for the rest of their lives.",
      "Prevention": "Although a brachial plexus injury can't always be avoided, you can take steps to reduce your risk of complications after getting hurt: For yourself. • If you can't use the hand or arm for a short time, daily range-of-motion exercises and physical therapy can help prevent joint stiffness. • Avoid burns or cuts, as you may not feel them if you have numbness. • If you're an athlete with a brachial plexus injury, your healthcare professional may suggest that you wear padding to protect the area when you play sports. • For your child. • If your child has brachial plexus palsy, it's important to exercise your child's joints and working muscles every day. • You can start when your baby is just a few weeks old. • This helps stop the joints from becoming permanently stiff. • It also keeps your child's working muscles strong and healthy."

      "Overview": "Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heart rate. • The hearts of adults at rest usually beat between 60 and 100 times a minute. • If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute. • Bradycardia can be a serious problem if the heart rate is very slow and the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. • If this happens, you may feel dizzy, very tired or weak, and short of breath. • Sometimes bradycardia doesn't cause symptoms or complications. • A slow heart rate isn't always a concern. • For example, a resting heart rate between 40 and 60 beats a minute is common in some people, particularly healthy young adults and trained athletes. • It also is quite common during sleep. • If bradycardia is severe, a pacemaker may be needed to help the heart beat at an appropriate rate.",
      "Symptoms": "A slower than typical heartbeat is called bradycardia. • If the slow heartbeat stops the brain and other organs from getting enough oxygen, symptoms may include: Chest pain. • Confusion or memory problems. • Dizziness or lightheadedness. • Feeling very tired, especially during physical activity. • Fainting or near-fainting. • Shortness of breath. • Many things can cause symptoms of bradycardia. • It's important to get a fast, accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. • Make an appointment for a health checkup if you are worried about a slow heart rate. • If you faint, have difficulty breathing or have chest pain lasting more than a few minutes, call 911 or emergency medical services. • Bradycardia can be caused by: Heart tissue damage related to aging. • Damage to heart tissues from heart disease or heart attack. • A heart condition that you're born with, called a congenital heart defect. • Inflammation of heart tissue, called myocarditis. • A complication of heart surgery. • An underactive thyroid gland, called hypothyroidism. • Changes in the level of body minerals such as potassium or calcium. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Inflammatory disease, such as rheumatic fever or lupus. • Certain medicines, including sedatives, opioids, and some used to treat heart and mental health conditions. • To better understand the causes of bradycardia, it may help to know how the heart typically beats. • The typical heart has four chambers. • The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • Within the heart's upper right chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. • The sinus node is the heart's natural pacemaker. • It creates the signal that starts each heartbeat. • Bradycardia happens when these signals slow down or are blocked. • Things that cause changes in heart signaling that can lead to bradycardia include: Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. • In some people, problems in the sinus node at the top of the heart cause alternating slow and fast heart rates. • Heart block, also called atrioventricular block. • In this condition, the heart's electrical signals don't move correctly from the upper chambers to the lower chambers. • Bradycardia is often associated with damage to heart tissue from some type of heart disease. • Anything that increases the risk of heart problems can increase the risk of bradycardia. • Risk factors include: Older age. • High blood pressure. • Smoking. • Heavy alcohol use. • Illegal drug use. • Stress and anxiety. • Possible complications of bradycardia include: Frequent fainting. • Heart failure. • Sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death. • Preventing heart disease may help lower the risk of bradycardia. • The American Heart Association recommends these steps: Get regular exercise. • Ask your healthcare team about how much and what type of exercise is best for you. • Eat nutritious foods. • Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Keep a healthy weight. • Being overweight increases the risk of heart disease. • Talk with your care team to set realistic goals for body mass index (BMI) and weight. • Control blood pressure and cholesterol. • High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease. • Make lifestyle changes and take medicines as directed to manage high blood pressure or high cholesterol. • Don't smoke or use tobacco. • If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to a healthcare professional about methods or programs to help. • Limit or do not drink alcohol. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Manage stress. • Intense emotions may affect the heart rate. • Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to reduce and manage stress. • Get good sleep. • Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. • Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. • Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. • If you have trouble sleeping, talk to a healthcare professional about strategies that might help. • It's important to have regular health checkups. • If you already have heart disease, take these steps to lower your risk of irregular heartbeats: Follow your treatment plan. • Be sure you understand your treatment. • Take all medicines as directed by your healthcare team. • Tell your care team if your symptoms change. • Also tell the healthcare team if you have new symptoms.",

      "Overview": "A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) — also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm — is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. • An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem. • Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. • This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. • If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. • Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. • This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. • Brain aneurysms are common. • But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. • Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. • They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. • In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions. • However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires medical treatment right away. • If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases. • Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future. • Talk with your health care provider to make sure you understand the best options for your specific needs. • Saccular aneurysm, also known as a berry aneurysm. • This type of aneurysm looks like a berry hanging from a vine. • It's a round, blood-filled sac that protrudes from the main artery or one of its branches. • It usually forms on arteries at the base of the brain. • A berry aneurysm is the most common type of aneurysm. • Fusiform aneurysm. • This type of aneurysm causes bulging on all sides of the artery. • Mycotic aneurysm. • This type of aneurysm is caused by an infection. • When an infection affects the arteries in the brain, it can weaken the artery wall. • This can cause an aneurysm to form.",
      "Symptoms": "Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. • This is especially true if they're small. • Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. • However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. • And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms. • A sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm. • This headache is often described by people as the worst headache they've ever experienced. • In addition to a severe headache, symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: Nausea and vomiting Stiff neck Blurred or double vision Sensitivity to light Seizure A drooping eyelid Loss of consciousness Confusion In some cases, an aneurysm may leak a slight amount of blood. • When this happens, a more severe rupture often follows. • Leaks may happen days or weeks before a rupture. • Leaking brain aneurysm symptoms may include: A sudden, extremely severe headache that may last several days and up to two weeks. • An unruptured brain aneurysm may not have any symptoms, especially if it's small. • However, a larger unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves. • Symptoms of an unruptured brain aneurysm may include: Pain above and behind one eye. • A dilated pupil. • A change in vision or double vision. • Numbness of one side of the face. • Seek immediate medical attention if you develop a: Sudden, extremely severe headache If you're with someone who complains of a sudden, severe headache or who loses consciousness or has a seizure, call 911 or your local emergency number. • Brain aneurysms are caused by thinning artery walls. • Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those areas of the vessels are weaker. • Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain, they're most common in arteries at the base of the brain. • Several factors can contribute to weakness in an artery wall. • These factors may increase the risk of a brain aneurysm or aneurysm rupture. • Some of these risk factors develop over time. • But some conditions present at birth can increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm. • Risk factors include: Older age. • Brain aneurysms can occur at any age. • However, they're more common in adults between ages 30 and 60. • Being female. • Brain aneurysms are more common in women than in men. • Cigarette smoking. • Smoking is a risk factor for brain aneurysms to form and for brain aneurysms to rupture. • High blood pressure. • This condition can weaken arteries. • Aneurysms are more likely to form and to rupture in weakened arteries. • Drug use, particularly using cocaine. • Drug use raises blood pressure. • If illicit drugs are used intravenously, it can lead to an infection. • An infection can cause a mycotic aneurysm. • Heavy alcohol use. • This also can increase blood pressure. • Inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. • These disorders weaken blood vessels. • Polycystic kidney disease. • This inherited disorder results in fluid-filled sacs in the kidneys. • It also may increase blood pressure. • A narrow aorta, known as coarctation of the aorta. • The aorta is the large blood vessel that delivers oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. • Brain arteriovenous malformation, known as AVM. • In this condition, arteries and veins in the brain are tangled. • This affects blood flow. • A family history of brain aneurysm. • Your risk is higher if you have family members who have had a brain aneurysm. • This is particularly true if two or more first-degree relatives — such as a parent, brother, sister or child — has had a brain aneurysm. • If you have a family history, you can ask your health care provider about getting screened for a brain aneurysm. • Some types of aneurysms may occur after a head injury or from certain blood infections. • There are some factors that make it more likely an aneurysm will rupture. • They include: Having a large aneurysm. • Having aneurysms in certain locations. • Smoking cigarettes. • Having untreated high blood pressure. • When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds. • However, the blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells and can kill brain cells. • It also increases pressure inside the skull. • If the pressure becomes too high, it may disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. • Loss of consciousness or even death may occur. • Complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include: Re-bleeding. • An aneurysm that has ruptured or has leaked is at risk of bleeding again. • Re-bleeding can cause further damage to brain cells. • Narrowed blood vessels in the brain. • After a brain aneurysm ruptures, blood vessels in the brain may contract and narrow. • This is known as vasospasm. • Vasospasm can cause an ischemic stroke, in which there's limited blood flow to brain cells. • This may cause additional cell damage and loss. • A buildup of fluid within the brain, known as hydrocephalus. • Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. • The blood can block the movement of fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. • As a result, an excess of fluid puts pressure on the brain and can damage tissues. • Change in sodium level. • Bleeding in the brain can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood. • This may occur from damage to the hypothalamus, an area near the base of the brain. • A drop in blood sodium levels can lead to swelling of brain cells and permanent damage. • In many cases, brain aneurysms can't be prevented. • But there are some changes you can make to lower your risk. • They include quitting smoking if you smoke. • Also work with your health care provider to lower your blood pressure if it's high. • Don't drink large amounts of alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine.",

      "Overview": "A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain. • Arteries take oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. • Veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. • A brain AVM disrupts this vital process. • An arteriovenous malformation can develop anywhere in the body, but common locations include the brain and spinal cord. • Overall, brain AVMs are rare. • The cause of brain AVMs isn't clear. • Most people who have them are born with them, but they can form later in life. • Rarely, AVM can be a trait passed down in families. • Some people with brain AVMs experience symptoms such as headaches or seizures. • A brain AVM may be found after a brain scan for another health issue. • Sometimes a brain AVM is found after the blood vessels burst and bleed, known as a hemorrhage. • Once diagnosed, a brain AVM can be treated to prevent complications such as brain damage or stroke.",
      "Symptoms": "A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may not cause any symptoms until the AVM bursts and bleeds, known as a hemorrhage. • In about half of all brain AVMs, a hemorrhage is the first sign of the malformation. • But some people with brain AVMs may experience symptoms other than bleeding, such as: Seizures. • Headaches or pain in one area of the head. • Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body. • Some people may experience more-serious symptoms depending on the location of the AVM, including: A very bad headache. • Weakness, numbness or paralysis. • Vision loss. • Trouble speaking. • Confusion or not being able to understand others. • Trouble with walking. • Symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually appear between ages 10 and 40. • Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. • The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood. • By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms. • Get medical care right away if you notice any symptoms of a brain AVM, such as seizures, headaches or other symptoms. • A bleeding brain AVM is dangerous and requires emergency medical care.",
      "Causes": "The cause of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is not known. • Researchers believe most brain AVMs are present at birth and form during a baby's growth in the womb. • But brain AVMs can happen later in life as well. • Brain AVMs are seen in some people who have hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). • HHT also is known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. • HHT affects the way blood vessels form in several areas of the body, including the brain. • Typically, the heart sends oxygen-rich blood to the brain through arteries. • The arteries slow blood flow by passing the blood through a series of smaller and smaller blood vessels. • The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. • The capillaries slowly deliver oxygen through their thin, porous walls to the surrounding brain tissue. • The oxygen-depleted blood passes into small blood vessels and then into larger veins. • The veins return the blood to the heart and lungs to get more oxygen. • The arteries and veins in an AVM lack this supporting network of smaller blood vessels and capillaries. • Instead, blood flows quickly and directly from the arteries to the veins. • When this happens, surrounding brain tissue doesn't receive the oxygen it needs.",
      "Risk factors": "Anyone can be born with a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), but these factors may raise the risk: Being male. • Brain AVMs are more common in men. • Having a family history. • Rarely, brain AVMs occur in families, but it's not clear if there's a certain genetic risk factor. • It's also possible to inherit other medical conditions that increase the risk of brain AVMs, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).",
      "Complications": "Complications of a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) include: Bleeding in the brain. • A brain AVM puts extreme pressure on the walls of the affected arteries and veins. • The pressure causes the arteries and veins to become thin or weak. • This may result in the AVM breaking open and bleeding into the brain, known as a hemorrhage. • This risk of a brain AVM bleeding ranges from around 2% to 3% each year. • The risk of bleeding may be higher for certain types of AVM. • Risk also may be higher in people who have had a brain AVM bleed in the past. • Although studies haven't found that pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhage in people with a brain AVM, more research is needed. • Some hemorrhages associated with brain AVMs aren't detected because they cause no major symptoms. • However, potentially dangerous bleeding can occur. • Brain AVMs account for about 2% of all hemorrhagic strokes each year. • In children and young adults who experience brain hemorrhage, brain AVMs are often the cause. • Reduced oxygen to brain tissue. • With a brain AVM, blood doesn't flow through the network of small blood vessels called capillaries. • Instead, it flows directly from arteries to veins. • Blood rushes quickly because it isn't slowed by the smaller blood vessels. • Surrounding brain tissue can't easily absorb oxygen from the fast-flowing blood. • Without enough oxygen, brain tissues weaken or may die off completely. • This results in stroke-like symptoms, such as trouble speaking, weakness, numbness, vision loss or trouble staying steady. • Thin or weak blood vessels. • An AVM puts extreme pressure on the thin and weak walls of the blood vessels. • A bulge in a blood vessel wall, known as an aneurysm, may form. • The aneurysm may be at risk of bursting. • Brain damage. • The body may use more arteries to supply blood to the fast-flowing brain AVM. • As a result, some AVMs may get bigger and displace or compress portions of the brain. • This may prevent protective fluids from flowing freely around the brain. • If fluid builds up, it can push brain tissue against the skull. • One type of brain AVM that involves a major blood vessel called the vein of Galen causes serious complications in babies. • Symptoms are present at birth or appear soon after birth. • This type of brain AVM causes fluid to build up in the brain and the head to swell. • Swollen veins may be seen on the scalp, and seizures may occur. • Children with this type of brain AVM can have a failure to thrive and congestive heart failure."

      "Overview": "A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. • Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue. • Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. • Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain. • Brain tumors can begin in the brain. • These are called primary brain tumors. • Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. • These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors. • Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. • Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. • These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. • Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. • Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. • Brain cancers may grow quickly. • The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue. • Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. • Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. • Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. • Some parts of the brain are less active than others. • If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. • The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected. • Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location. • Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy. • There are many types of brain tumors. • The type of brain tumor is based on the kind of cells that make up the tumor. • Special lab tests on the tumor cells can give information about the cells. • Your health care team uses this information to figure out the type of brain tumor. • Some types of brain tumors usually aren't cancerous. • These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. • Some types of brain tumors usually are cancerous. • These types are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. • Some brain tumor types can be benign or malignant. • Benign brain tumors tend to be slow-growing brain tumors. • Malignant brain tumors tend to be fast-growing brain tumors. • Types of brain tumors include: Gliomas and related brain tumors. • Gliomas are growths of cells that look like glial cells. • The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain tissue. • Types of gliomas and related brain tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma. • Gliomas can be benign, but most are malignant. • Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor. • Choroid plexus tumors. • Choroid plexus tumors start in cells that make the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. • This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. • Choroid plexus tumors are located in the fluid-filled cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. • Choroid plexus tumors can be benign or malignant. • Choroid plexus carcinoma is the malignant form of this type of brain tumor. • It's more common in children. • Embryonal tumors. • Embryonal tumors begin in cells that are left over from fetal development. • The cells, called embryonal cells, stay in the brain after birth. • Embryonal tumors are malignant brain tumors that happen most often in babies and young children. • The most common type of embryonal tumor is medulloblastoma. • It's usually located in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum. • Germ cell tumors. • Germ cell tumors start in reproductive cells, called germ cells, that go on to become the sperm and egg cells. • Germ cells are mostly in the ovaries and testicles. • But sometimes they're in other parts of the body, including the brain. • When germ cell tumors happen in the brain, they're often located near the pineal gland or the pituitary gland. • Germ cell tumors are mostly benign. • They're more common in children. • Pineal tumors. • Pineal tumors start in and around the brain's pineal gland. • The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. • It makes a hormone called melatonin that helps with sleep. • Pineal tumors can be benign or malignant. • Pineoblastoma is a malignant type of pineal tumor that's most common in children. • Meningiomas. • Meningiomas are brain tumors that start in the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. • Meningiomas are usually benign, but sometimes they can be malignant. • Meningiomas are the most common type of benign brain tumor. • Nerve tumors. • Nerve tumors are growths that happen in and around nerves. • The most common type that happens in the head is acoustic neuroma, also called schwannoma. • This benign tumor is located on the main nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain. • Pituitary tumors. • Brain tumors can begin in and around the pituitary gland. • This small gland is located near the base of the brain. • Most tumors that happen in and around the pituitary gland are benign. • Pituitary tumors happen in the pituitary gland itself. • Craniopharyngioma is a type of brain tumor that happens near the pituitary gland. • Other brain tumors. • Many other types of rare tumors can happen in and around the brain. • Tumors can start in the muscles, blood vessels and connective tissue around the brain. • Tumors can form in the bones of the skull. • Malignant brain tumors can start from the germ-fighting immune system cells in the brain. • This type of brain cancer is called primary central nervous system lymphoma.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. • Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. • General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include: Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. • Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. • Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines. • Nausea or vomiting. • Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision. • Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg. • Trouble with balance. • Speech problems. • Feeling very tired. • Confusion in everyday matters. • Memory problems. • Having trouble following simple commands. • Personality or behavior changes. • Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures. • Hearing problems. • Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo. • Feeling very hungry and gaining weight. • Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly. • Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. • They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. • The symptoms might get worse over months or years. • Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. • Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. • They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. • They get worse in a matter of days or weeks. • Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. • Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. • Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. • Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache. • Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. • But it can happen at any time. • Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. • Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. • People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. • Some people say the headache feels like a migraine. • Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. • If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain. • The main part of the brain is called the cerebrum. • Brain tumors in different parts of the cerebrum might cause different symptoms. • Brain tumors in the front of the brain. • The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain. • They control thinking and movement. • Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking. • There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities. • Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different. • Brain tumors in the middle of the brain. • The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain. • They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. • Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses. • Examples include vision problems and hearing problems. • Brain tumors in the back of the brain. • The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain. • They control vision. • Occipital lobe brain tumors can cause vision loss. • Brain tumors in the lower part of the brain. • The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain. • They process memories and senses. • Temporal lobe brain tumors can cause memory problems. • They might cause someone to see, taste or smell something that isn't there. • Sometimes the taste or smell is unpleasant or unusual. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have persistent signs and symptoms that worry you. • Brain tumors that start as a growth of cells in the brain are called primary brain tumors. • They might start right in the brain or in the tissue nearby. • Nearby tissue might include the membranes that cover the brain, called meninges. • Brain tumors also can happen in nerves, the pituitary gland and the pineal gland. • Brain tumors happen when cells in or near the brain get changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to grow quickly and continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This makes a lot of extra cells in the brain. • The cells can form a growth called a tumor. • It's not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to brain tumors. • For many people with brain tumors, the cause is never known. • Sometimes parents pass DNA changes to their children. • The changes can increase the risk of having a brain tumor. • These hereditary brain tumors are rare. • If you have a family history of brain tumors, talk about it with your health care provider. • You might consider meeting with a health care provider trained in genetics to understand whether your family history increases your risk of having a brain tumor. • When brain tumors happen in children, they're likely to be primary brain tumors. • In adults, brain tumors are more likely to be cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the brain. • Secondary brain tumors happen when cancer starts somewhere else and spreads to the brain. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • Any cancer can spread to the brain, but common types include: Breast cancer. • Colon cancer. • Kidney cancer. • Lung cancer. • Melanoma. • It's not clear why some cancers spread to the brain and others are more likely to spread to other places. • Secondary brain tumors most often happen in people who have a history of cancer. • Rarely, a brain tumor may be the first sign of cancer that began somewhere else in the body. • In adults, secondary brain tumors are far more common than are primary brain tumors. • In most people with primary brain tumors, the cause isn't clear. • But doctors have identified some factors that may raise the risk. • Risk factors include: Age. • Brain tumors can happen at any age, but they happen most often in older adults. • Some brain tumors mostly affect adults. • Some brain tumors happen most often in children. • Race. • Anyone can get a brain tumor. • But some types of brain tumors are more common in people of certain races. • For example, gliomas are more common in white people. • Meningiomas are more common in Black people. • Exposure to radiation. • People who have been exposed to a strong type of radiation have an increased risk of brain tumor. • This strong radiation is called ionizing radiation. • The radiation is strong enough to cause DNA changes in the body's cells. • The DNA changes can lead to tumors and cancers. • Examples of ionizing radiation include radiation therapy used to treat cancer and radiation exposure caused by atomic bombs. • Low-level radiation from everyday objects isn't linked to brain tumors. • Low levels of radiation include the energy that comes from cellphones and radio waves. • There is no convincing evidence that using cellphones causes brain tumors. • But more studies are happening to make sure. • Inherited syndromes that increase the risk of brain tumor. • Some DNA changes that increase the risk of brain tumor run in families. • Examples include the DNA changes that cause neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, Cowden syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome. • There's no way to prevent brain tumors. • If you get a brain tumor, you didn't do anything to cause it. • People with an increased risk of brain tumor might consider screening tests. • Screening isn't brain tumor prevention. • But screening might help find a brain tumor when it's small and treatment is more likely to be successful. • If you have a family history of brain tumor or inherited syndromes that increase the risk of brain tumor, talk about it with your health care provider. • You might consider meeting with a genetic counselor or other health care provider trained in genetics. • This person can help you understand your risk and ways to manage it. • For example, you might consider brain tumor screening tests. • Testing might include an imaging test or a neurological exam to test your vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes.",

      "Overview": "Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue. • After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. • But breast cancer doesn't just happen in women. • Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. • Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing. • And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down. • Much of this is due to the widespread support for breast cancer awareness and funding for research. • Advances in breast cancer screening allow healthcare professionals to diagnose breast cancer earlier. • Finding the cancer earlier makes it much more likely that the cancer can be cured. • Even when breast cancer can't be cured, many treatments exist to extend life. • New discoveries in breast cancer research are helping healthcare professionals choose the most effective treatment plans.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include: A breast lump or thickened area of skin that feels different from the surrounding tissue. • A nipple that looks flattened or turns inward. • Changes in the color of the breast skin. • In people with white skin, the breast skin may look pink or red. • In people with brown and Black skin, the breast skin may look darker than the other skin on the chest or it may look red or purple. • Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast. • Changes to the skin over the breast, such as skin that looks dimpled or looks like an orange peel. • Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the skin on the breast. • If you find a lump or other change in your breast, make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional. • Don't wait for your next mammogram to see if the change you found is breast cancer. • Report any changes in your breasts even if a recent mammogram showed there was no breast cancer. • The exact cause of most breast cancers isn't known. • Researchers have found things that increase the risk of breast cancer. • These include hormones, lifestyle choices and things in the environment. • But it's not clear why some people who don't have any factors get cancer, yet others with risk factors never do. • It's likely that breast cancer happens through a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and the world around you. • Healthcare professionals know that breast cancer starts when something changes the DNA inside cells in the breast tissue. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • The DNA changes that lead to breast cancer most often happen in the cells that line the milk ducts. • These ducts are tubes designed to carry milk to the nipple. • Breast cancer that starts in the ducts is called invasive ductal carcinoma. • Breast cancer also can start in cells in the milk glands. • These glands, called lobules, are designed to make breast milk. • Cancer that happens in the lobules is called invasive lobular carcinoma. • Other cells in the breast can become cancer cells, though this isn't common. • Factors that may increase the risk of breast cancer include: A family history of breast cancer. • If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. • The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. • Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. • A personal history of breast cancer. • If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. • A personal history of breast conditions. • Certain breast conditions are markers for a higher risk of breast cancer. • These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Beginning your period at a younger age. • Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer. • Beginning menopause at an older age. • Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. • Being female. • Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. • Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. • Dense breast tissue. • Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. • Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. • If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. • Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. • If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. • Drinking alcohol. • Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. • Having your first child at an older age. • Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Having never been pregnant. • Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. • Never having been pregnant increases the risk. • Increasing age. • The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older. • Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. • Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. • The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. • These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer. • Menopausal hormone therapy. • Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. • The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. • The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. • Obesity. • People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Radiation exposure. • If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher. • Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer. • Try to: Ask about breast cancer screening. • Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. • Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. • Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. • Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness. • You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. • If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. • Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. • But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. • This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. • For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. • So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. • Exercise most days of the week. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. • If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. • Limit menopausal hormone therapy. • Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. • Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. • These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable in order to get relief. • To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. • If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. • Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. • If you have a high risk of breast cancer, you might consider other options to lower the risk. • You might have a high risk if you have a family history of breast cancer. • Your risk also might be higher if you have a history of precancerous cells in the breast tissue. • Talk about your risk with your healthcare team. • Your team might have options for lowering your risk, such as: Preventive medicines. • Using estrogen-blocking medicines can lower the risk of breast cancer in those who have a high risk. • Options include medicines called selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors. • These medicines also are used as hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer. • These medicines carry a risk of side effects. • For this reason, they're only used in those who have a very high risk of breast cancer. • Discuss the benefits and risks with your healthcare team. • Preventive surgery. • If you have a very high risk of breast cancer, you may consider having surgery to lower the risk of breast cancer. • One option might be surgery to remove the breasts, called prophylactic mastectomy. • Another option is surgery to remove the ovaries, called prophylactic oophorectomy. • This operation lowers the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.",

      "Prevention": "Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer. • Try to: Ask about breast cancer screening. • Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. • Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. • Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. • Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness. • You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. • If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. • Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. • But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. • This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. • For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. • So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. • Exercise most days of the week. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. • If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. • Limit menopausal hormone therapy. • Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. • Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. • These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable in order to get relief. • To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. • If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. • Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. • If you have a high risk of breast cancer, you might consider other options to lower the risk. • You might have a high risk if you have a family history of breast cancer. • Your risk also might be higher if you have a history of precancerous cells in the breast tissue. • Talk about your risk with your healthcare team. • Your team might have options for lowering your risk, such as: Preventive medicines. • Using estrogen-blocking medicines can lower the risk of breast cancer in those who have a high risk. • Options include medicines called selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors. • These medicines also are used as hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer. • These medicines carry a risk of side effects. • For this reason, they're only used in those who have a very high risk of breast cancer. • Discuss the benefits and risks with your healthcare team. • Preventive surgery. • If you have a very high risk of breast cancer, you may consider having surgery to lower the risk of breast cancer. • One option might be surgery to remove the breasts, called prophylactic mastectomy. • Another option is surgery to remove the ovaries, called prophylactic oophorectomy. • This operation lowers the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer."

      "Overview": "Breast pain (mastalgia) can be described as tenderness, throbbing, sharp, stabbing, burning pain or tightness in the breast tissue. • The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people. • Breast pain can range from mild to severe. • It may occur: Just a few days a month, in the two to three days leading up to a menstrual period. • This normal, mild-to-moderate pain affects both breasts. • A week or longer each month, starting before a period and sometimes continuing through the menstrual cycle. • The pain may be moderate or severe, and affects both breasts. • Throughout the month, not related to a menstrual cycle. • In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called \"gynecomastia\" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). • This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that's caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. • Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. • In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. • In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy. • Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. • Unexplained breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn't seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.",
      "Symptoms": "Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. • Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. • Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. • Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics. • The term \"extramammary\" means \"outside the breast.\" Extramammary breast pain feels like it starts in the breast tissue, but its source is actually outside the breast area. • Pulling a muscle in the chest, for example, can cause pain in the chest wall or rib cage that spreads (radiates) to the breast. • Arthritis that involves the cartilage in the chest, also known as costochondritis, can also cause pain. • Make an appointment with your doctor if breast pain: Continues daily for more than a couple of weeks Occurs in one specific area of your breast Seems to be getting worse over time Interferes with daily activities Awakens you from sleep Breast cancer risk is very low in people whose main symptom is breast pain, but if your doctor recommends an evaluation, it's important to follow through. • Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands. • These changes in the ducts and glands can cause breast cysts, which can be painful and are a common cause of cyclic breast pain. • Noncyclic breast pain may be caused by trauma, prior breast surgery or other factors. • Sometimes, it's not possible to identify the exact cause of breast pain, but some factors may increase the risk. • Breast pain is more common among people who haven't completed menopause, although it may occur after menopause. • Breast pain can also occur in men who have gynecomastia, and in transgender people who are undergoing gender reassignment. • Other factors that may increase the risk of breast pain include: Breast size. • People who have large breasts may experience noncyclic breast pain related to the size of their breasts. • Neck, shoulder and back pain may accompany breast pain that's caused by large breasts. • Breast surgery. • Breast pain associated with breast surgery and scar formation can sometimes linger after incisions have healed. • Fatty acid imbalance. • An imbalance of fatty acids within the cells may affect the sensitivity of breast tissue to circulating hormones. • Medication use. • Certain hormonal medications, including some infertility treatments and oral birth control pills, may be associated with breast pain. • Breast tenderness is a possible side effect of estrogen and progesterone hormone therapies that are used after menopause. • Breast pain may be associated with certain antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. • Other medicines that can cause breast pain include those used to treat high blood pressure and some antibiotics. • Excessive caffeine use. • Although more research is needed, some people notice an improvement in breast pain when they reduce or eliminate caffeine. • The following steps may help prevent the causes of breast pain, although more research is needed to determine their effectiveness. • Avoid hormone therapy if possible. • Avoid medications that are known to cause breast pain or make it worse. • Wear a properly fitted bra, and wear a sports bra during exercise. • Try relaxation therapy, which can help control the high levels of anxiety associated with severe breast pain. • Limit or eliminate caffeine, a dietary change some people find helpful, although studies of caffeine's effect on breast pain and other premenstrual symptoms have been inconclusive. • Avoid excessive or prolonged lifting activities. • Follow a low-fat diet and eat more complex carbohydrates. • Consider using an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) — but ask your doctor how much to take, as long-term use may increase your risk of liver problems and other side effects.",

      "Overview": "A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in your arm — the ulna, radius and humerus. • One of the most common causes of a broken arm is falling onto an outstretched hand. • If you think you or your child has broken an arm, seek prompt medical attention. • It's important to treat a fracture as soon as possible for proper healing. • Treatment depends on the site and severity of the injury. • A simple break might be treated with a sling, ice and rest. • However, the bone may require realignment (reduction) in the emergency room. • A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.",
      "Symptoms": "A snap or cracking sound might be your first indication you've broken an arm. • Signs and symptoms include: Severe pain, which might increase with movement Swelling Bruising Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa If you have enough pain in your arm that you can't use it normally, see a doctor right away. • The same applies to your child. • Delays in diagnosis and treatment of a broken arm, especially for children, who heal faster than adults do, can lead to poor healing.",
      "Causes": "Common causes for a broken arm include: Falls. • Falling onto an outstretched hand or elbow is the most common cause of a broken arm. • Sports injuries. • Direct blows and injuries on the field or court cause all types of arm fractures. • Significant trauma. • Any of your arm bones can break during a car accident, bike accident or other direct trauma. • Child abuse. • In children, a broken arm might be the result of child abuse.",
      "Risk factors": "Certain medical conditions or physical activities can increase the risk of a broken arm. • Any sport that involves physical contact or increases your risk of falling — including football, soccer, gymnastics, skiing and skateboarding — also increases the risk of a broken arm. • Conditions that weaken bones, such as osteoporosis and bone tumors, increase your risk of a broken arm. • This type of break is known as a pathological fracture.",
      "Complications": "The prognosis for most arm fractures is very good if treated early. • But complications can include: Uneven growth. • Because a child's arm bones are still growing, a fracture in the area where growth occurs near each end of a long bone (growth plate) can interfere with that bone's growth. • Osteoarthritis. • Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis there years later. • Stiffness. • The immobilization required to heal a fracture in the upper arm bone can sometimes result in painfully limited range of motion of the elbow or shoulder. • Bone infection. • If a part of your broken bone protrudes through your skin, it can be exposed to germs that can cause infection. • Prompt treatment of this type of fracture is critical. • Nerve or blood vessel injury. • If the upper arm bone (humerus) fractures into two or more pieces, the jagged ends can injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. • Seek immediate medical attention if you notice numbness or circulation problems. • Compartment syndrome. • Excessive swelling of the injured arm can cut off the blood supply to part of the arm, causing pain and numbness. • Typically occurring 24 to 48 hours after the injury, compartment syndrome is a medical emergency that requires surgery.",
      "Prevention": "Although it's impossible to prevent an accident, these tips might offer some protection against bone breakage. • Eat for bone strength. • Eat a healthy diet that includes calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, and vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. • You can get vitamin D from fatty fish, such as salmon; from fortified foods, such as milk and orange juice; and from sun exposure. • Exercise for bone strength. • Weight-bearing physical activity and exercises that improve balance and posture can strengthen bones and reduce the chance of a fracture. • The more active and fit you are as you age, the less likely you are to fall and break a bone. • Prevent falls. • To prevent falling, wear sensible shoes. • Remove home hazards that can cause you to trip, such as area rugs. • Make sure your living space is well lit. • Install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary. • Use protective gear. • Wear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as in-line skating, snowboarding, rugby and football. • Don't smoke. • Smoking can increase your risk of a broken arm by reducing bone mass. • It also hampers healing of fractures."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a broken collarbone include: Pain that increases when moving the shoulder. • Swelling, tenderness or bruising. • Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched. • A bump on or near the shoulder. • A grinding or crackling sound when moving the shoulder. • Stiffness or not being able to move the shoulder. • Newborns often will not move their arm for days after breaking the collarbone during birth and will cry if someone moves the arm. • If you notice symptoms of a broken collarbone or enough pain to prevent using the arm as usual, see a health care provider right away. • Waiting to be treated can lead to poor healing.",
      "Causes": "Common causes of a broken collarbone include: Falls, such as falling onto the shoulder or onto an outstretched arm. • Sports injuries, such as a direct blow to the shoulder on the field, rink or court. • Traffic accidents, from a car, motorcycle or bike crash. • Birth injury, usually from a difficult vaginal birth.",
      "Risk factors": "Teenagers and children are at higher risk of a broken collarbone than are adults. • The risk goes down after age 20. • Then it rises again in older people as they lose bone strength with age.",
      "Complications": "Most broken collarbones heal without difficulty. • Complications, when they occur, might include: Nerve or blood vessel injury. • Rarely, the jagged ends of a broken collarbone may injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. • Seek immediate medical attention for numbness or coldness in an arm or hand. • Poor or slow healing. • A badly broken collarbone might heal slowly or not all the way. • Poor joining of the bones during healing can shorten the bone. • A lump in the bone. • As part of the healing process, the place where the bone knits together forms a bony lump. • The lump is easy to see because it's close to the skin. • Most lumps disappear over time, but not all. • Osteoarthritis. • A fracture that involves the joints that connect the collarbone to the shoulder blade or the breastbone might increase the risk of later developing arthritis in that joint."

      "Complications": "Complications of a broken foot bone aren't common but may include: Arthritis. • Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later. • If your foot starts to hurt long after a break, see your healthcare professional. • Bone infection, called osteomyelitis. • If you have an open fracture in which one end of the bone pokes through the skin, your bone may be exposed to bacteria that cause infection. • Nerve or blood vessel damage. • Trauma to the foot can injure or tear nerves and blood vessels. • Seek medical help right away if you notice numbness or feel like your foot isn't getting enough blood. • Lack of blood flow can cause a bone to die, called avascular necrosis. • Compartment syndrome. • This condition rarely occurs with foot fractures. • It causes pain, swelling, numbness and sometimes being unable to use the affected muscles of the foot.",
      "Prevention": "These sports and safety tips may help prevent a broken foot bone: Wear proper shoes. • Use hiking shoes on rough terrain. • Choose the right athletic shoes for your sport. • Replace athletic shoes when needed. • Get rid of shoes as soon as the tread or heel wears out or if the wear on the shoes isn't even. • If you're a runner, replace your shoes every 300 to 400 miles. • Start slowly. • That applies to a new fitness program and to every workout you do. • Have a balanced fitness program. • A balanced fitness program includes aerobic fitness to work your heart, strength training to build muscles and movements that put your joints through their full range of motion, called flexibility. • Build bone strength. • Get enough calcium and vitamin D. • Calcium-rich foods include dairy products, leafy greens and tofu. • Ask your healthcare professional if you need to take vitamin D supplements. • Use night lights. • Many broken toes are the result of walking in the dark. • Get rid of clutter in your home. • Keeping clutter off the floor can help you not trip and fall."

      "Overview": "Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. • The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. • Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. • But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed. • People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. • Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. • It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. • The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. • Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully. • Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart syndrome. • Broken heart syndrome also may be called: Stress cardiomyopathy. • Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. • Recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy. • Apical ballooning syndrome.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. • Symptoms may include: Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Any continued chest pain could be due to a heart attack. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have new or unexplained chest pain. • Also call if you have a very rapid or irregular heartbeat or shortness of breath. • The exact cause of broken heart syndrome is unclear. • It's thought that a surge of stress hormones, such as adrenaline, might damage the hearts of some people for a short time. • How these hormones might hurt the heart or whether something else is the cause isn't completely clear. • A temporary squeezing of the large or small arteries of the heart may play a role in the development of broken heart syndrome. • People who have broken heart syndrome also may have a change in the structure of the heart muscle. • An intense physical or emotional event often comes before broken heart syndrome. • Anything that causes a strong emotional reaction may trigger the condition. • Examples include: Sudden illness such as an asthma attack or COVID-19. • Major surgery. • Sudden broken bone. • Death of a loved one or other loss. • Strong argument. • Rarely, use of certain medicines or illegal drugs may lead to broken heart syndrome. • They include: Emergency medicines used to treat severe allergic reactions or severe asthma attacks. • Some medicines used to treat anxiety. • Medicines used to treat a stuffy nose. • Illegal stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine. • Always tell your healthcare team about the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. • When starting a new medicine, talk to your care team about the potential risks and side effects. • Heart attack is generally caused by a complete or near-complete blockage of a heart artery. • In broken heart syndrome, the heart arteries are not blocked. • But blood flow in the arteries of the heart may be reduced. • Risk factors for broken heart syndrome include: Sex. • Broken heart syndrome is more common in women than in men. • Age. • Most people who have broken heart syndrome are older than 50. • Mental health conditions. • People who have had or have anxiety or depression may have a higher risk of broken heart syndrome. • Most people who have broken heart syndrome quickly recover and usually don't have long-lasting effects. • But sometimes the condition comes back. • This is called recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy. • Rarely, broken heart syndrome can cause death. • Complications of broken heart syndrome include: Backup of fluid into the lungs, called pulmonary edema. • Low blood pressure. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Heart failure. • Blood clots in the heart. • To prevent another episode of broken heart syndrome, many healthcare professionals recommend long-term treatment with beta blockers or similar medicines. • These medicines block the potentially harmful effects of stress hormones on the heart. • Having chronic stress may increase the risk of broken heart syndrome. • Taking steps to manage emotional stress can improve heart health and may help prevent broken heart syndrome. • Some ways to reduce and manage stress include: Get more exercise. • Practice mindfulness. • Connect with others in support groups.",

      "Overview": "A broken leg (leg fracture) is a break or crack in one of the bones in your leg. • Common causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries. • Treatment of a broken leg depends on the location and severity of the injury. • A severely broken leg may require metal pins and plates to hold the fragments together. • Less severe breaks may be treated with a cast or splint. • In all cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to complete healing.",
      "Symptoms": "The thighbone (femur) is the strongest bone in the body. • It is usually obvious when the thighbone is broken because it takes so much force to break. • But a break in the shinbone (tibia) or in the bone that runs alongside the shinbone (fibula) may be less obvious. • Signs and symptoms of a broken leg may include: Severe pain, which may worsen with movement Swelling Tenderness Bruising Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg Inability to walk Toddlers or young children who break a leg may start limping or simply stop walking, even if they can't explain why. • If you or your child has any signs or symptoms of a broken leg, seek care right away. • Delays in diagnosis and treatment can result in problems later, including poor healing. • Seek emergency medical attention for any leg fracture from a high-impact trauma, such as a car or motorcycle accident. • Fractures of the thighbone are severe, potentially life-threatening injuries that require emergency medical services to help protect the area from further damage and to provide safe transfer to a local hospital.",
      "Causes": "A broken leg can be caused by: Falls. • A simple fall can fracture one or both lower leg bones. • A much higher impact is usually needed to break the thighbone. • Motor vehicle accidents. • All three leg bones can break during a motor vehicle accident. • Fractures can occur when your knees become jammed against the dashboard during a collision or with damage to the car hitting your legs. • Sports injuries. • Extending your leg beyond its natural limits during contact sports can cause a broken leg. • So can a fall or a direct blow — such as from a hockey stick or an opponent's body. • Child abuse. • In children, a broken leg may be the result of child abuse, especially when such an injury occurs before the child can walk. • Overuse. • Stress fractures are tiny cracks that develop in the weight-bearing bones of the body, including the shinbone. • Stress fractures are usually caused by repetitive force or overuse, such as running long distances. • But they can occur with regular use of a bone that's been weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.",
      "Risk factors": "Stress fractures are often the result of repetitive stress to the leg bones from physical activities, such as: Running Ballet dancing Basketball Marching Contact sports, such as hockey and football, also may pose a risk of direct blows to the leg, which can result in a fracture. • Stress fractures outside of sport situations are more common in people who have: Decreased bone density (osteoporosis) Diabetes Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "Complications": "Complications of a broken leg may include: Knee or ankle pain. • A broken bone in your leg may produce pain in your knee or ankle. • Bone infection (osteomyelitis). • If a broken bone cuts through the skin and causes a wound, it is called an open fracture. • If you have an open fracture, the bone may be exposed to germs that can cause infection. • Poor or delayed healing. • A severe leg fracture may not heal quickly or completely. • This is particularly common in an open fracture of the tibia because of lower blood flow to this bone. • Nerve or blood vessel damage. • Leg fractures can injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. • Seek immediate medical help if you notice any numbness, pale skin or circulation problems. • Compartment syndrome. • This condition causes pain, swelling and sometimes disability in muscles near the broken bone. • This is a rare complication that is more common with high-impact injuries, such as a car or motorcycle accident. • Arthritis. • Fractures that extend into the joint and poor bone alignment can cause osteoarthritis years later. • If your leg starts to hurt long after a break, see your health care provider for an evaluation. • Unequal leg length. • The long bones of a child grow from the ends of the bones, in softer areas called growth plates. • If a fracture goes through a growth plate, that limb might eventually become shorter or longer than the opposite limb.",
      "Prevention": "A broken leg can't always be prevented. • But these basic tips may reduce your risk: Build bone strength. • Calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, can help build strong bones. • A calcium or vitamin D supplement also may improve bone strength. • Ask your health care provider if these supplements are right for you. • Wear proper athletic shoes. • Choose the appropriate shoe for your favorite sports or activities. • And replace athletic shoes regularly. • Discard sneakers as soon as the tread or heel wears out or if the shoes are wearing unevenly. • Cross-train. • Alternating activities can prevent stress fractures. • Rotate running with swimming or biking. • If you run on a sloped track indoors, alternate the direction of your running to even out the stress on your skeleton."

      "Overview": "Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants. • It causes swelling and irritation and a buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. • These small airways are called bronchioles. • Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus. • Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms much like a common cold. • But then it gets worse, causing coughing and a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out called wheezing. • Sometimes children have trouble breathing. • Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer. • Most children get better with care at home. • A small number of children need a stay in the hospital.",
      "Symptoms": "For the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold: Runny nose. • Stuffy nose. • Cough. • Sometimes a slight fever. • Later, your child may have a week or more of working harder than usual to breathe, which may include wheezing. • Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media. • If symptoms become serious, call your child's health care provider. • This is especially important if your child is younger than 12 weeks old or has other risk factors for bronchiolitis — for example, being born too early, also called premature, or having a heart condition. • Get medical attention right away if your child has any of these symptoms: Has blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels. • Struggles to breathe and can't speak or cry. • Refuses to drink enough, or breathes too fast to eat or drink. • Breathes very fast — in infants this can be more than 60 breaths a minute — with short, shallow breaths. • Can't breathe easily and the ribs seem to suck inward when breathing in. • Makes wheezing sounds when breathing. • Makes grunting noises with each breath. • Appears slow moving, weak or very tired. • Bronchiolitis happens when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in the lungs. • The infection makes the bronchioles swollen and irritated. • Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs. • Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). • RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by 2 years of age. • Outbreaks of RSV infection often happen during the colder months of the year in some locations or the rainy season in others. • A person can get it more than once. • Bronchiolitis also can be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold. • The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread. • You can get them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. • You also can get them by touching shared items — such as dishes, doorknobs, towels or toys — and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. • Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2 years. • Infants younger than 3 months have the highest risk of getting bronchiolitis because their lungs and their ability to fight infections aren't yet fully developed. • Rarely, adults can get bronchiolitis. • Other factors that increase the risk of bronchiolitis in infants and young children include: Being born too early. • Having a heart or lung condition. • Having a weakened immune system. • This makes it hard to fight infections. • Being around tobacco smoke. • Contact with lots of other children, such as in a child care setting. • Spending time in crowded places. • Having siblings who go to school or get child care services and bring home the infection. • Complications of severe bronchiolitis may include: Low oxygen in the body. • Pauses in breathing, which is most likely to happen in babies born too early and in babies under 2 months old. • Not being able to drink enough liquids. • This can cause dehydration, when too much body fluid is lost. • Not being able to get the amount of oxygen needed. • This is called respiratory failure. • If any of these happen, your child may need to be in the hospital. • Severe respiratory failure may require that a tube be guided into the windpipe. • This helps your child breathe until the infection improves. • Because the viruses that cause bronchiolitis spread from person to person, one of the best ways to prevent infection is to wash your hands often. • This is especially important before touching your baby when you have a cold, flu or other illness that can be spread. • If you have any of these illnesses, wear a face mask. • If your child has bronchiolitis, keep your child at home until the illness is past to avoid spreading it to others. • To help prevent infection: Limit contact with people who have a fever or cold. • If your child is a newborn, especially a premature newborn, avoid being around people with colds. • This is especially important in the first two months of life. • Clean and disinfect surfaces. • Clean and disinfect surfaces and items that people often touch, such as toys and doorknobs. • This is especially important if a family member is sick. • Wash hands often. • Frequently wash your own hands and those of your child. • Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • Keep an alcohol-based hand sanitizer handy to use when you're away from home. • Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. • Cover coughs and sneezes. • Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. • Throw away the tissue. • Then wash your hands. • If soap and water aren't available, use a hand sanitizer. • If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. • Use your own drinking glass. • Don't share glasses with others, especially if someone in your family is ill. • Breastfeed, when possible. • Respiratory infections are less common in breastfed babies. • In the U.S., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children who are less than a year old. • Two options for immunization can help prevent young infants from getting severe RSV. • Both are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and others. • You and your healthcare professional should discuss which option is best to protect your child: Antibody product called nirsevimab (Beyfortus). • This antibody product is a single-dose shot given in the month before or during RSV season. • It's for newborn babies and those younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. • In the U.S., the RSV season typically is November through March, but it varies in Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. • Pacific Island territories. • Nirsevimab also should be given to children 8 months through 19 months old who are at higher risk of severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. • Higher risk conditions include: Children with active chronic lung disease from being born too soon (prematurely). • Children with a severely weakened immune system. • Children with severe cystic fibrosis. • American Indian or Alaska Native children. • In rare situations, when nirsevimab is not available or a child is not eligible for it, another antibody product called palivizumab may be given. • But palivizumab requires monthly shots given during the RSV season, while nirsevimab is only one shot. • Palivizumab is not recommended for healthy children or adults. • Vaccine for pregnant people. • The FDA approved an RSV vaccine called Abrysvo for pregnant people to prevent RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of age. • A single-dose shot of Abrysvo can be given sometime from 32 weeks through 36 weeks of pregnancy during September through January in the U.S. • Abrysvo is not recommended for infants or children. • Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis too. • These include COVID-19 and influenza or flu. • Getting seasonal COVID-19 and flu shots every year is recommended for everyone older than 6 months.",
      "Causes": "Bronchiolitis happens when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in the lungs. • The infection makes the bronchioles swollen and irritated. • Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs. • Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). • RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by 2 years of age. • Outbreaks of RSV infection often happen during the colder months of the year in some locations or the rainy season in others. • A person can get it more than once. • Bronchiolitis also can be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold. • The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread. • You can get them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. • You also can get them by touching shared items — such as dishes, doorknobs, towels or toys — and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.",
      "Risk factors": "Bronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2 years. • Infants younger than 3 months have the highest risk of getting bronchiolitis because their lungs and their ability to fight infections aren't yet fully developed. • Rarely, adults can get bronchiolitis. • Other factors that increase the risk of bronchiolitis in infants and young children include: Being born too early. • Having a heart or lung condition. • Having a weakened immune system. • This makes it hard to fight infections. • Being around tobacco smoke. • Contact with lots of other children, such as in a child care setting. • Spending time in crowded places. • Having siblings who go to school or get child care services and bring home the infection.",
      "Complications": "Complications of severe bronchiolitis may include: Low oxygen in the body. • Pauses in breathing, which is most likely to happen in babies born too early and in babies under 2 months old. • Not being able to drink enough liquids. • This can cause dehydration, when too much body fluid is lost. • Not being able to get the amount of oxygen needed. • This is called respiratory failure. • If any of these happen, your child may need to be in the hospital. • Severe respiratory failure may require that a tube be guided into the windpipe. • This helps your child breathe until the infection improves.",
      "Prevention": "Because the viruses that cause bronchiolitis spread from person to person, one of the best ways to prevent infection is to wash your hands often. • This is especially important before touching your baby when you have a cold, flu or other illness that can be spread. • If you have any of these illnesses, wear a face mask. • If your child has bronchiolitis, keep your child at home until the illness is past to avoid spreading it to others. • To help prevent infection: Limit contact with people who have a fever or cold. • If your child is a newborn, especially a premature newborn, avoid being around people with colds. • This is especially important in the first two months of life. • Clean and disinfect surfaces. • Clean and disinfect surfaces and items that people often touch, such as toys and doorknobs. • This is especially important if a family member is sick. • Wash hands often. • Frequently wash your own hands and those of your child. • Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • Keep an alcohol-based hand sanitizer handy to use when you're away from home. • Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol. • Cover coughs and sneezes. • Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. • Throw away the tissue. • Then wash your hands. • If soap and water aren't available, use a hand sanitizer. • If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. • Use your own drinking glass. • Don't share glasses with others, especially if someone in your family is ill. • Breastfeed, when possible. • Respiratory infections are less common in breastfed babies. • In the U.S., respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children who are less than a year old. • Two options for immunization can help prevent young infants from getting severe RSV. • Both are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and others. • You and your healthcare professional should discuss which option is best to protect your child: Antibody product called nirsevimab (Beyfortus). • This antibody product is a single-dose shot given in the month before or during RSV season. • It's for newborn babies and those younger than 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season. • In the U.S., the RSV season typically is November through March, but it varies in Florida, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and other U.S. • Pacific Island territories. • Nirsevimab also should be given to children 8 months through 19 months old who are at higher risk of severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. • Higher risk conditions include: Children with active chronic lung disease from being born too soon (prematurely). • Children with a severely weakened immune system. • Children with severe cystic fibrosis. • American Indian or Alaska Native children. • In rare situations, when nirsevimab is not available or a child is not eligible for it, another antibody product called palivizumab may be given. • But palivizumab requires monthly shots given during the RSV season, while nirsevimab is only one shot. • Palivizumab is not recommended for healthy children or adults. • Vaccine for pregnant people. • The FDA approved an RSV vaccine called Abrysvo for pregnant people to prevent RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of age. • A single-dose shot of Abrysvo can be given sometime from 32 weeks through 36 weeks of pregnancy during September through January in the U.S. • Abrysvo is not recommended for infants or children. • Other viruses can cause bronchiolitis too. • These include COVID-19 and influenza or flu. • Getting seasonal COVID-19 and flu shots every year is recommended for everyone older than 6 months."

      "Overview": "Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. • These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. • People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. • Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). • Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. • Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. • Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. • If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. • Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
      "Symptoms": "If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as: Cough Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood Sore throat Mild headache and body aches Slight fever and chills Fatigue Chest discomfort Shortness of breath and wheezing While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. • For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: Cough Production of mucus Fatigue Chest discomfort Shortness of breath Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. • If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. • It's also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. • Contact your doctor or clinic for advice if your cough: Is accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C). • Produces blood. • Is associated with serious or worsening shortness of breath or wheezing. • Includes other serious signs and symptoms, for example, you appear pale and lethargic, have a bluish tinge to your lips and nail beds, or have trouble thinking clearly or concentrating. • Lasts more than three weeks. • Before you go in, your doctor or clinic can give you guidance on how to prepare for your appointment. • Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). • Many different viruses — all of which are very contagious — can cause acute bronchitis. • Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis. • Viruses spread mainly from person to person by droplets produced when an ill person coughs, sneezes or talks and you inhale the droplets. • Viruses may also spread through contact with an infected object. • This happens when you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose. • The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. • Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition. • Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: Cigarette smoke. • People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis. • Low resistance. • This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. • Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection. • Exposure to irritants on the job. • Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes. • Gastric reflux. • Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis. • Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn't cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. • Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). • To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips: Get an annual flu shot. • Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. • Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. • Also ask your doctor or clinic if you need a vaccination that protects against certain types of pneumonia. • Wash your hands. • To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. • Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. • Avoid close contact with people who have a viral infection. • Stay away from people who have the flu or another respiratory illness. • Avoid cigarette smoke. • Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis. • Wear appropriate face covering. • If you have COPD, consider wearing a face mask at work if you're exposed to dust or fumes. • Talk to your employer about the appropriate protection. • Wearing a face mask when you're going to be among crowds helps reduce exposure to infections.",

      "Overview": "Buerger disease is a rare disease of the arteries and veins in the arms and legs. • In Buerger disease — also called thromboangiitis obliterans — blood vessels become blocked. • This reduces blood flow to the affected areas. • Blood clots may form in the blood vessels. • Over time, the lack of blood flow damages or destroys skin tissue. • The damage can lead to infection and death of body tissue, called gangrene. • Buerger disease is usually first seen in the feet. • It may eventually affect the blood vessels of the hand. • Blood clots may form in the small veins of the arms and legs. • People who get Buerger disease almost always smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco, such as chewing tobacco. • Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger disease. • For those who don't quit, surgery to remove fingers and toes might be needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Buerger disease symptoms include: Tingling or numbness in the fingers or toes. • Changes in skin color in the hands and feet. • The skin may look pale gray, red or blue. • Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. • Fingers and toes that turn white then blue when exposed to cold, known as Raynaud's disease. • Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. • Pain in the feet that occurs with walking. • The pain may make it difficult to walk long distances. • Painful open sores on fingers and toes. • Pain in the fingers and toes may become severe and occur at rest. • Inflammation of a vein just below the skin's surface, due to a blood clot in the vein. • See a health care provider if you think you have symptoms of Buerger disease.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of Buerger disease is unknown. • The condition is strongly linked to tobacco use. • It's thought that chemicals in tobacco may hurt the lining of the blood vessels. • Experts think that some people have genes that make them more likely to get Buerger disease. • It's also possible that the disease occurs when the body's immune system attacks healthy tissue by mistake.",
      "Risk factors": "The biggest risk factor for Buerger disease is smoking or using any type of tobacco. • The disease can occur in people who smoke cigarettes, use cigars and chew tobacco. • The rates of Buerger disease are highest in areas of the Mediterranean, Middle East and Asia where heavy smoking is most common. • Some research says that long-term use of marijuana, also called cannabis, also raises the risk of blood vessel problems similar to those of Buerger disease. • Other risk factors for Buerger disease include being male and being younger than 45 years old. • Long-term infection of the gums in the mouth may also increase the risk. • But more study is needed to confirm this link.",
      "Complications": "Buerger disease decreases blood flow to the hands and feet. • As the disease gets worse, the skin and tissue in the affected areas do not get enough blood. • This can cause painful open sores that do not heal. • The sores may lead to a complication called gangrene. • Symptoms of gangrene include black or blue skin, a loss of feeling in the affected finger or toe, and a bad smell from the area. • Gangrene is a serious condition. • Surgery is usually needed to remove the affected finger, toe or other tissue.",
      "Prevention": "Nearly everyone who has Buerger disease has smoked or used some form of tobacco. • To prevent Buerger disease, it's important to not use tobacco. • Quitting smoking can be hard. • Talk to a health care provider about ways to quit."

      "Overview": "Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. • People with bulimia binge eat. • This means people feel like they've lost control over their eating. • They eat large amounts of food in one sitting. • This often occurs in secret, and they often feel very guilty and shameful. • Then they try to get rid of the food and extra calories in an unhealthy way, such as vomiting or misusing laxatives. • This is called purging. • If you have bulimia, you probably focus on your weight and body shape even when you're trying to think about other things. • You may judge yourself severely and harshly for what you see as flaws in your appearance and personality. • Bulimia is related to how you see yourself — not just about food. • It can be hard to overcome, and it can be dangerous. • It's important to remember that an eating disorder is not something you choose. • Bulimia is a complex illness that affects how your brain works and how you make decisions. • But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, eat healthier and reverse serious complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Bulimia symptoms may include: Living in fear of gaining weight and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways. • Repeatedly eating unusually large amounts of food in one sitting. • Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. • You may feel like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat. • Vomiting on purpose or exercising to extremes after binge eating so that you don't gain weight. • Using medicines that make you urinate, called water pills or diuretics, or laxatives or enemas to pass stool when they're not needed. • Fasting, limiting calories or not eating certain foods between binges. • Using dietary supplements or herbal products for weight loss. • These products can be dangerous. • Being very unhappy with your body shape and weight. • Letting your body shape and weight guide how you feel about yourself and your worth. • Having extreme mood swings. • People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. • The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so. • If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help right away. • If left untreated, bulimia can severely affect your physical and mental health. • Talk to your primary healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your bulimia symptoms and feelings. • If you're not sure if you want to seek treatment, talk to someone about what you're going through. • This could be a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. • This person can help you take the first steps to get help. • If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, talk with the person openly and honestly about your concerns. • You can't force someone to get help, but you can give encouragement and support. • You also can help find a healthcare professional or mental health professional, make an appointment, and even offer to go along to the appointment. • People with bulimia can be at any weight. • For example, they could be average weight or overweight. • That's why you can't tell just by looking at someone's size whether that person has bulimia. • Signs of bulimia that family and friends may notice include: Always worrying about eating or being overweight. • Having a distorted or negative body image or both. • Eating unusually large amounts of food over and over again in one sitting. • Following a strict diet or fasting after binge eating. • Having acid reflux, a hard time passing stool and other stomach problems. • Not wanting to eat in public or in front of others. • Going to the bathroom right after eating or during mealtime, or for long periods. • Exercising a lot. • Having sores, scars or calluses on the knuckles or hands. • Having damaged teeth and gums. • Changing weight — up and down. • Swelling in the hands and feet, and cheeks and jaw area. • The exact cause of bulimia is not known. • Genes may play a role in the development of bulimia and other eating disorders. • Emotional health and family history may play a role. • Also, pressures from society to be thin may play a role. • Females are more likely to have bulimia than males. • Bulimia often begins in the late teens or young adulthood. • Factors that raise your risk of bulimia include: Family history and genes. • Having a family history of eating problems and weight-control issues can increase the risk of an eating disorder. • People with first-degree relatives — siblings, parents or children — who are diagnosed with an eating disorder may be more likely to have an eating disorder. • This suggests a possible genetic link. • Mental health and emotional issues. • Mental health and emotional problems, such as depression, anxiety or substance misuse, are linked closely with eating disorders. • People with bulimia may feel badly about themselves, especially if they're bullied about weight or shape. • In some cases, distressing events and factors that cause emotional distress may play a part, such as being mistreated as a child. • Dieting. • People who diet are more likely to have eating disorders. • Many people with bulimia severely limit calories between binge-eating sessions. • This may cause them to binge eat again and then purge. • Other causes for binge eating can include stress, strong emotions, having a distorted or negative body image and boredom. • Bulimia may cause many serious and even life-threatening complications, including: Not seeing yourself as worthy and feeling hopeless or even suicidal. • Problems getting along with others or being socially isolated. • Poor nutrition. • Not drinking enough fluids, which can lead to major medical problems, such as kidney failure. • Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or heart failure. • Severe tooth decay and gum disease. • Not having a period or not having a period on a regular schedule. • Gastrointestinal problems, including tears in the tube that carries food, or a hole in your stomach or small intestine. • You also could have rectal prolapse, which is when part of the large intestine slips outside the anus. • Conditions that often occur along with bulimia include anxiety, depression, personality disorders or bipolar disorder, and misuse of alcohol or drugs. • Self-harm, thoughts about suicide or suicide also can occur. • Although there's no sure way to prevent bulimia, you can steer someone toward healthier behavior or professional treatment before it gets worse. • Here's how you can help: Promote and support a healthy body image in your children, no matter what their size or shape. • Help them become more confident in many parts of their personality, not just how they look. • Have regular, enjoyable family meals. • Don't talk about weight or shape at home. • Discourage dieting. • This is especially important when it involves unhealthy weight-control behaviors, such as fasting, labeling foods as good or bad, using weight-loss supplements or laxatives, or vomiting. • Talk with your primary healthcare professional to look for early signs of an eating problem. • If you notice a loved one or friend who seems to have food issues that could lead to or suggest an eating disorder, think about talking to the person about these issues and ask how you can help. • If you do so, be supportive.",

      "Overview": "Burns are tissue damage that results from too much sun, hot liquids, flames, chemicals, electricity, steam and other sources. • Burns can be minor medical problems or life-threatening emergencies. • The treatment of burns depends on where they are on the body and how bad they are. • Sunburns and small scalds can often be treated with first aid. • Deep or widespread burns and chemical or electrical burns need medical care right away. • Some people need treatment at specialized burn centers and monthslong follow-up care.",
      "Symptoms": "Burn symptoms vary depending on how deep the skin damage is. • It can take a day or two for the symptoms of a severe burn to develop. • First-degree burn, also called superficial burn. • This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin, which is called the epidermis. • It may cause pain and redness or other changes in skin color. • Second-degree burn, also called partial-thickness burn. • This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin, which is called the dermis. • It may cause swelling and red, white or splotchy skin. • Blisters may develop, and pain can be terrible. • Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring. • Third-degree burn, also called full-thickness burn. • This burn involves all of the layers of skin and sometimes the fat and muscle tissue under the skin. • Burned areas may be black, brown or white. • The skin may look leathery. • Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, so there may be little or no pain. • Call 911 or seek immediate care for: Burns that may be deep, involving all layers of the skin. • Burns that cause the skin to be dry and leathery. • Burns that look charred or have patches of white, brown or black. • Burns that are larger than 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) wide. • Burns that cover the hands, feet, face, neck, groin, buttocks or a major joint, or burns that encircle an arm or a leg. •

such as oozing and streaks from the wound, and fever. • A burn or blister that's wider than 2 inches (about 5 centimeters) or doesn't heal in two weeks. • New symptoms that can't be explained. • A burn and also have a history diabetes. • Also call your health professional if you think you might need a tetanus booster. • You may need a booster shot if you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past five years. • Try to get this within three days of the injury. • Burns are caused by: Fire. • Hot liquid or steam. • Hot metal, glass or other objects. • Electrical currents. • Nonsolar radiation, such as that from X-rays. • Sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet radiation, such as tanning beds. • Chemicals such as strong acids, lye, paint thinner or gasoline. • Abuse. • Risk factors for burns include: Workplace factors. • People who work outdoors and people who work with flames, chemicals and other substances that cause burns are at increased risk of burns. • Most burns occur in adults. • Dementia. • Older adults with dementia are more likely to have burns from heat sources, such as too-hot tap water, hot drinks, food fats and cooking oils. • Being young. • Very young children are unable to get away from heat sources or flames. • Their burns often come from kitchen, car seat and bath hazards. • Alcohol. • Risk of burns is increased among people who drink alcohol or use other substances that affect judgment. • Complications of deep or widespread burns can include: Infection. • Examples include bacterial infection, tetanus, and pneumonia. • Fluid loss. • This includes low blood volume, which is also known as hypovolemia. • Dangerously low body temperature. • This is known as hypothermia. • Breathing problems. • These can occur after taking in hot air or smoke. • Irregular heartbeats. • Also called arrythmias, irregular heartbeats can occur after electrical burns. • Scars and changes in skin color. • Scars or ridged areas can be caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue. • These types of scars are called hypertrophic scars or keloids. • Black people have an increased risk of this type of scarring and may benefit from seeing a burn specialist or surgeon. • Other people may develop skin color changes after burns if healed skin is lighter or darker than skin that wasn't burned. • Pain. • Burn scars can be painful. • Some people may experience itching or discomfort related to damaged nerves, causing numbness or tingling. • Bone and joint problems. • Scar tissue can shorten and tighten skin, muscles or tendons. • This condition is also known as a contracture. • Depression and anxiety disorders. • Skin cancer. • Skin cancer can sometimes happen in scars from previous burns. • Contact your healthcare professional if you notice a

      "Overview": "Bursitis (bur-SY-tis) is a painful condition that affects the small, fluid-filled sacs — called bursae (bur-SEE) — that cushion the bones, tendons and muscles near your joints. • Bursitis occurs when bursae become inflamed. • The most common locations for bursitis are in the shoulder, elbow and hip. • But you can also have bursitis by your knee, heel and the base of your big toe. • Bursitis often occurs near joints that perform frequent repetitive motion. • Treatment typically involves resting the affected joint and protecting it from further trauma. • In most cases, bursitis pain goes away within a few weeks with proper treatment, but recurrent flare-ups of bursitis are common.",
      "Symptoms": "If you have bursitis, the affected joint might: Feel achy or stiff Hurt more when you move it or press on it Look swollen and red Consult your doctor if you have: Disabling joint pain Sudden inability to move a joint Excessive swelling, redness, bruising or a rash in the affected area Sharp or shooting pain, especially when you exercise or exert yourself A fever The most common causes of bursitis are repetitive motions or positions that put pressure on the bursae around a joint. • Examples include: Throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head repeatedly Leaning on your elbows for long periods Extensive kneeling for tasks such as laying carpet or scrubbing floors Other causes include injury or trauma to the affected area, inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and infection. • Anyone can develop bursitis, but certain factors can increase your risk: Age. • Bursitis becomes more common with aging. • Occupations or hobbies. • If your work or hobby requires repetitive motion or pressure on particular bursae, your risk of developing bursitis increases. • Examples include carpet laying, tile setting, gardening, painting and playing a musical instrument. • Other medical conditions. • Certain systemic diseases and conditions — such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes — increase your risk of developing bursitis. • Being overweight can increase your risk of developing hip and knee bursitis. • While not all types of bursitis can be prevented, you can reduce your risk and the severity of flare-ups by changing the way you do certain tasks. • Examples include: Using kneeling pads. • Use some type of padding to reduce the pressure on your knees if your job or hobby requires a lot of kneeling. • Lifting properly. • Bend your knees when you lift. • Failing to do so puts extra stress on the bursae in your hips. • Wheeling heavy loads. • Carrying heavy loads puts stress on the bursae in your shoulders. • Use a dolly or a wheeled cart instead. • Taking frequent breaks. • Alternate repetitive tasks with rest or other activities. • Maintaining a healthy weight. • Being overweight places more stress on your joints. • Exercising. • Strengthening your muscles can help protect your affected joint. • Warming up and stretching before strenuous activities to protect your joints from injury.",
