      "Overview": "Clostridioides difficile (klos-TRID-e-oi-deez dif-uh-SEEL) is a bacterium that causes an infection of the colon, the longest part of the large intestine. • Symptoms can range from diarrhea to life-threatening damage to the colon. • The bacterium is often called C. difficile or C. diff. • Illness from C. difficile often occurs after using antibiotic medicines. • It mostly affects older adults in hospitals or in long-term care settings. • People not in care settings or hospitals also can get C. difficile infection. • Some strains of the bacterium that can cause serious infections are more likely to affect younger people. • The bacterium used to be called Clostridium (klos-TRID-e-um) difficile.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms often begin within 5 to 10 days after starting an antibiotic. • But symptoms can occur as soon as the first day or up to three months later. • The most common symptoms of mild to moderate C. difficile infection are: Watery diarrhea three or more times a day for more than one day. • Mild belly cramping and tenderness. • People who have a severe C. difficile infection tend to lose too much bodily fluid, a condition called dehydration. • They might need to be treated in a hospital for dehydration. • C. difficile infection can cause the colon to become inflamed. • It sometimes can form patches of raw tissue that can bleed or make pus. • Symptoms of severe infection include: Watery diarrhea as often as 10 to 15 times a day. • Belly cramping and pain, which may be severe. • Fast heart rate. • Loss of fluids, called dehydration. • Fever. • Nausea. • Increased white blood cell count. • Kidney failure. • Loss of appetite. • Swollen belly. • Weight loss. • Blood or pus in the stool. • C. difficile infection that is severe and sudden can cause the colon to become inflamed and get larger, called toxic megacolon. • And it can cause a condition called sepsis where the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. • People who have toxic megacolon or sepsis are admitted to an intensive care unit in the hospital. • But toxic megacolon and sepsis aren't common with a C. difficile infection. • Some people have loose stools during or shortly after antibiotic therapy. • This may be caused by C. difficile infection. • Make a health care appointment if you have: Three or more watery stools a day. • Symptoms lasting more than two days. • A new fever. • Severe belly pain or cramping. • Blood in your stool. • C. difficile bacteria enter the body through the mouth. • They can begin reproducing in the small intestine. • When they reach the part of the large intestine, called the colon, the bacteria can release toxins that damage tissues. • These toxins destroy cells and cause watery diarrhea. • Outside the colon, the bacteria aren't active. • They can live for a long time in places such as: Human or animal feces. • Surfaces in a room. • Unwashed hands. • Soil. • Water. • Food, including meat. • When bacteria once again find their way into a person's digestive system, they become active again and cause infection. • Because C. difficile can live outside the body, the bacteria spread easily. • Not washing hands or cleaning well make it easy to spread the bacteria. • Some people carry C. difficile bacteria in their intestines but never get sick from it. • These people are carriers of the bacteria. • They can spread infections without being sick. • People who have no known risk factors have gotten sick from C. difficile. • But certain factors increase the risk. • The intestines house a wide range of bacteria. • Many of them help protect the body from infection. • Antibiotics that treat an infection tend to destroy some of the helpful bacteria in the body as well as the bacteria causing the infection. • Without enough helpful bacteria to keep it in check, C. difficile can grow out of control quickly. • Any antibiotic can cause C. difficile infection. • But the antibiotics that most often lead to C. difficile infection include: Clindamycin. • Cephalosporins. • Penicillins. • Fluoroquinolones. • Taking a proton pump inhibitor, a type of medicine used to cut stomach acid, also may increase the risk of C. difficile infection. • Most C. difficile infections occur in people who are in or have recently been in health care settings. • These include hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities. • These are places where germs spread easily, antibiotic use is common and people's health puts them at high risk of getting an infection. • In hospitals and nursing homes, C. difficile spreads on: Hands. • Cart handles. • Bedrails. • Bedside tables. • Toilets and sinks. • Stethoscopes, thermometers or other medical tools. • Telephones. • Remote controls. • Certain medical conditions or procedures can up the risk of getting a C. difficile infection, including: Inflammatory bowel disease. • Weakened immune system from a medical condition or treatment such as chemotherapy. • Chronic kidney disease. • Procedures on the digestive tract. • Other surgery of the stomach area. • Older age is a risk factor. • In one study, the risk of becoming infected with C. difficile was 10 times greater for people age 65 and older compared with younger people. • Having one C. difficile infection increases the chance of having another one. • The risk increases with each infection. • Complications of C. difficile infection include: Loss of fluids, called dehydration. • Severe diarrhea can lead to a serious loss of fluids and minerals called electrolytes. • This makes it hard for the body to work as it should. • It can cause blood pressure to drop so low as to be dangerous. • Kidney failure. • In some cases, dehydration can occur so quickly that the kidneys stop working, called kidney failure. • Toxic megacolon. • In this rare condition, the colon can't get rid of gas and stool. • This causes it to enlarge, called megacolon. • Untreated, the colon can burst. • Bacteria also may enter the bloodstream. • Toxic megacolon may be fatal. • It needs emergency surgery. • A hole in the large intestine, called bowel perforation. • This rare condition results from damage to the lining of the colon or occurs after toxic megacolon. • Bacteria spilling from the colon into the hollow space in the middle of the body, called the abdominal cavity, can lead to a life-threatening infection called peritonitis. • Death. • Serious C. difficile infection can quickly become fatal if not treated promptly. • Rarely, death can occur with mild to moderate infection. • To protect against C. difficile, don't take antibiotics unless you need them. • Sometimes, you may get a prescription for antibiotics to treat conditions not caused by bacteria, such as viral illnesses. • Antibiotics don't help infections caused by viruses. • If you need an antibiotic, ask if you can get a prescription for a medicine that you take for a shorter time or is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. • Narrow-spectrum antibiotics target a limited number of bacteria types. • They're less likely to affect healthy bacteria. • To help prevent the spread of C. difficile, hospitals and other health care settings follow strict rules to control infections. • If you have a loved one in a hospital or nursing home, follow the rules. • Ask questions if you see caregivers or other people not following the rules. • Measures to prevent C. difficile include: Hand-washing. • Health care workers should make sure their hands are clean before and after treating each person in their care. • For a C. difficile outbreak, using soap and warm water is better for cleaning hands. • Alcohol-based hand sanitizers don't destroy C. difficile spores. • Visitors to health care facilities also should wash their hands with soap and warm water before and after leaving rooms or using the bathroom. • Contact precautions. • People who are hospitalized with C. difficile infection have a private room or share a room with someone who has the same illness. • Hospital staff and visitors wear disposable gloves and isolation gowns while in the room. • Thorough cleaning. • In any health care setting, all surfaces should be carefully disinfected with a product that has chlorine bleach. • C. difficile spores can survive cleaning products that don't have bleach.",

      "Overview": "Calciphylaxis (kal-sih-fuh-LAK-sis) is a rare, serious disease. • It involves a buildup of calcium in small blood vessels of fat tissues and skin. • Calciphylaxis symptoms include blood clots, lumps under the skin and painful open sores called ulcers. • If an ulcer becomes infected, it can be life-threatening. • The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't clear. • But people with the disease usually have kidney failure. • That's a condition in which the kidneys no longer work as they should. • Often, these same people also have received kidney failure treatments such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. • Calciphylaxis can happen in people without kidney disease too. • Calciphylaxis treatments include various medicines, procedures and surgery. • Treatment can help prevent blood clots and infections, reduce calcium buildups, heal sores, and ease pain.",
      "Symptoms": "Calciphylaxis symptoms include: Large netlike patterns on the skin that may look purple-pink in color. • Deep, painful lumps in the skin that can become ulcers. • The ulcers often have a black-brown crust that doesn't heal on its own. • Ulcers tend to appear in areas with high fat content, such as the stomach, thighs, buttocks and breasts. • But they can form anywhere. • Infections from ulcers that don't heal.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't known. • The disease involves the buildup of calcium in the smallest parts of the arteries in fat tissues and skin. • Many people who get calciphylaxis also have kidney failure or receive dialysis. • It's not known why people with kidney failure or people receiving dialysis are at higher risk of calciphylaxis. • For some people, the calcium buildup in calciphylaxis is linked with small organs in the neck called parathyroid glands. • If the glands release too many parathyroid hormones, that can cause calcium to collect. • But the link isn't clear. • Most people with seriously overactive parathyroid glands don't get calciphylaxis. • And many people with kidney failure and calciphylaxis don't have overactive parathyroid glands. • Other factors that seem to play roles in calciphylaxis include: A greater tendency for blood to clot. • Blood clots can deprive fat tissues and skin of oxygen and nourishment. • Reduced blood flow in small arteries, which can lead to skin lumps and ulcers. • Thickening or scarring of tissue, also called fibrosis. • Ongoing damage to the thin layer of cells that lines blood vessels. • This also is called vascular endothelial injury. • Swelling, called inflammation, in the body.",
      "Risk factors": "Calciphylaxis most often affects people who have kidney failure. • Other risk factors include: Being born female. • Obesity. • Diabetes mellitus. • Liver failure, when the liver stops working as it should. • A history of dialysis. • This procedure removes waste and extra fluid from the blood when the kidneys no longer can. • A greater tendency for blood to clot, also called a hypercoagulable state. • An imbalance in the body of the minerals calcium or phosphate, or of the protein albumin. • Some medicines, such as warfarin (Jantoven), calcium-binding agents and corticosteroids.",
      "Complications": "Complications of calciphylaxis include: Serious pain. • Large, deep ulcers that do not heal on their own. • Blood infections. • Death, mainly due to infection or organ failure. • Often, the outlook for people with calciphylaxis isn't hopeful. • Finding and treating any infections early is key to preventing serious complications.",
      "Prevention": "There isn't a clear way to prevent calciphylaxis. • But if you are on dialysis or have low kidney function due to advanced chronic kidney disease, it's important to keep blood levels of calcium and phosphorus under control. • Keeping blood levels of phosphorus under control often is a challenge. • Your healthcare professional might have you take medicines with meals. • You also may need to restrict certain foods that are high in phosphorus. • It's very important to follow your healthcare professional's directions and go to all follow-up healthcare checkups. • If you have calciphylaxis, your healthcare team helps you prevent ulcer infections or other complications. • You may need to apply special wound dressings or clean the ulcers daily to prevent germs called bacteria from growing."

      "Overview": "Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. • Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body. • Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world. • But survival rates are improving for many types of cancer, thanks to improvements in cancer screening, treatment and prevention.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected. • Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include: Fatigue Lump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin Weight changes, including unintended loss or gain Skin changes, such as yellowing, darkening or redness of the skin, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles Changes in bowel or bladder habits Persistent cough or trouble breathing Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness Persistent indigestion or discomfort after eating Persistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain Persistent, unexplained fevers or night sweats Unexplained bleeding or bruising Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that concern you. • If you don't have any signs or symptoms, but are worried about your risk of cancer, discuss your concerns with your doctor. • Ask about which cancer screening tests and procedures are appropriate for you.",
      "Causes": "Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. • The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. • Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. • A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: Allow rapid growth. • A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. • This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. • Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. • Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. • Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing. • A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. • Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. • DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell's DNA and make corrections. • A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren't corrected, leading cells to become cancerous. • These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. • But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer. • Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations you're born with. • You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. • This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. • Gene mutations that occur after birth. • Most gene mutations occur after you're born and aren't inherited. • A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens), obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise. • Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. • However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. • Occasionally, a mistake is missed. • This could cause a cell to become cancerous. • The gene mutations you're born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. • For instance, if you've inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn't mean you're certain to get cancer. • Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. • Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance. • It's not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. • It's likely that this varies among cancer types.",
      "Risk factors": "While doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don't have any known risk factors. • Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include: Cancer can take decades to develop. • That's why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. • While it's more common in older adults, cancer isn't exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age. • Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. • Smoking, drinking more than one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer. • You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others. • Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. • If cancer is common in your family, it's possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. • You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. • Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn't necessarily mean you'll get cancer. • Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. • Talk to your doctor about your risk. • The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. • Even if you don't smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. • Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.",
      "Complications": "Cancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including: Pain. • Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. • Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain. • Fatigue. • Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. • Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it's usually temporary. • Difficulty breathing. • Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. • Treatments may bring relief. • Nausea. • Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. • Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. • Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea. • Diarrhea or constipation. • Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation. • Weight loss. • Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. • Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. • This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it's difficult to treat. • In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss. • Chemical changes in your body. • Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. • Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion. • Brain and nervous system problems. • Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. • Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body. • Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. • In some cases the body's immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. • Called paraneoplastic syndromes, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures. • Cancer that spreads. • As cancer advances, it may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. • Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer. • Cancer that returns. • Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. • Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. • Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. • Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. • This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.",
      "Prevention": "Doctors have identified several ways to reduce your risk of cancer, such as: Stop smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • If you don't smoke, don't start. • Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. • Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future. • Avoid excessive sun exposure. • Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. • Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen. • Eat a healthy diet. • Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. • Select whole grains and lean proteins. • Limit your intake of processed meats. • Exercise most days of the week. • Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. • If you haven't been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. • Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if you choose to drink. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Schedule cancer screening exams. • Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors. • Ask your doctor about immunizations. • Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer. • Immunizations may help prevent those viruses, including hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver cancer, and human papillomavirus (HPV), which increases the risk of cervical cancer and other cancers. • Ask your doctor whether immunization against these viruses is appropriate for you."

      "Overview": "Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. • Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. • They can be painful, however, and can make eating and talking difficult. • Most canker sores go away on their own in a week or two. • Check with your doctor or dentist if you have unusually large or painful canker sores or canker sores that don't seem to heal.",
      "Symptoms": "Most canker sores are round or oval with a white or yellow center and a red border. • They form inside your mouth — on or under your tongue, inside your cheeks or lips, at the base of your gums, or on your soft palate. • You might notice a tingling or burning sensation a day or two before the sores actually appear. • There are several types of canker sores, including minor, major and herpetiform sores. • Minor canker sores are the most common and: Are usually small Are oval shaped with a red edge Heal without scarring in one to two weeks Major canker sores are less common and: Are larger and deeper than minor canker sores Are usually round with defined borders, but may have irregular edges when very large Can be extremely painful May take up to six weeks to heal and can leave extensive scarring Herpetiform canker sores are uncommon and usually develop later in life, but they're not caused by herpes virus infection. • These canker sores: Are pinpoint size Often occur in clusters of 10 to 100 sores, but may merge into one large ulcer Have irregular edges Heal without scarring in one to two weeks Consult your doctor if you experience: Unusually large canker sores Recurring sores, with new ones developing before old ones heal, or frequent outbreaks Persistent sores, lasting two weeks or more Sores that extend into the lips themselves (vermilion border) Pain that you can't control with self-care measures Extreme difficulty eating or drinking High fever along with canker sores See your dentist if you have sharp tooth surfaces or dental appliances that seem to trigger the sores. • The precise cause of canker sores remains unclear, though researchers suspect that a combination of factors contributes to outbreaks, even in the same person. • Possible triggers for canker sores include: A minor injury to your mouth from dental work, overzealous brushing, sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bite Toothpastes and mouth rinses containing sodium lauryl sulfate Food sensitivities, particularly to chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, cheese, and spicy or acidic foods A diet lacking in vitamin B-12, zinc, folate (folic acid) or iron An allergic response to certain bacteria in your mouth Helicobacter pylori, the same bacteria that cause peptic ulcers Hormonal shifts during menstruation Emotional stress Canker sores may also occur because of certain conditions and diseases, such as: Celiac disease, a serious intestinal disorder caused by a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in most grains Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Behcet's disease, a rare disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body, including the mouth A faulty immune system that attacks healthy cells in your mouth instead of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria HIV/AIDS, which suppresses the immune system Unlike cold sores, canker sores are not associated with herpes virus infections. • Anyone can develop canker sores. • But they occur more often in teens and young adults, and they're more common in females. • Often people with recurrent canker sores have a family history of the disorder. • This may be due to heredity or to a shared factor in the environment, such as certain foods or allergens. • Canker sores often recur, but you may be able to reduce their frequency by following these tips: Watch what you eat. • Try to avoid foods that seem to irritate your mouth. • These may include nuts, chips, pretzels, certain spices, salty foods and acidic fruits, such as pineapple, grapefruit and oranges. • Avoid any foods to which you're sensitive or allergic. • Choose healthy foods. • To help prevent nutritional deficiencies, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Follow good oral hygiene habits. • Regular brushing after meals and flossing once a day can keep your mouth clean and free of foods that might trigger a sore. • Use a soft brush to help prevent irritation to delicate mouth tissues, and avoid toothpastes and mouth rinses that contain sodium lauryl sulfate. • Protect your mouth. • If you have braces or other dental appliances, ask your dentist about orthodontic waxes to cover sharp edges. • Reduce your stress. • If your canker sores seem to be related to stress, learn and use stress-reduction techniques, such as meditation and guided imagery.",

      "Overview": "Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide builds up in the blood. • When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, the body replaces the oxygen in the red blood cells with carbon monoxide. • This can lead to serious tissue damage, or even death. • Carbon monoxide is gas that has no odor, taste or color. • Burning fuels, including gas, wood, propane or charcoal, make carbon monoxide. • Appliances and engines that aren't well vented can cause the gas to build up to dangerous levels. • A tightly enclosed space makes the buildup worse. • Anyone exposed to carbon monoxide needs to get into fresh air and seek medical care right away. • Call emergency medical services (EMS) or dial 911 right away for someone who's in a coma or can't respond.",
      "Symptoms": "Carbon monoxide poisoning affects the brain and heart the most. • Exposure over time might lead to symptoms that can be mistaken for the flu without the fever. • Clearer symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can include: Headache. • Weakness. • Dizziness. • Nausea or vomiting. • Shortness of breath. • Confusion. • Blurred vision. • Drowsiness. • Loss of muscle control. • Loss of consciousness. • Symptoms related to the nervous system and brain can come on after recovery from carbon monoxide poisoning. • The risk of these is higher in people who lost consciousness from the carbon monoxide and older people. • Symptoms might include: Memory loss. • Personality changes. • Movement problems. • Carbon monoxide poisoning can be especially dangerous for people who are asleep, drugged or drunk. • Carbon monoxide can cause brain damage or death before anyone realizes there's a problem. • For possible carbon monoxide poisoning, get into fresh air and seek medical care right away. • Many fuel-burning products and engines make carbon monoxide. • Most often the amount of carbon monoxide from these sources isn't cause for worry in areas with good air flow. • But if they're used in a partly closed or closed space, the carbon monoxide level can be a danger. • Examples are using a charcoal grill indoors or a running car inside a garage. • Breathing the fumes causes carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. • This prevents oxygen from getting to tissues and organs. • Breathing in smoke during a fire also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. • And smoking through a water pipe, called a hookah, has been linked to increasing numbers of younger people getting carbon monoxide poisoning. • Breathing in carbon monoxide can be especially dangerous for: Unborn babies. • Fetal blood cells take up carbon monoxide more easily than adult blood cells do. • Infants and children. • Young children take breaths more often than adults do. • Older adults. • Older people who have carbon monoxide poisoning may be more likely to get brain damage. • Damage from carbon monoxide depends on how much is breathed in and for how long. • Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause: Brain damage that doesn't heal. • Damage to the heart, possibly leading to life-threatening heart problems. • Death. • To help prevent carbon monoxide poisoning: Have carbon monoxide detectors in the home. • Put them near each sleeping area on every level of the house. • Check the batteries at least twice a year at the same time as checking the smoke detector batteries. • If the alarm sounds, believe it! Leave the house and call 911 or the fire department. • Carbon monoxide detectors are also made for motor homes and boats. • Open the garage door before starting the car. • Never leave a car running in the garage, especially if the garage is attached to the house. • That's true even if the garage door is open. • Use gas appliances only as intended. • Never use a gas stove or oven for heat. • Use gas camp stoves outdoors only. • Use fuel-burning space heaters only when someone is awake to keep an eye on them and doors or windows are open. • Don't run a generator in an enclosed space, such as the basement or garage. • Make sure there's space around fuel-burning appliances and engines. • These include all gas appliances, space heaters and wood-burning stoves. • Make sure they're vented properly. • Have professionals set up all gas, oil or coal-burning appliances. • Have a qualified service-provider service them yearly. • Keep fireplaces in good condition. • Clean the fireplace chimney and flue every year. • Keep vents and chimneys unblocked during remodeling. • Check that they aren't covered by tarps or debris. • Do repairs before returning to where the poisoning occurred. • If carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred in the home, find and repair the source of the carbon monoxide before staying there again. • Have a qualified service person check and repair any appliances that might have caused the leak.",

      "Overview": "Carcinoid tumors are a type of slow-growing cancer that can arise in several places throughout your body. • Carcinoid tumors, which are one subset of tumors called neuroendocrine tumors, usually begin in the digestive tract (stomach, appendix, small intestine, colon, rectum) or in the lungs. • Carcinoid tumors often don't cause signs and symptoms until late in the disease. • Carcinoid tumors can produce and release hormones into your body that cause signs and symptoms such as diarrhea or skin flushing. • Treatment for carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery and may include medications.",
      "Symptoms": "Some carcinoid tumors don't cause any signs or symptoms. • When they do occur, signs and symptoms are usually vague and depend on the location of the tumor. • Signs and symptoms of carcinoid lung tumors include: Chest pain Wheezing Shortness of breath Diarrhea Redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing) Weight gain, particularly around the midsection and upper back Pink or purple marks on the skin that look like stretch marks Signs and symptoms of carcinoid tumors in the digestive tract include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea Nausea, vomiting and inability to pass stool due to intestinal blockage (bowel obstruction) Rectal bleeding Rectal pain Redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing) If you experience any signs and symptoms that bother you and are persistent, make an appointment with your doctor. • It's not clear what causes carcinoid tumors. • In general, cancer occurs when a cell develops mutations in its DNA. • The mutations allow the cell to continue growing and dividing when healthy cells would normally die. • The accumulating cells form a tumor. • Cancer cells can invade nearby healthy tissue and spread to other parts of the body. • Doctors don't know what causes the mutations that can lead to carcinoid tumors. • But they know that carcinoid tumors develop in neuroendocrine cells. • Neuroendocrine cells are found in various organs throughout the body. • They perform some nerve cell functions and some hormone-producing endocrine cell functions. • Some hormones that are produced by neuroendocrine cells are histamine, insulin and serotonin. • Factors that increase the risk of carcinoid tumors include: Older age. • Older adults are more likely to be diagnosed with a carcinoid tumor than are younger people or children. • Sex. • Women are more likely than men to develop carcinoid tumors. • Family history. • A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), increases the risk of carcinoid tumors. • In people with MEN 1 multiple tumors occur in glands of the endocrine system. • The cells of carcinoid tumors can secrete hormones and other chemicals, causing a range of complications including: Carcinoid syndrome. • Carcinoid syndrome causes redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing), chronic diarrhea, and difficulty breathing, among other signs and symptoms. • Carcinoid heart disease. • Carcinoid tumors may secrete hormones that can cause thickening of the lining of heart chambers, valves and blood vessels. • This can lead to leaky heart valves and heart failure that may require valve-replacement surgery. • Carcinoid heart disease can usually be controlled with medications. • Cushing syndrome. • A lung carcinoid tumor can produce an excess of a hormone that can cause your body to produce too much of the hormone cortisol.",

      "Overview": "Carcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis healthcare professionals give when they can't find where a cancer started. • A carcinoma of unknown primary is an advanced cancer that has spread in the body. • Most often, health professionals detect a cancer when it grows in the place where it started. • The place where a cancer started growing is called the primary cancer. • Sometimes health professionals first detect a cancer when it spreads. • When cancer spreads it's called metastatic cancer. • In carcinoma of unknown primary, healthcare professionals find the metastatic cancer. • But they can't find the primary cancer. • Carcinoma of unknown primary also is called occult primary cancer. • Healthcare teams often use the kind of primary cancer you have to help decide on the treatment. • If you're found to have carcinoma of unknown primary, this piece of information is missing. • Your healthcare team will work to find out what kind of cancer you have.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of carcinoma of unknown primary include: A cough that won't go away. • Feeling very tired. • Fever that doesn't have a clear cause. • Losing weight without trying. • Nausea and vomiting. • Pain in one part of the body. • Swelling of the belly. • Swollen lymph nodes. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "The cause of carcinoma of unknown primary often isn't known. • Healthcare professionals use this diagnosis when they find signs of cancer that has spread but can't find where the cancer started. • The place where a cancer started growing is called the primary cancer. • Carcinoma of unknown primary can happen if: The primary cancer is too small to detect with imaging tests. • The primary cancer was killed by the body's immune system. • The primary cancer was removed in an operation for another condition.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of carcinoma of unknown primary might be related to: Older age. • This type of cancer happens most often in people older than 60. • Family history of cancer. • If a close relative had carcinoma of unknown primary, you may have an increased risk of this cancer. • There also is some evidence that carcinoma of unknown primary happens more often in people with a family history of cancer that affects the lungs, kidneys or colon. • Smoking cigarettes. • People who smoke cigarettes may have a higher risk of carcinoma of unknown primary."

      "Overview": "Cardiomyopathy (kahr-dee-o-my-OP-uh-thee) is a disease of the heart muscle. • It causes the heart to have a harder time pumping blood to the rest of the body, which can lead to symptoms of heart failure. • Cardiomyopathy also can lead to some other serious heart conditions. • There are various types of cardiomyopathy. • The main types include dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. • Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgically implanted devices and heart surgery. • Some people with severe cardiomyopathy need a heart transplant. • Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people with cardiomyopathy don't ever get symptoms. • For others, symptoms appear as the condition becomes worse. • Cardiomyopathy symptoms can include: Shortness of breath or trouble breathing with activity or even at rest. • Chest pain, especially after physical activity or heavy meals. • Heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering. • Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, stomach area and neck veins. • Bloating of the stomach area due to fluid buildup. • Cough while lying down. • Trouble lying flat to sleep. • Fatigue, even after getting rest. • Dizziness. • Fainting. • Symptoms tend to get worse unless they are treated. • In some people, the condition becomes worse quickly. • In others, it might not become worse for a long time. • See your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of cardiomyopathy. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you faint, have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes. • Some types of cardiomyopathy can be passed down through families. • If you have the condition, your healthcare professional might recommend that your family members be checked. • Often, the cause of the cardiomyopathy isn't known. • But some people get it due to another condition. • This is known as acquired cardiomyopathy. • Other people are born with cardiomyopathy because of a gene passed on from a parent. • This is called inherited cardiomyopathy. • Certain health conditions or behaviors that can lead to acquired cardiomyopathy include: Long-term high blood pressure. • Heart tissue damage from a heart attack. • Long-term rapid heart rate. • Heart valve problems. • COVID-19 infection. • Certain infections, especially those that cause inflammation of the heart. • Metabolic disorders, such as obesity, thyroid disease or diabetes. • Lack of essential vitamins or minerals in the diet, such as thiamin (vitamin B-1). • Pregnancy complications. • Iron buildup in the heart muscle, called hemochromatosis. • The growth of tiny lumps of inflammatory cells called granulomas in any part of the body. • When this happens in the heart or lungs, it's called sarcoidosis. • The buildup of irregular proteins in the organs, called amyloidosis. • Connective tissue disorders. • Drinking too much alcohol over many years. • Use of cocaine, amphetamines or anabolic steroids. • Use of some chemotherapy medicines and radiation to treat cancer. • Types of cardiomyopathy include: Dilated cardiomyopathy. • In this type of cardiomyopathy, the heart's chambers thin and stretch, growing larger. • The condition tends to start in the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle. • As a result, the heart has trouble pumping blood to the rest of the body. • This type can affect people of all ages. • But it happens most often in people younger than 50 and is more likely to affect men. • Conditions that can lead to a dilated heart include coronary artery disease and heart attack. • But for some people, gene changes play a role in the disease. • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • In this type, the heart muscle becomes thickened. • This makes it harder for the heart to work. • The condition mostly affects the muscle of the heart's main pumping chamber. • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can start at any age. • But it tends to be worse if it happens during childhood. • Most people with this type of cardiomyopathy have a family history of the disease. • Some gene changes have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • The condition doesn't happen due to a heart problem. • Restrictive cardiomyopathy. • In this type, the heart muscle becomes stiff and less flexible. • As a result, it can't expand and fill with blood between heartbeats. • This least common type of cardiomyopathy can happen at any age. • But it most often affects older people. • Restrictive cardiomyopathy can occur for no known reason, also called an idiopathic cause. • Or it can by caused by a disease elsewhere in the body that affects the heart, such as amyloidosis. • Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). • This is a rare type of cardiomyopathy that tends to happen between the ages of 10 and 50. • It mainly affects the muscle in the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle. • The muscle is replaced by fat that can become scarred. • This can lead to heart rhythm problems. • Sometimes, the condition involves the left ventricle as well. • ARVC often is caused by gene changes. • Unclassified cardiomyopathy. • Other types of cardiomyopathy fall into this group. • Many things can raise the risk of cardiomyopathy, including: Family history of cardiomyopathy, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. • Long-term high blood pressure. • Conditions that affect the heart. • These include a past heart attack, coronary artery disease or an infection in the heart. • Obesity, which makes the heart work harder. • Long-term alcohol misuse. • Illicit drug use, such as cocaine, amphetamines and anabolic steroids. • Treatment with certain chemotherapy medicines and radiation for cancer. • Many diseases also raise the risk of cardiomyopathy, including: Diabetes. • Thyroid disease. • Storage of excess iron in the body, called hemochromatosis. • Buildup of a certain protein in organs, called amyloidosis. • The growth of small patches of inflamed tissue in organs, called sarcoidosis. • Connective tissue disorders. • Cardiomyopathy can lead to serious medical conditions, including: Heart failure. • The heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Without treatment, heart failure can be life-threatening. • Blood clots. • Because the heart can't pump well, blood clots might form in the heart. • If clots enter the bloodstream, they can block the blood flow to other organs, including the heart and brain. • Heart valve problems. • Because cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become larger, the heart valves might not close properly. • This can cause blood to flow backward in the valve. • Cardiac arrest and sudden death. • Cardiomyopathy can trigger irregular heart rhythms that cause fainting. • Sometimes, irregular heartbeats can cause sudden death if the heart stops beating effectively. • Inherited types of cardiomyopathy can't be prevented. • Let your healthcare professional know if you have a family history of the condition. • You can help lower the risk of acquired types of cardiomyopathy, which are caused by other conditions. • Take steps to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle, including: Stay away from alcohol or illegal drugs such as cocaine. • Control any other conditions you have, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. • Eat a healthy diet. • Get regular exercise. • Get enough sleep. • Lower your stress. • These healthy habits also can help people with inherited cardiomyopathy control their symptoms.",

      "Overview": "Carotid artery disease occurs when fatty deposits, called plaques, clog the blood vessels that deliver blood to the brain and head (carotid arteries). • The clog increases the risk of stroke. • Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the brain loses all or much of its blood supply. • During a stroke, the brain doesn't get oxygen and brain cells begin to die within minutes. • Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. • Carotid artery disease often develops slowly. • The first sign of the condition might be a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). • A TIA is a temporary shortage of blood flow to the brain. • Treatment of carotid artery disease usually involves lifestyle changes, medicines and sometimes surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "In its early stages, carotid artery disease often doesn't have symptoms. • The condition might not be obvious until it's serious enough to deprive the brain of blood, causing a stroke or TIA. • Symptoms of a stroke or TIA include: Sudden numbness or weakness in the face or limbs, often on one side of the body. • Sudden trouble speaking and understanding speech. • Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes. • Sudden dizziness or loss of balance. • Sudden, severe headache with no known cause. • Seek emergency care for any symptoms of a stroke. • Even if they last only a short while and then you feel OK, see a health care provider right away. • You might have had a TIA. • A TIA puts you at risk of a stroke. • Talk to your health care provider if you have risk factors for carotid artery disease even if you don't have symptoms. • Managing the risk factors might protect you from a stroke. • Seeing a provider early increases your chances of finding carotid artery disease and getting treatment before a stroke occurs. • A buildup of fatty deposits, known as plaques, in the arteries that send blood to the brain cause carotid artery disease. • Plaques are clumps that include cholesterol, fat and blood cells that form in the artery. • This process is called atherosclerosis. • Carotid arteries that are clogged with plaques narrow. • A clog in carotid arteries makes it hard for oxygen and nutrients to reach the brain. • Factors that increase the risk of carotid artery disease include: High blood pressure. • Too much pressure on artery walls can weaken them and make them easier to damage. • Tobacco use. • Nicotine can irritate the inner lining of the arteries. • Smoking also increases heart rate and blood pressure. • Diabetes. • Diabetes lowers the ability to process fats, creating a greater risk of high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. • High blood-fat levels. • High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, a blood fat, help the buildup of plaques. • Family history. • The risk of carotid artery disease is higher if a relative has atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. • Age. • Arteries become less flexible and more likely to be injured with age. • Obesity. • Excess weight increases the chances of high blood pressure, atherosclerosis and diabetes. • Sleep apnea. • Spells of stopping breathing at night might increase the risk of stroke. • Lack of exercise. • Not exercising leads to conditions that can damage the arteries, including high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. • Carotid artery disease causes about 10% to 15% of strokes. • A stroke is a medical emergency that can cause brain damage, muscle weakness and possibly death. • Carotid artery disease can lead to stroke through: Reduced blood flow. • A carotid artery might get so narrow because of atherosclerosis that not enough blood reaches parts of the brain. • Ruptured plaques. • A piece of a plaque can break off and travel to smaller arteries in the brain. • The piece of plaque can get stuck in one of these smaller arteries. • This blockage cuts off blood supply to part of the brain. • Blood clot blockage. • Some plaques are prone to cracking and forming irregular surfaces on the artery wall. • The body reacts as it does to an injury. • It sends blood cells that help the clotting process to the area. • The result can be a large clot that blocks or slows blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. • These steps can help prevent carotid artery disease or keep it from getting worse: Don't smoke. • Within a few years of quitting, a former smoker's risk of stroke is like a nonsmoker's. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight increases other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and sleep apnea. • Eat a healthy diet. • Focus on fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fish, nuts and legumes. • Limit cholesterol and fat, especially saturated and trans fats. • Limit salt. • Too much salt can increase blood pressure in some people. • Experts recommend that healthy adults eat less than 1,500 milligrams of salt a day. • Exercise regularly. • Exercise can lower blood pressure, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol — and improve the overall health of your blood vessels and heart. • It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress. • Limit or avoid alcohol. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Control illnesses. • Managing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure helps protect arteries.",

      "Complications": "Carotid artery disease causes about 10% to 15% of strokes. • A stroke is a medical emergency that can cause brain damage, muscle weakness and possibly death. • Carotid artery disease can lead to stroke through: Reduced blood flow. • A carotid artery might get so narrow because of atherosclerosis that not enough blood reaches parts of the brain. • Ruptured plaques. • A piece of a plaque can break off and travel to smaller arteries in the brain. • The piece of plaque can get stuck in one of these smaller arteries. • This blockage cuts off blood supply to part of the brain. • Blood clot blockage. • Some plaques are prone to cracking and forming irregular surfaces on the artery wall. • The body reacts as it does to an injury. • It sends blood cells that help the clotting process to the area. • The result can be a large clot that blocks or slows blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.",
      "Prevention": "These steps can help prevent carotid artery disease or keep it from getting worse: Don't smoke. • Within a few years of quitting, a former smoker's risk of stroke is like a nonsmoker's. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight increases other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and sleep apnea. • Eat a healthy diet. • Focus on fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fish, nuts and legumes. • Limit cholesterol and fat, especially saturated and trans fats. • Limit salt. • Too much salt can increase blood pressure in some people. • Experts recommend that healthy adults eat less than 1,500 milligrams of salt a day. • Exercise regularly. • Exercise can lower blood pressure, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol — and improve the overall health of your blood vessels and heart. • It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress. • Limit or avoid alcohol. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Control illnesses. • Managing conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure helps protect arteries."

      "Overview": "Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common hand conditions. • It is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist. • The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of the hand. • When the median nerve is compressed, symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the thumb and fingers. • Wrist anatomy, health conditions and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome. • Proper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores hand function.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include: Tingling and numbness. • Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. • Usually the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. • You might have a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. • These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep. • The sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm. • Many people \"shake out\" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. • The numb feeling may become constant over time. • Weakness. • People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects. • This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve. • See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that interfere with your usual activities and sleep patterns. • Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur without treatment. • Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. • The median nerve runs from the forearm through a passageway in the wrist to the hand, known as the carpal tunnel. • The median nerve provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and all of the fingers except the little finger. • This nerve also provides signals to move the muscles around the base of the thumb. • This movement is known as motor function. • Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. • A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve. • This also may occur due to swelling and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis or other diseases. • Many times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. • Or the cause may not be known. • It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the condition. • Several factors have been linked with carpal tunnel syndrome. • Although they may not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median nerve. • These include: Anatomical factors. • A wrist fracture or dislocation can alter the space within the carpal tunnel. • Arthritis that causes changes to the small bones in the wrist can affect the carpal tunnel. • These changes can put pressure on the median nerve. • People who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome. • Sex assigned at birth. • Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. • This may be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men. • Or it may be due to the effect of hormones on the lining of the tendons in the carpal tunnel. • Women who have carpal tunnel syndrome also may have smaller carpal tunnels than do women who don't have the condition. • Nerve-damaging conditions. • Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk of nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve. • Inflammatory conditions. • Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and other conditions that cause swelling, known as inflammation, can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist. • This can put pressure on the median nerve. • Medicines. • Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and anastrozole (Arimidex), a medicine used to treat breast cancer. • Obesity. • Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome. • Body fluid changes. • Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. • This is common during pregnancy and menopause. • Carpal tunnel syndrome that happens with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy. • Other medical conditions. • Certain conditions, such as thyroid disorders, kidney failure and lymphedema, may increase the chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome. • Workplace factors. • Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires repeated movements that flex the wrist may create pressure on the median nerve. • Such work also may worsen existing nerve damage. • Pressure on the nerve can be worse if the work is done in a cold environment. • However, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. • Several studies have evaluated whether there is a link between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome. • Some evidence suggests that mouse use, but not the use of a keyboard, may be related to carpal tunnel syndrome. • There has not been enough quality and consistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome. • However, computer use may cause a different form of hand pain. • There are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can lessen stress on the hands and wrists with these methods: Reduce your force and relax your grip. • If your work involves a cash register or keyboard, for instance, hit the keys softly. • Take short, frequent breaks. • Gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists periodically. • Alternate tasks when possible. • This is especially important if you use equipment that vibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force. • Taking a break for even a few minutes each hour can make a difference. • Watch your form. • Do not bend your wrist all the way up or down when using a keyboard. • A relaxed middle position with the wrists parallel to the floor is best. • Keep your keyboard at elbow height or slightly lower. • Improve your posture. • The wrong posture can occur when you adjust your body to view a computer screen rather than adjusting the screen height and distance to a correct posture. • The wrong posture rolls shoulders forward, shortens the neck and shoulder muscles, and compresses nerves in the neck. • This can cause neck pain and also may bother the hands and arms. • Change your computer mouse. • Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable to use and doesn't strain your wrist. • Keep your hands warm. • You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in a cold environment. • If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that keep the hands and wrists warm.",

      "Overview": "Castleman disease is a group of rare disorders that involves lymph nodes that get bigger, called enlarged lymph nodes, and a wide range of symptoms. • The most common form of the disorder involves a single enlarged lymph node. • This lymph node is usually in the chest or neck, but it can occur in other areas of the body as well. • This form of the disorder is called unicentric Castleman disease (UCD). • Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes, inflammatory symptoms and problems with organ function. • There are three types of MCD: HHV-8-associated MCD. • This type is linked to human herpes virus type 8, called HHV-8, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). • Idiopathic MCD. • The cause of this type is unknown. • This also is called HHV-8-negative MCD. • The most serious form of this type of MCD is known as iMCD-TAFRO. • This condition gets its name from the symptoms it causes. • POEMS-associated MCD. • This type is linked to another condition called POEMS syndrome. • POEMS syndrome is a rare blood disorder that damages nerves and affects other parts of the body. • Sometimes, people may have 2-3 enlarged lymph nodes and mild symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for MCD. • These people may have another disease, or they may have the recently described subtype of Castleman disease called oligocentric Castleman disease. • This subtype is rare. • Treatment and outlook vary depending on the type of Castleman disease you have. • Unicentric Castleman disease, which is the type that involves only one enlarged lymph node, can usually be successfully treated with surgery. • The best treatment for oligocentric Castleman disease, which involves a few enlarged lymph nodes and has limited symptoms, is not known but is thought to be similar to the treatment for unicentric Castleman disease. • While not all people with MCD respond to the first treatment, there are medicines that work to treat HHV-8-associated MCD and idiopathic MCD.",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with unicentric Castleman disease don't notice any signs or symptoms. • The enlarged lymph node may be found during a physical exam or an imaging test for a different problem. • Some people with unicentric Castleman disease might have signs and symptoms that are more often seen in multicentric Castleman disease. • These may include: Fever. • Weight loss that happens without trying. • Fatigue. • Night sweats. • Swelling. • Enlarged liver or spleen. • Low red blood cell count, also called anemia. • High or low platelet counts. • Higher creatinine levels that happen because the kidneys don't work properly. • Higher levels of antibodies known as immunoglobulins. • Low levels of a blood protein called albumin. • Symptoms of the more serious form of idiopathic MCD called iMCD-TAFRO are: Low platelet count, also called thrombocytopenia. • Swelling and fluid in the body, known as anasarca. • Fever or a higher level of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. • Reticulin fibrosis, which is checked by taking a sample of bone marrow. • Organ swelling, also called organomegaly. • If you notice an enlarged lymph node on the side of your neck or in your underarm, collarbone or groin area, talk with your healthcare professional. • Also call your care team if you have a lasting feeling of fullness in your chest or abdomen, fever, fatigue, or weight loss that you can't explain.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes unicentric Castleman disease or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). • However, HHV-8-positive MCD is known to occur in people who don't have typical function in their immune systems because of HIV or other causes.",
      "Risk factors": "Castleman disease can affect people of any age or gender. • People usually are diagnosed with Castleman disease during midlife, but it can happen at any age, including during childhood. • There are no known risk factors for unicentric Castleman disease or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. • Infection with HIV or having a condition that decreases how well the immune system works raises the risk of having HHV-8-positive multicentric Castleman disease.",
      "Complications": "People with unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) usually do well once the affected lymph node is removed, and life expectancy is usually not changed. • But they are at increased risk of developing a rare autoimmune condition called paraneoplastic pemphigus. • This condition can be life-threatening. • Paraneoplastic pemphigus causes blisters in the mouth and on the skin that are often misdiagnosed. • Though the risk of developing paraneoplastic pemphigus is low, being checked for this condition is important if you have UCD. • Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease can rapidly get worse to involve life-threatening problems with organ function. • This requires critical care with a machine that helps with breathing, called a ventilator, and treatments that help with organs function, such as dialysis and transfusions. • HHV-8-positive multicentric Castleman disease may involve life-threatening infections and organ failure. • People who also have HIV/AIDS generally have worse outcomes."

      "Overview": "A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye, which is typically clear. • For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. • Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car at night or see the expression on a friend's face. • Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb eyesight early on. • But with time, cataracts will eventually affect vision. • At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts. • But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed. • Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of cataracts include: Clouded, blurred or dim vision. • Trouble seeing at night. • Sensitivity to light and glare. • Need for brighter light for reading and other activities. • Seeing \"halos\" around lights. • Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription. • Fading or yellowing of colors. • Double vision in one eye. • At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens. • You may not notice any vision loss. • As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens. • More clouding changes the light passing through the lens. • This may lead to symptoms you notice more. • Make an appointment for an eye exam if you notice any changes in your vision. • If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or a sudden headache, see a member of your health care team right away. • Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up the eye's lens. • Proteins and fibers in the lens begin to break down. • This causes vision to become hazy or cloudy. • Some disorders passed down from parents that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. • Cataracts also can be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. • Long-term use of steroid medicines also may cause cataracts to develop. • A cataract is a cloudy lens. • The lens sits behind the colored part of your eye, called the iris. • The lens focuses light that passes into your eye. • This produces clear, sharp images on the back part of the eye, called the retina. • As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less clear and thicker. • Aging and some medical conditions can cause proteins and fibers within the lenses to break down and clump together. • This is what causes the clouding in the lenses. • As the cataract grows, the clouding becomes worse. • A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens. • This prevents a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. • As a result, your vision becomes blurred. • Cataracts usually happen in both eyes, but not always at the same rate. • The cataract in one eye may be worse than the other. • This causes a difference in vision between eyes. • Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens, called nuclear cataracts. • A nuclear cataract may at first cause objects far away to be blurry but objects up close to look clear. • A nuclear cataract may even improve your reading vision for a short time. • But with time, the lens slowly turns more yellow or brown and makes your vision worse. • It may become difficult to tell colors apart. • Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens, called cortical cataracts. • A cortical cataract begins as white, wedge-shaped spots or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. • As the cataract slowly grows, the streaks spread to the center and affect light passing through the lens. • Cataracts that affect the back of the lens, called posterior subcapsular cataracts. • A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small spot that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. • A posterior subcapsular cataract often affects your reading vision. • It also may reduce your vision in bright light and cause glare or halos around lights at night. • These types of cataracts tend to grow faster than others. • Cataracts you're born with, called congenital cataracts. • Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. • These cataracts may be passed down from parents. • They also may be associated with an infection or trauma while in the womb. • These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions. • These may include myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. • Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision. • If they do, they're usually removed soon after they're found. • Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age. • Diabetes. • Getting too much sunlight. • Smoking. • Obesity. • Family history of cataracts. • Previous eye injury or inflammation. • Previous eye surgery. • Prolonged use of corticosteroid medicines. • Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. • No studies have proved how to prevent or slow the growth of cataracts. • But health care professionals think several strategies may be helpful, including: Regular eye exams. • Eye exams can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. • Ask your health care team how often you should have an eye examination. • Do not smoke. • Ask a member of your health care team how to stop smoking. • Medicines, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. • Manage other health problems. • Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts. • Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. • Adding fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. • Fruits and vegetables have antioxidants. • Antioxidants help maintain the health of your eyes. • Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. • But a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals reduced the risk of developing cataracts. • Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits. • Eating them is a safe way to get enough minerals and vitamins in your diet. • Wear sunglasses. • Ultraviolet light from the sun may cause cataracts. • Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you're outdoors. • Reduce

      "Overview": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are groups of tightly packed, irregular small blood vessels with thin walls. • They may be present in the brain or spinal cord. • The vessels contain slow-moving blood that's usually clotted. • CCMs look like small mulberries. • In some people, CCMs can cause blood to leak in the brain or spinal cord. • CCMs vary in size. • Often they are less than half an inch (1 centimeter). • Most CCMs are sporadic. • This means the CCM occurs as a single cavernous malformation and there isn't a family history. • But about 20% of CCMs affect people of the same family. • These are known as familial CCMs. • Familial CCMs are related to a gene change passed down through families. • People with familial CCMs usually have multiple cavernous malformations. • A CCM is one of several types of brain vascular malformations that contain irregular blood vessels. • Other types of vascular malformations include: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM). • Dural arteriovenous fistula. • Developmental venous anomaly (DVA). • Capillary telangiectasia. • For people who have the sporadic form, it's common to have both a DVA and a CCM. • CCMs may leak blood and lead to bleeding in the brain or spinal cord, known as a hemorrhage. • Brain hemorrhages can cause many symptoms, such as seizures. • Depending on the location, CCMs also can cause stroke-like symptoms such as trouble with movement or feeling in the legs and sometimes the arms. • CCMs also may cause bowel and bladder symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) may not cause symptoms. • Sometimes when the CCM occurs on the outer surface of the brain, it can cause seizures. • And CCMs found in other areas can have a variety of symptoms. • These include CCMs in the spinal cord, the brainstem linking the spinal cord and brain, and the basal ganglia in the inner brain. • For example, bleeding in the spinal cord may cause bowel and bladder symptoms or trouble with movement or feeling in the legs or arms. • Generally, symptoms of CCMs may include: Seizures. • Bad headaches. • Weakness in the arms or legs. • Numbness. • Trouble speaking. • Poor memory and attention. • Trouble balancing and walking. • Vision changes, such as double vision. • Symptoms can get worse over time with repeated bleeding. • Bleeding can happen again soon after the first bleed or much later. • In some people, a repeat bleed may never occur. • Seek medical help right away if you experience any symptoms of a seizure. • Also get immediate medical help if you have symptoms that suggest a cerebral cavernous malformation or brain bleeding.",
      "Causes": "Most cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are known as the \"sporadic form.\" They occur as a single malformation without any family history. • The sporadic form often has an associated developmental venous anomaly (DVA), which is an irregular vein with a witch's broom appearance. • However, about 20% of people with a CCM have a genetic form. • This form is passed down in families, known as familial cavernous malformation syndrome. • People with this form may have family members with CCMs, most often with more than one malformation. • A diagnosis can be confirmed by a genetic test that requires a blood or saliva sample. • Genetic testing is often recommended for people who have: MRI evidence of multiple CCMs without a DVA. • A family history of CCMs. • Radiation to the brain or spinal cord also may result in CCMs within 2 to 20 years afterward. • Other rare syndromes may be associated with CCM.",
      "Risk factors": "Most cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) have no clear cause. • But the form that's passed down through families can cause multiple CCMs, both to start with and over time. • To date, research has identified three genetic changes responsible for cavernous malformations passed down through families. • Almost all familial cases of cavernous malformations have been traced through those genetic changes. • Familial CCMs are passed down in families through a change in one of these genes: KRIT1, also called CCM1. • CCM2. • PDCD10, also called CCM3. • These genes are responsible for affecting the leakiness of blood vessels and the proteins that keep the blood vessel cells together.",
      "Complications": "The most serious complications of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) stem from repeated bleeding, known as hemorrhages. • CCMs that bleed over and over again may cause a hemorrhagic stroke and lead to damage in the nervous system. • Bleeding is more likely to return in people with prior hemorrhages. • Bleeding also is more likely to happen again with CCMs located in the brainstem."

      "Overview": "Cavities are areas in the hard surface of your teeth that are damaged. • These areas of tooth decay become tiny openings or holes that can lead to a serious toothache, infection and tooth loss. • There are several causes of cavities, including bacteria in your mouth, snacking a lot, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning your teeth well. • Cavities and tooth decay are among the world's most common health problems. • They're especially common in children, teenagers and older adults. • But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including babies. • If cavities aren't treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth. • Regular dental visits and good brushing and flossing habits are the best ways to protect your teeth from cavities.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they're located. • When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms. • As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as: Toothache and other pain. • Tooth sensitivity. • Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold. • Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see. • Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth. • Pain when you bite down. • You may not be aware that a cavity is forming. • That's why it's important to have regular dental checkups and cleanings, even when your mouth feels fine. • But if you have a toothache or mouth pain, see your dentist as soon as possible. • Tooth decay causes cavities. • This is a process that occurs over time. • Here's how tooth decay happens: Plaque forms. • Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth. • It's due to eating a lot of sugars and starches and not cleaning your teeth well. • When you don't clean sugars and starches off your teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and forming plaque. • Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gumline into tartar. • Tartar makes plaque harder to remove and creates a shield for bacteria. • A dental professional needs to remove this plaque. • Plaque attacks. • The acids from bacteria remove minerals in your tooth's hard, outer enamel. • This erosion causes tiny openings or holes in the enamel — the first stage of cavities. • Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of your teeth, called dentin. • This layer is softer than enamel and less resistant to acid, causing your teeth to be more sensitive. • Damage continues. • As tooth decay happens, the bacteria and acid move through your teeth to the inner tooth material (pulp) that contains nerves and blood vessels. • The pulp becomes swollen and irritated from the bacteria. • Because there is no place for the swelling to expand inside of a tooth, the nerve becomes pressed, causing pain. • Sometimes pain and damage can spread outside of the tooth root to the bone, causing bone loss around the tooth and even reaching nearby teeth. • Anyone who has teeth can get cavities, but these factors raise the risk: Tooth location. • Decay most often occurs in your back teeth — your molars and premolars. • These teeth have lots of grooves, pits and crannies, and multiple roots that can collect food particles. • That's why they're harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy-to-reach front teeth. • Certain foods and drinks. • Foods that cling to your teeth for a long time are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva. • These foods include milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips. • Snacking or sipping a lot. • When you snack or sip sugary drinks a lot, you give mouth bacteria more fuel to make acids that attack your teeth and wear them down. • And sipping soda or other acidic drinks throughout the day helps create a continual acid bath over your teeth. • Bedtime baby feeding. • When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other liquids that have sugar, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep. • This feeds bacteria that can cause decay. • This damage often is called baby bottle tooth decay. • Similar damage can occur when toddlers wander around drinking from a sippy cup filled with these beverages. • Not brushing your teeth well. • If you don't clean your teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly, and the first stages of decay and gingivitis can begin. • Not getting enough fluoride. • Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities. • It also can reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. • Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. • It's also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses. • But bottled water usually does not contain fluoride. • Younger or older age. • In the U.S., cavities are common in very young children and teenagers. • Older adults also are at higher risk. • Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more likely to decay. • Older adults also may use more medicines that reduce saliva flow, raising the risk of tooth decay. • Dry mouth. • Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva. • Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth. • Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria. • Certain medicines, some medical conditions, radiation to your head or neck, or certain chemotherapy drugs can raise your risk of cavities by reducing saliva production. • Worn fillings or dental devices. • Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or get rough edges. • This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove. • Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin under them. • Heartburn. • Heartburn, a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause stomach acid to flow into your mouth. • This is called reflux. • It can wear away the enamel of your teeth and cause a lot of damage. • This exposes more of the dentin to bacteria, creating tooth decay. • Your dentist may recommend that you talk with your healthcare professional to see if GERD is causing your enamel loss. • Eating disorders. • Anorexia and bulimia can lead to a lot of tooth erosion and cavities. • Stomach acid from repeated vomiting, called purging, washes over the teeth and begins eating away at the enamel. • Eating disorders also can get in the way of saliva production. • Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously. • And you may think that it doesn't matter if children get cavities in their baby teeth. • But cavities and tooth decay can have serious and lasting complications, even for children who don't have their permanent teeth yet. • Complications of cavities may include: Pain. • Abscess — a bacterial infection that causes a pocket of pus to form in a tooth. • Swelling or pus around a tooth. • Damage or broken teeth. • Chewing problems. • Positioning shifts of teeth after tooth loss. • When cavities and decay become serious, you may have: Pain that makes it hard to live your daily life. • Weight loss or nutrition problems because it's painful or difficult to eat or chew. • Tooth loss, which may affect your appearance, confidence and self-esteem. • In rare cases, a tooth abscess, which can lead to more-serious or even life-threatening infections. • Good oral and dental hygiene can help keep you from getting cavities. • Here are some tips to help prevent cavities. • Ask your dentist which tips are best for you. • Brush with fluoride toothpaste after eating or drinking. • Brush your teeth at least twice a day, and ideally after every meal, using toothpaste with fluoride. • To clean between your teeth, floss or use an interdental cleaner. • This cleaner helps reach areas where a toothbrush can't reach. • Rinse your mouth. • If your dentist feels that you have a high risk of getting cavities, a mouth rinse with fluoride may be recommended. • Visit your dentist regularly. • Get professional teeth cleanings and regular oral exams, which can help prevent problems or spot them early. • Your dentist can recommend a schedule that's best for you. • Consider dental sealants. • A sealant is a protective plastic coating applied to the chewing surface of back teeth. • It seals off grooves and crannies that tend to collect food, protecting tooth enamel from plaque and acid. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sealants for all school-age children. • Sealants may last for several years before they need to be replaced, but they need to be checked regularly. • Drink some tap water. • Most public water supplies have added fluoride, which can reduce tooth decay greatly. • If you drink only bottled water that doesn't contain fluoride, you'll miss out on the benefits of fluoride. • Avoid snacking and sipping a lot. • Whenever you eat or drink beverages other than water, you help your mouth bacteria create acids that can destroy tooth enamel. • If you snack or drink throughout the day, your teeth are under constant attack. • Eat tooth-healthy foods. • Some foods and beverages are better for your teeth than others. • Avoid foods that get stuck in grooves and pits of your teeth for long periods, or brush soon after eating them. • Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables increase saliva flow, and unsweetened coffee, tea and sugar-free gum help wash away food particles. • Consider fluoride treatments. • Your dentist may recommend periodic fluoride treatments, especially if you aren't getting enough fluoride through fluoridated drinking water and other sources. • Your dentist also may recommend custom trays that fit over your teeth to apply prescription fluoride if your risk of tooth decay is very high. • Ask about antiseptic and disinfecting treatments. • If tooth decay is likely — for example, because of a medical condition — your dentist may recommend special antiseptic and disinfecting mouth rinses like chlorhexidine or other treatments to cut down on harmful bacteria in your mouth. • Unless your dentist tells you otherwise, mouth rinses, also called mouthwash, generally are not recommended for children younger than the age of 6 so they don't swallow too much of it. • Combined treatments. • Chewing sugar-free gum along with prescription fluoride and an antibacterial rinse can help reduce the risk of cavities. • But in some people, xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies, may cause gas or diarrhea if consumed in large amounts.",

      "Overview": "Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. • Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye. • If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. • Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a condition called malabsorption. • The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. • It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. • In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms. • There's no definite cure for celiac disease. • But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. • They also may be different in children and adults. • Digestive symptoms for adults include: Diarrhea. • Fatigue. • Weight loss. • Bloating and gas. • Abdominal pain. • Nausea and vomiting. • Constipation. • However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption. • Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia. • Itchy, blistery skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis. • Mouth ulcers. • Headaches and fatigue. • Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment. • Joint pain. • Reduced functioning of the spleen, known as hyposplenism. • Elevated liver enzymes. • Children with celiac disease are more likely than adults to have digestive problems, including: Nausea and vomiting. • Chronic diarrhea. • Swollen belly. • Constipation. • Gas. • Pale, foul-smelling stools. • The inability to absorb nutrients might result in: Failure to thrive for infants. • Damage to tooth enamel. • Weight loss. • Anemia. • Irritability. • Short stature. • Delayed puberty. • Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures. • Gluten intolerance can cause this blistery skin disease. • The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp or buttocks. • This condition is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the skin condition might not cause digestive symptoms. • Health care professionals treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medicine, or both, to control the rash. • Consult your health care team if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. • Consult your child's health care team if your child: Is pale. • Is irritable. • Is failing to grow. • Has a potbelly. • Has foul-smelling, bulky stools. • Be sure to consult your health care team before trying a gluten-free diet. • If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you can change the test results. • Celiac disease tends to run in families. • If someone in your family has the condition, ask a member of your health care team if you should be tested. • Also ask about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes. • Your genes, combined with eating foods with gluten and other factors, can contribute to celiac disease. • However, the precise cause isn't known. • Infant-feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria may contribute, but these causes have not been proved. • Sometimes celiac disease becomes active after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress. • When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hairlike projections, called villi, that line the small intestine. • Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. • If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat. • Celiac disease tends to be more common in people who have: A family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis. • Type 1 diabetes. • Down syndrome, William syndrome or Turner syndrome. • Autoimmune thyroid disease. • Microscopic colitis. • Addison's disease. • Celiac disease that is not treated can lead to: Malnutrition. • This occurs if your small intestine can't absorb enough nutrients. • Malnutrition can lead to anemia and weight loss. • In children, malnutrition can cause slow growth and short stature. • Bone weakening. • In children, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can lead to a softening of the bone, called osteomalacia or rickets. • In adults, it can lead to a loss of bone density, called osteopenia or osteoporosis. • Infertility and miscarriage. • Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can contribute to reproductive issues. • Lactose intolerance. • Damage to your small intestine might cause you abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating or drinking dairy products that contain lactose. • Once your intestine has healed, you might be able to tolerate dairy products again. • Cancer. • People with celiac disease who don't maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer. • Nervous system conditions. • Some people with celiac disease can develop conditions such as seizures or a disease of the nerves to the hands and feet, called peripheral neuropathy. • Some people with celiac disease don't respond to what they consider to be a gluten-free diet. • Nonresponsive celiac disease is often due to contamination of the diet with gluten. • Working with a dietitian can help you learn how to avoid all gluten. • People with nonresponsive celiac disease might have: Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. • Microscopic colitis. • Poor pancreas function, known as pancreatic insufficiency. • Irritable bowel syndrome. • Difficulty digesting sugar found in dairy products (lactose), table sugar (sucrose), or a type of sugar found in honey and fruits (fructose). • Truly refractory celiac disease that is not responding to a gluten-free diet. • In rare instances, the intestinal injury of celiac disease doesn't respond to a strict gluten-free diet. • This is known as refractory celiac disease. • If you still have symptoms after following a gluten-free diet for 6 months to 1 year, you should talk to your health care team to see if you need further testing to look for explanations for your symptoms.",

      "Overview": "Cellulite is a very common, harmless skin condition that causes lumpy, dimpled flesh on the thighs, hips, buttocks and abdomen. • The condition is most prevalent in women. • Many people try, with variable success, to improve the appearance of their skin through weight loss, exercise, massage and creams marketed as a solution to cellulite. • Medically proven treatment options are available as well, though results aren't immediate or long lasting.",
      "Symptoms": "Cellulite looks like dimpled or bumpy skin. • It's sometimes described as having a cottage cheese or orange peel texture. • You can see mild cellulite only if you pinch your skin in an area where you have cellulite, such as your thighs. • Cellulite that is more severe makes the skin appear rumpled and bumpy with areas of peaks and valleys. • Cellulite is most common around the thighs and buttocks, but it can also be found on the breasts, lower abdomen and upper arms. • Treatment isn't necessary. • But if you're concerned about the appearance of your skin, talk with your primary care doctor or a specialist in skin diseases (dermatologist) or plastic surgery about treatment options.",
      "Causes": "Little is known about what causes cellulite. • It involves fibrous connective cords that tether the skin to the underlying muscle, with the fat lying between. • As fat cells accumulate, they push up against the skin, while the long, tough cords pull down. • This creates an uneven surface or dimpling. • In addition, hormonal factors play a large role in the development of cellulite, and genetics determine skin structure, skin texture and body type. • Other factors, such as weight and muscle tone affect whether you have cellulite, though even very fit people can have it.",
      "Risk factors": "Cellulite is much more common in women than in men. • In fact, most women develop some cellulite after puberty. • This is because women's fat is typically distributed in the thighs, hips and buttocks — common areas for cellulite. • Cellulite is also more common with aging, when the skin loses elasticity. • Weight gain can make cellulite more noticeable, but some lean people have cellulite, as well. • It tends to run in families, so genetics might play the biggest role in whether you develop cellulite. • An inactive lifestyle also can increase your chances of having cellulite, as can pregnancy."

      "Overview": "Central nervous system vascular malformations are rare issues with the blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord and their coverings, called membranes. • There are several types of central nervous system vascular malformations, including: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • These are unusual tangles of blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. • AVM can be anywhere in the body. • Most often they occur in or near the brain or the spine. • This type poses the highest risk of brain bleeds and other complications. • Capillary telangiectasias. • These are small blood vessels, called capillaries, that are wider than usual. • Cavernous malformations. • These are blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord that are formed unusually. • They look like mulberries or popcorn. • Dural arteriovenous fistulas. • These are unusual links between arteries and the tough covering over the brain or spinal cord, called dura, and a draining vein. • Venous malformations. • These are unusually enlarged veins in the brain or spinal cord. • They also are called developmental venous anomalies.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of central nervous system vascular malformation and where it's found. • Some vascular malformations have no symptoms. • They're found on imaging for something else. • Symptoms for some central nervous system vascular malformations can include: Bleeding. • Seizures. • Headache. • Brain and nervous system problems, called neurological deficits, that get worse over time. • Neurological deficits can affect speech, vision, balance, memory and other abilities.",
      "Causes": "The cause of central nervous system vascular malformations is unclear. • Some are present at birth, called congenital. • Others come later. • Some genetic conditions can increase the risk of having vascular malformation. • Injury to the central nervous system might be another cause.",
      "Complications": "Central nervous system vascular malformations can damage the brain or spinal cord. • Damage can come from bleeding, called hemorrhage, into nearby tissues. • Vascular malformations also can block oxygen flow to tissues and put pressure on parts of the brain or spinal cord. • Complications can include: Stroke. • Brain damage from a burst blood vessel. • Death. • Learning and behavior problems in children. • Once bleeding occurs, there's a greater risk of having another bleed. • For someone who has a vascular malformation, being pregnant might increase the risk of bleeding."

      "Overview": "Central sleep apnea is a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. • Central sleep apnea occurs because the brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. • This condition is different from obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing stops because the throat muscles relax and block the airway. • Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea. • Central sleep apnea can result from other conditions, such as heart failure and stroke. • Another possible cause is sleeping at a high altitude. • Treatments for central sleep apnea might involve managing existing conditions, using a device to assist breathing or using supplemental oxygen.",
      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms of central sleep apnea include: Observed episodes of not breathing during sleep. • Sudden awakenings with shortness of breath. • Not being able to stay asleep, known as insomnia. • Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. • Trouble focusing. • Mood changes. • Morning headaches. • Snoring. • Although snoring suggests some degree of a blocked airway, snoring also can occur in people with central sleep apnea. • However, snoring may not be as prominent with central sleep apnea as it is with obstructive sleep apnea. • Consult a medical professional if you have — or if your partner notices — any symptoms of central sleep apnea, particularly: Shortness of breath that awakens you from sleep. • Pauses in your breathing during sleep. • Trouble staying asleep. • Excessive daytime drowsiness, which may cause you to fall asleep while you're working, watching television or even driving. • Ask a member of your health care team about any sleep problem that leaves you regularly fatigued, sleepy and irritable. • Excessive daytime drowsiness can be due to other disorders, so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. • Sleepiness during the day may be caused by obstructive sleep apnea, by not allowing yourself time to get enough sleep at night or by sudden attacks of sleep, known as narcolepsy.",
      "Causes": "Central sleep apnea occurs when your brain doesn't transmit signals to your breathing muscles. • The brainstem links the brain to the spinal cord. • It controls many functions, including heart rate and breathing. • Central sleep apnea can be caused by a number of conditions that affect the ability of the brainstem to control breathing. • The cause varies with the type of central sleep apnea you have. • Types include: Cheyne-Stokes breathing. • This type of central sleep apnea is most commonly associated with congestive heart failure or stroke. • During Cheyne-Stokes breathing, breathing effort and airflow gradually rise and then lessen. • During the weakest breathing effort, a total lack of airflow can occur. • Drug-induced apnea. • Taking certain medicines such as opioids can cause breathing to become irregular or stop completely for a short time. • These medicines can be taken by mouth or by shot, also called injection. • They include morphine (MS Contin, Mitigo, others), oxycodone (Roxicodone, Oxycontin, others) and codeine. • High-altitude periodic breathing. • A Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern can occur if you're at a very high altitude. • The change in oxygen at a high altitude can cause fast breathing, known as hyperventilation, followed by taking in too little air. • Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. • Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for treatment. • This condition is known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. • It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas. • Medical condition-induced central sleep apnea. • Several medical conditions, including end-stage kidney disease and stroke, may lead to central sleep apnea. • This type of sleep apnea doesn't involve Cheyne-Stokes breathing. • Primary central sleep apnea, also known as idiopathic sleep apnea. • The cause of this uncommon type of central sleep apnea is not known.",
      "Risk factors": "Certain factors put you at increased risk of central sleep apnea: Sex. • Males are more likely to develop central sleep apnea than are females. • Age. • Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially those older than age 60. • This could be because people older than 60 are likely to have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are linked to central sleep apnea. • Heart disorders. • Heart problems put people at higher risk of central sleep apnea. • An irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, can increase the risk. • Having heart muscles that don't pump enough blood for the body's needs, known as congestive heart failure, also can raise the risk. • Stroke, brain tumor or a structural problem with the brainstem. • These brain conditions can affect the brain's ability to regulate breathing. • High altitude. • Sleeping at an altitude higher than you're used to may increase your risk of sleep apnea. • High-altitude sleep apnea resolves a few weeks after returning to a lower altitude. • Opioid use. • Opioid medicines may increase the risk of central sleep apnea. • CPAP. • Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). • This condition is known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. • It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas. • For some people, complex sleep apnea goes away with continued use of their CPAP device. • Other people may be treated with a different kind of positive airway pressure therapy.",
      "Complications": "Central sleep apnea is a serious medical condition. • Some complications include: Fatigue. • The repeated awakenings associated with sleep apnea make restorative sleep impossible. • People with central sleep apnea often have severe fatigue, daytime drowsiness and irritability. • You might have trouble focusing. • You also may find yourself falling asleep at work, while watching television or even while driving. • Cardiovascular problems. • Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during central sleep apnea can affect heart health. • If you have heart disease, repeated episodes of low blood oxygen increase the risk of irregular heart rhythms."

      "Overview": "Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. • It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth. • Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. • Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. • The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. • Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. • Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these. • Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. • It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. • People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness. • The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. • Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. • Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. • Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. • There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. • The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. • The condition generally stays the same over time.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary greatly. • In some people, cerebral palsy affects the whole body. • In other people, symptoms might only affect one or two limbs or one side of the body. • General symptoms include trouble with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues. • Movement and coordination symptoms may include: Stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes, known as spasticity. • This is the most common movement condition related to cerebral palsy. • Variations in muscle tone, such as being either too stiff or too floppy. • Stiff muscles with regular reflexes, known as rigidity. • Lack of balance and muscle coordination, known as ataxia. • Jerky movements that can't be controlled, known as tremors. • Slow, writhing movements. • Favoring one side of the body, such as only reaching with one hand or dragging a leg while crawling. • Trouble walking. • People with cerebral palsy may walk on their toes or crouch down when they walk. • They also may have a scissors-like walk with their knees crossing. • Or they may have a wide gait or a walk that's not steady. • Trouble with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils. • These symptoms related to speech and eating may occur: Delays in speech development. • Trouble speaking. • Trouble with sucking, chewing or eating. • Drooling or trouble with swallowing. • Some children with cerebral palsy have these symptoms related to development: Delays in reaching motor skills milestones, such as sitting up or crawling. • Learning disabilities. • Intellectual disabilities. • Delayed growth, resulting in smaller size than would be expected. • Damage to the brain can contribute to other neurological symptoms, such as: Seizures, which are symptoms of epilepsy. • Children with cerebral palsy may be diagnosed with epilepsy. • Trouble hearing. • Trouble with vision and changes in eye movements. • Pain or trouble feeling sensations such as touch. • Bladder and bowel issues, including constipation and urinary incontinence. • Mental health conditions, such as emotional conditions and behavior issues. • The brain condition causing cerebral palsy doesn't change with time. • Symptoms usually don't worsen with age. • However, as the child gets older, some symptoms might become more or less clear. • And muscle shortening and muscle rigidity can worsen if not treated aggressively. • Contact your child's health care professional and get a prompt diagnosis if your child has symptoms of a movement condition. • Also see a health professional if your child has delays in development. • See your child's health care professional if you have concerns about episodes of loss of awareness or of irregular bodily movements or posture. • It's also important to contact your child's health care professional if your child has trouble swallowing, poor coordination, eye muscle imbalance or other developmental issues. • Cerebral palsy is caused by irregular brain development or damage to the developing brain. • This usually happens before a child is born, but it can occur at birth or in early infancy. • Often the cause isn't known. • Many factors can lead to changes in brain development. • Some include: Gene changes that result in genetic conditions or differences in brain development. • Maternal infections that affect an unborn baby. • Stroke, which interrupts blood supply to the developing brain. • Bleeding into the brain in the womb or as a newborn. • Infant infections that cause swelling in or around the brain. • Traumatic head injury to an infant, such as from a motor vehicle accident, fall or physical trauma. • Lack of oxygen to the brain related to a hard labor or delivery, although this cause is less common than previously thought. • A number of factors are associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy. • Certain infections or toxic exposures during pregnancy can significantly increase cerebral palsy risk to the baby. • Inflammation triggered by infection or fever can damage the unborn baby's developing brain. • Cytomegalovirus. • This common virus causes flu-like symptoms. • If a mother has her first active infection during pregnancy, it can lead to birth defects. • German measles, known as rubella. • This viral infection can be prevented with a vaccine. • Herpes. • This infection can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, affecting the womb and placenta. • Syphilis. • This is a bacterial infection that's usually spread by sexual contact. • Toxoplasmosis. • This infection is caused by a parasite found in contaminated food, soil and the feces of infected cats. • Zika virus infection. • This infection is spread through mosquito bites and can affect the brain development of an unborn baby. • Intrauterine infections. • This includes infections of the placenta or fetal membranes. • Exposure to toxins. • One example is exposure to methyl mercury. • Other conditions. • Other conditions affecting the mother that can slightly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include thyroid conditions, preeclampsia or seizures. • Illnesses in a newborn baby that can greatly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include: Bacterial meningitis. • This bacterial infection causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. • Viral encephalitis. • This viral infection also causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. • Severe or untreated jaundice. • Jaundice appears as a yellowing of the skin and eyes. • The condition occurs when certain byproducts of \"used\" blood cells aren't filtered from the bloodstream. • Bleeding into the brain. • This condition is commonly caused by the baby having a stroke in the womb or in early infancy. • The potential contribution from each is limited, but these pregnancy and birth factors may increase the risk of cerebral palsy risk: Low birth weight. • Babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) are at higher risk of developing cerebral palsy. • This risk increases as birth weight drops. • Multiple babies. • Cerebral palsy risk increases with the number of babies sharing the uterus. • The risk also can be related to the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. • If one or more of the babies die, the survivors' risk of cerebral palsy increases. • Premature birth. • Babies born prematurely are at higher risk of cerebral palsy. • The earlier a baby is born, the greater the cerebral palsy risk. • Delivery complications. • Events during labor and delivery may increase the risk of cerebral palsy. • Muscle weakness, muscle spasticity and trouble with coordination can contribute to complications in childhood or in adulthood, including: Contracture. • Contracture is muscle tissue shortening due to severe muscle tightening. • This can be the result of spasticity. • Contracture can slow bone growth, cause bones to bend, and result in joint changes, dislocation or partial dislocation. • These can include a dislocated hip, a curved spine or other bone changes. • Malnutrition. • Trouble with swallowing and feeding can make it hard to get enough nutrition, particularly for an infant. • This can impair growth and weaken bones. • Some children or adults need a feeding tube to get enough nutrition. • Mental health conditions. • People with cerebral palsy might have mental health conditions, such as depression. • Social isolation and the challenges of coping with disabilities can contribute to depression. • Behavior issues also can occur. • Heart and lung disease. • People with cerebral palsy may develop heart disease, lung disease and breathing conditions. • Trouble swallowing can result in respiratory issues, such as aspiration pneumonia. • Aspiration pneumonia happens when a child inhales food, drink, saliva or vomit into the lungs. • Osteoarthritis. • Pressure on joints or misalignment of joints from muscle spasticity may lead to this painful bone disease. • Osteoporosis. • Fractures due to low bone density can result from lack of mobility, poor nutrition and anti-seizure medicines. • Other complications. • These can include sleep conditions, chronic pain, skin breakdown, intestinal issues and issues with oral health. • Often cerebral palsy can't be prevented, but you can reduce risks. • If you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, take these steps to minimize pregnancy complications: Make sure you're vaccinated. • Getting vaccinated against diseases such as rubella might prevent an infection. • It's best to make sure you're fully vaccinated before getting pregnant. • Take care of yourself. • The healthier you are heading into a pregnancy, the less likely you'll be to develop an infection that results in cerebral palsy. • Seek early and continuous prenatal care. • See your health care professional regularly during pregnancy. • Proper prenatal care can reduce health risks to you and your unborn baby. • Seeing your health care professional regularly can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight and infections. • Avoid alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. • These have been linked to cerebral palsy risk. • Rarely, cerebral palsy can be caused by brain damage that occurs in childhood. • Practice good general safety. • Prevent head injuries by providing your child with a car seat, bicycle helmet, safety rails on the bed and appropriate supervision.",

      "Overview": "Cervical cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix. • The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. • Various strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers. • HPV is a common infection that's passed through sexual contact. • When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. • In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. • This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells. • You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects against HPV infection. • When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. • Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. • Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. • Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. • Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.",
      "Symptoms": "When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms. • As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as: Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause. • Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual. • Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor. • Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other health care professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. • Cervical cancer begins when healthy cells in the cervix develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. • The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This causes too many cells. • The cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • Most cervical cancers are caused by HPV. • HPV is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. • For most people, the virus never causes problems. • It usually goes away on its own. • For some, though, the virus can cause changes in the cells that may lead to cancer. • Cervical cancer is divided into types based on the type of cell in which the cancer begins. • The main types of cervical cancer are: Squamous cell carcinoma. • This type of cervical cancer begins in thin, flat cells, called squamous cells. • The squamous cells line the outer part of the cervix. • Most cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. • Adenocarcinoma. • This type of cervical cancer begins in the column-shaped gland cells that line the cervical canal. • Sometimes, both types of cells are involved in cervical cancer. • Very rarely, cancer occurs in other cells in the cervix. • Risk factors for cervical cancer include: Smoking tobacco. • Smoking increases the risk of cervical cancer. • When HPV infections happen in people who smoke, the infections tend to last longer and are less likely to go away. • HPV causes most cervical cancers. • Increasing number of sexual partners. • The greater your number of sexual partners, and the greater your partner's number of sexual partners, the greater your chance of getting HPV. • Early sexual activity. • Having sex at an early age increases your risk of HPV. • Other sexually transmitted infections. • Having other sexually transmitted infections, also called STIs, increases the risk of HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer. • Other STIs that increase the risk include herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HIV/AIDS. • A weakened immune system. • You may be more likely to develop cervical cancer if your immune system is weakened by another health condition and you have HPV. • Exposure to miscarriage prevention medicine. • If your parent took a medicine called diethylstilbestrol, also known as DES, while pregnant, your risk of cervical cancer might be increased. • This medicine was used in the 1950s to prevent miscarriage. • It's linked to a type of cervical cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma. • To reduce your risk of cervical cancer: Ask your doctor about the HPV vaccine. • Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. • Ask your health care team if an HPV vaccine is right for you. • Have routine Pap tests. • Pap tests can detect precancerous conditions of the cervix. • These conditions can be monitored or treated in order to prevent cervical cancer. • Most medical organizations suggest beginning routine Pap tests at age 21 and repeating them every few years. • Practice safe sex. • Reduce your risk of cervical cancer by taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections. • This may include using a condom every time you have sex and limiting the number of sexual partners you have. • Don't smoke. • If you don't smoke, don't start. • If you do smoke, talk to a health care professional about ways to help you quit.",

      "Symptoms": "Most often, cervicitis causes no signs and symptoms, and you may only learn you have the condition after a pelvic exam performed by your doctor for another reason. • If you do have signs and symptoms, they may include: Large amounts of unusual vaginal discharge Frequent, painful urination Pain during sex Bleeding between menstrual periods Vaginal bleeding after sex, not associated with a menstrual period See your doctor if you have: Persistent, unusual vaginal discharge Nonmenstrual vaginal bleeding Pain during sex Possible causes of cervicitis include: Sexually transmitted infections. • Most often, the bacterial and viral infections that cause cervicitis are transmitted by sexual contact. • Cervicitis can result from common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and genital herpes. • Allergic reactions. • An allergy, either to contraceptive spermicides or to latex in condoms, may lead to cervicitis. • A reaction to feminine hygiene products, such as douches or feminine deodorants, also can cause cervicitis. • Bacterial overgrowth. • An overgrowth of some of the bacteria that are normally present in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can lead to cervicitis. • You're at greater risk of cervicitis if you: Engage in high-risk sexual behavior, such as unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners or sex with someone who engages in high-risk behaviors Began having sexual intercourse at an early age Have a history of sexually transmitted infections Your cervix acts as a barrier to keep bacteria and viruses from entering your uterus. • When the cervix is infected, there's an increased risk that the infection will travel into your uterus. • Cervicitis that's caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia can spread to the uterine lining and the fallopian tubes, resulting in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the female reproductive organs that can cause fertility problems if left untreated. • Cervicitis can also increase the risk of getting HIV from an infected sexual partner. • To reduce your risk of cervicitis from sexually transmitted infections, use condoms consistently and correctly each time you have sex. • Condoms are very effective against the spread of STIs, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, which can lead to cervicitis. • Being in a long-term relationship in which both you and your uninfected partner are committed to having sex with each other exclusively can lower your odds of an STI.",

      "Overview": "Chemo brain is a common term people with cancer use to describe trouble with thinking and memory that can happen during and after cancer treatment. • Chemo brain also can be called chemo fog, cancer-related cognitive impairment or cognitive dysfunction. • Chemo brain is a widely used term because this condition was first reported in people having chemotherapy treatments. • But experts don't fully know the causes of these concentration and memory changes. • There's likely more than one cause. • No matter the cause, chemo brain can be a tough side effect of cancer and its treatment. • Researchers are working to understand the memory changes that people with cancer have.",
      "Symptoms": "Chemo brain signs and symptoms include changes in memory and thinking. • Symptoms of chemo brain linked to memory may include: Trouble recalling what you've said to others. • Trouble recalling what you've seen, such as images or lists of words. • Trouble recalling what's happened recently, called short-term memory issues. • Symptoms of chemo brain linked to thinking may include: Trouble finding the right words. • Trouble learning new skills. • Trouble doing more than one thing at a time. • Mental fog. • Short attention span. • Taking longer than usual to do routine tasks. • If you have trouble with memory or thinking, make an appointment with your healthcare professional. • Keep a journal of your symptoms to help your healthcare professional know how your memory issues affect your life.",
      "Causes": "There are many causes of changes in memory and thinking in people with cancer. • These chemo brain symptoms can be caused by the cancer, treatment for the cancer, complications of cancer treatment and other things. • Cancer-related causes may include: The stress of a cancer diagnosis, which can cause worry and distress. • These can add to issues with memory and thinking. • Chemicals some cancers make that affect memory. • Cancers that begin in the brain or spread to the brain may cause changes in thinking. • Bone marrow transplant, also called stem cell transplant. • Chemotherapy. • Hormone therapy. • Immunotherapy. • Radiation therapy. • Surgery. • Targeted therapy. • Low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen to the body's tissues, called anemia. • Weakness and tiredness. • Infection. • Menopause or other hormonal changes caused by cancer treatment. • Sleep issues. • Pain due to cancer treatments. • Some people may be more likely to get chemo brain based on genetic makeup. • Medicines for other cancer-related symptoms, such as pain medicines. • Other medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid conditions, depression, anxiety and not getting enough nutrients.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of chemo brain and memory changes in people with cancer include: Brain cancer. • Cancer that spreads to the brain. • Higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation. • Radiation therapy to the brain. • Younger age at time of cancer diagnosis and treatment. • Older age.",
      "Complications": "Some people with chemo brain have thinking and memory changes that affect their ability to work. • Most people with cancer can return to work at least part-time. • But some may find that tasks now take extra focus or time. • Others may not be able to return to work. • If you have trouble focusing on what you need to do for your job, tell your healthcare professional. • Your healthcare professional may send you to a specialist who can help, such as an occupational therapist. • This person can help find ways to make it easier to do your job. • Rarely, people with chemo brain can't work. • Ask your healthcare team to refer you to a social worker. • This person may help you find programs that support people who can't work because of a health condition."

      "Overview": "Chest pain is pain or discomfort in the area between the neck and belly. • Chest pain may be sharp or dull. • It might come and go, or you might always feel the pain. • The exact symptoms depend on the cause. • Many different things can cause chest pain. • The most life-threatening causes involve the heart or lungs. • So it's important to get medical help for an accurate diagnosis. • If you think your chest pain is due to a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.",
      "Symptoms": "Chest pain symptoms depend on the cause. • Chest pain is often related to heart disease. • Chest pain symptoms due to a heart attack or another heart condition may include: Pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching in the chest. • Pain that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or upper belly. • Shortness of breath. • Fatigue. • Heartburn or indigestion. • Cold sweats. • Lightheadedness. • Fast heartbeat. • Nausea. • It can be hard to tell if chest pain is due to a heart condition or something else. • Usually, chest pain is less likely due to a heart condition if it happens with: A sour taste or a feeling of food coming back up into the mouth. • Trouble swallowing. • Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position. • Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough. • Tenderness when you push on your chest. • Pain that continues for many hours or days. • The classic symptoms of heartburn — a painful, burning sensation behind the breastbone — can be due to a health condition affecting the heart or the stomach. • If you have new or unexplained chest pain or think you're having a heart attack, call 911 or emergency medical help right away. • Never ignore the symptoms of a heart attack. • If you can't get an ambulance or emergency vehicle to come to you, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. • Drive yourself only if you have no other way to get there. • Chest pain has many possible causes. • Some heart-related causes of chest pain are: Angina. • This is any chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. • It is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. • Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease. • Unstable angina can cause a heart attack or near heart attack. • Heart attack. • A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked. • It can cause angina chest pain. • Emergency treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death. • Aortic dissection. • This life-threatening condition involves the body's main artery, called the aorta. • If the inner layers of the aorta separate, blood is forced between the layers. • This can cause the aorta to rupture. • Inflammation of the sac around the heart, called pericarditis. • This condition usually causes sharp pain that gets worse when taking a breath or lying down. • Chest pain can be caused by diseases or disorders of the digestive system, including: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). • In this condition, stomach acid washes up from the stomach into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. • That tube is called the esophagus. • GERD can cause a burning feeling in the chest, called heartburn. • Swallowing disorders. • Diseases that affect the esophagus can make swallowing difficult and even painful. • This may lead to chest pain. • Gallbladder or pancreas disease. • Gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas can cause stomach pain that spreads to the chest. • Many lung conditions can cause chest pain, including: A blood clot in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism. • A blood clot that gets stuck in a lung artery can block blood flow to lung tissue. • Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism may feel like a heart attack. • Irritation of the thin layers of tissue that separate your lungs from your chest wall, called pleurisy. • This condition causes sharp chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in or cough. • Collapsed lung. • A collapsed lung happens when air leaks into the space between the lung and the ribs. • It also is called a pneumothorax. • Chest pain due a collapsed lung typically starts suddenly. • It can last for hours. • It usually causes shortness of breath. • High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension. • This condition affects the arteries carrying blood to the lungs. • It can cause chest pain or pressure. • Some types of chest pain are due to injury or damage to the structures that make up the chest wall. • These conditions include: Costochondritis. • This is inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone. • It can cause chest pain that might feel like a heart attack. • The pain is most commonly felt on the left-hand side of the body. • Injured ribs. • A bruised or broken rib can cause chest pain. • Long-term pain syndromes. • Conditions such as fibromyalgia, which can make muscles sore, may cause long-term pain that affects the chest area. • Chest pain also can be caused by: Panic attack. • If you feel intense fear with chest pain, you may be having a panic attack. • Panic attack symptoms also include a fast, pounding heartbeat, fast breathing, a lot of sweating, shortness of breath, nausea and dizziness. • It can be hard to tell the difference between a heart attack and a panic attack. • Always get medical help if you aren't sure of the cause of chest pain. • Shingles. • This is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. • It can cause very bad pain and a band of blisters from the back around to the chest area. • Nerve pain. • Some people with pinched nerves in the middle back may feel chest pain.",

      "Overview": "Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) is a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. • It occurs when part of the skull is misshapen or smaller than is typical. • The skull presses on the brain and forces it downward. • Chiari malformation is not common, but increased use of imaging tests has led to more diagnoses. • Health care professionals group Chiari malformation into three types. • The type depends on the anatomy of the brain tissue that is pushed into the spinal canal. • The type also depends on whether there are developmental changes of the brain or spine. • Chiari malformation type 1 develops as the skull and brain are growing. • Symptoms may not occur until late childhood or adulthood. • The pediatric forms of Chiari malformation are type 2 and type 3. • These types are present at birth, which is known as congenital. • Treatment of Chiari malformation depends on the type and the symptoms. • Regular monitoring, medicines and surgery are treatment options. • Sometimes no treatment is needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with Chiari malformation have no symptoms and don't need treatment. • They learn they have Chiari malformation only when tests are performed for unrelated conditions. • But some types of Chiari malfunction can cause symptoms. • The more common types of Chiari malformation are: Type 1 Type 2 These types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3. • But symptoms still can disrupt life. • In Chiari malformation type 1, symptoms usually appear during late childhood or adulthood. • Bad headaches are the classic symptom of Chiari malformation. • They generally occur after sudden coughing, sneezing or straining. • People with Chiari malformation type 1 also can experience: Neck pain. • Unsteady walk and trouble with balance. • Poor hand coordination. • Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet. • Dizziness. • Trouble swallowing. • This sometimes happens with gagging, choking and vomiting. • Speech changes, such as hoarseness. • Less often, people with Chiari malformation may experience: Ringing or buzzing in the ears, known as tinnitus. • Weakness. • Slow heart rhythm. • Curvature of the spine, known as scoliosis. • The curvature is related to spinal cord impairment. • Trouble with breathing. • This includes central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep. • In Chiari malformation type 2, a greater amount of tissue extends into the spinal canal compared with that in Chiari malformation type 1. • Symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. • Chiari malformation type 2 nearly always occurs with myelomeningocele. • In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don't close properly before birth. • Symptoms may include: Changes in breathing pattern. • Trouble swallowing, such as gagging. • Quick downward eye movements. • Weakness in the arms. • Chiari malformation type 2 is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy. • It also may be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy. • Chiari malformation type 3 is the most serious type of the condition. • A portion of the lower back part of the brain, known as the cerebellum, or the brainstem extend through an opening in the skull. • This form of Chiari malformation is diagnosed at birth or during pregnancy with an ultrasound. • Chiari malformation type 3 causes brain and nervous system issues and has a higher rate of death. • See a health care professional if you or your child has any of the symptoms that may be associated with Chiari malformation. • Many symptoms of Chiari malformation also can be caused by other conditions. • A full medical evaluation is important. • Chiari malformation type 1 occurs when part of the skull is too small or is misshapen. • This part of the skull contains the area of the brain called the cerebellum. • The skull puts pressure on and crowds the brain. • As a result, the lower part of the cerebellum known as the tonsils are pushed into the upper spinal canal. • Chiari malformation type 2 is nearly always associated with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. • When the cerebellum is pushed into the upper spinal canal, it can interfere with the usual flow of cerebrospinal fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord. • Cerebrospinal fluid can build up in the brain or spinal cord. • Or it can cause signals transmitted from the brain to the body to be blocked. • Also, the pressure from the cerebellum on the spinal cord or lower brainstem can cause symptoms. • There's evidence that Chiari malformation runs in some families. • However, research into a possible hereditary component is still in its early phase. • In some people, Chiari malformation may have no symptoms and they don't need treatment. • In others, Chiari malformation gets worse over time and leads to serious complications. • Complications may include: Hydrocephalus. • Hydrocephalus occurs when too much fluid builds up in the brain. • This can cause trouble with thinking. • People with hydrocephalus may need a flexible tube called a shunt placed. • The shunt diverts and drains excess cerebrospinal fluid to a different area of the body. • Spina bifida. • Spina bifida is a condition in which the spinal cord or its covering isn't fully developed. • Part of the spinal cord is exposed, which can cause serious conditions such as paralysis. • People with Chiari malformation type 2 usually have a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. • Syringomyelia. • Some people with Chiari malformation also develop a condition called syringomyelia. • In people with this condition, a cavity or cyst called a syrinx forms within the spinal column. • As the syrinx grows, it can press on the nerves and cause pain, weakness and stiffness. • Tethered cord syndrome. • In this condition, the spinal cord attaches to the spine and causes the spinal cord to stretch. • This can cause serious nerve and muscle damage in the lower body.",

      "Overview": "Chickenpox is an illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. • It brings on an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. • Chickenpox spreads very easily to people who haven't had the disease or haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine. • Chickenpox used to be a widespread problem, but today the vaccine protects children from it. • The chickenpox vaccine is a safe way to prevent this illness and the other health problems that can happen during it.",
      "Symptoms": "The rash caused by chickenpox appears 10 to 21 days after you're exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. • The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. • Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include: Fever. • Loss of appetite. • Headache. • Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell. • Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: Raised bumps called papules, which break out over a few days. • Small fluid-filled blisters called vesicles, which form in about one day and then break and leak. • Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take a few more days to heal. • New bumps keep showing up for several days. • So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. • You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. • And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. • The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. • But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. • Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. • They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina. • If you think you or your child might have chickenpox, call your health care provider. • Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms. • You may need medicines that can help fight off the virus or treat other health problems that can happen because of chickenpox. • To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment. • Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox. • Also, let your provider know if: The rash spreads to one or both eyes. • The rash gets very warm or tender. • This might be a sign that the skin is infected with bacteria. • You have more serious symptoms along with the rash. • Watch for dizziness, new confusion, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, shakiness, loss of the ability to use muscles together, a cough that becomes worse, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C). • You live with people who've never had chickenpox and haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine yet. • Someone in your household is pregnant. • You live with someone who has a disease or takes medicines that affect the immune system. • A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox. • It can spread through direct contact with the rash. • It also can spread when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in the air droplets. • Your risk of getting infected with the virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. • It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated. • Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. • If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. • You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. • A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare. • Chickenpox is often a mild disease. • But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including: Infected skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream caused by bacteria. • Dehydration, when the body runs too low on water and other fluids. • Pneumonia, an illness in one or both lungs. • Swelling of the brain called encephalitis. • Toxic shock syndrome, a dangerous complication of some illnesses caused by bacteria. • Reye's syndrome, a disease that causes swelling in the brain and liver. • This can happen in children and teens who take aspirin during chickenpox. • In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death. • People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include: Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine. • This includes children under age 1, who have not yet had the vaccine. • Teens and adults. • Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox. • People who smoke. • People with cancer or HIV who are taking medication that has an effect on the immune system. • People with a chronic condition, such as asthma, who take medicine that calms immune response. • Or those who have had an organ transplant and take medicine to limit the immune system's action. • Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies. • When a pregnant person catches chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, the baby has a higher risk of getting a life-threatening infection. • If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your health care provider about these risks. • If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of a complication called shingles. • The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. • Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. • The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems. • The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. • This is called postherpetic neuralgia. • In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. • The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. • Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax. • Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. • Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles. • The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox. • In the United States, experts from the CDC report that two doses of the vaccine prevent illness over 90% of the time. • Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder. • In the United States, two chickenpox vaccines are licensed for use: Varivax contains only the chickenpox vaccine. • It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age 1 or older. • ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. • It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. • This is also called the MMRV vaccine. • In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. • This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children. • For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. • Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines. • Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. • The doses should be given at least three months apart. • People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. • It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. • This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age. • If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out. • Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States. • Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox. • Do not get the chickenpox vaccine if you're pregnant. • If you decide to get vaccinated before pregnancy, don't try to get pregnant during the series of shots or for one month after the last dose of the vaccine. • Other people also shouldn't get the vaccine, or they should wait. • Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you: Have a weaker immune system. • This includes people who have HIV or take medicines that have an effect on the immune system. • Are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. • Have any kind of cancer or are getting cancer treatment with radiation or medicines. • Recently received blood from a donor or other blood products. • Talk to your provider if you're not sure whether you need the vaccine. • If you plan on getting pregnant, ask your provider if you're up to date on your vaccines. • Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe. • Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have found that it's safe and it works well. • Side effects are often mild. • They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot. • Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever.",
      "Causes": "A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox. • It can spread through direct contact with the rash. • It also can spread when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in the air droplets.",
      "Risk factors": "Your risk of getting infected with the virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. • It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated. • Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. • If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. • You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. • A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.",
      "Complications": "Chickenpox is often a mild disease. • But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including: Infected skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream caused by bacteria. • Dehydration, when the body runs too low on water and other fluids. • Pneumonia, an illness in one or both lungs. • Swelling of the brain called encephalitis. • Toxic shock syndrome, a dangerous complication of some illnesses caused by bacteria. • Reye's syndrome, a disease that causes swelling in the brain and liver. • This can happen in children and teens who take aspirin during chickenpox. • In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death. • People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include: Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine. • This includes children under age 1, who have not yet had the vaccine. • Teens and adults. • Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox. • People who smoke. • People with cancer or HIV who are taking medication that has an effect on the immune system. • People with a chronic condition, such as asthma, who take medicine that calms immune response. • Or those who have had an organ transplant and take medicine to limit the immune system's action. • Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies. • When a pregnant person catches chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, the baby has a higher risk of getting a life-threatening infection. • If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your health care provider about these risks. • If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of a complication called shingles. • The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. • Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. • The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems. • The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. • This is called postherpetic neuralgia. • In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. • The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. • Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax. • Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. • Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles.",
      "Prevention": "The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox. • In the United States, experts from the CDC report that two doses of the vaccine prevent illness over 90% of the time. • Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder. • In the United States, two chickenpox vaccines are licensed for use: Varivax contains only the chickenpox vaccine. • It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age 1 or older. • ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. • It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. • This is also called the MMRV vaccine. • In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. • This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children. • For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. • Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines. • Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. • The doses should be given at least three months apart. • People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. • It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. • This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age. • If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out. • Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States. • Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox. • Do not get the chickenpox vaccine if you're pregnant. • If you decide to get vaccinated before pregnancy, don't try to get pregnant during the series of shots or for one month after the last dose of the vaccine. • Other people also shouldn't get the vaccine, or they should wait. • Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you: Have a weaker immune system. • This includes people who have HIV or take medicines that have an effect on the immune system. • Are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. • Have any kind of cancer or are getting cancer treatment with radiation or medicines. • Recently received blood from a donor or other blood products. • Talk to your provider if you're not sure whether you need the vaccine. • If you plan on getting pregnant, ask your provider if you're up to date on your vaccines. • Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe. • Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have found that it's safe and it works well. • Side effects are often mild. • They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot. • Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever."

      "Overview": "Chilblains (CHILL-blayns) is a condition that causes inflamed swollen patches and blistering on the hands and feet. • It's caused by exposure to damp air that's cold but not freezing. • Symptoms may show up a few hours after being in the cold. • Chilblains can be prevented by limiting your time in the cold, dressing warmly and covering exposed skin. • If you do get chilblains, keeping the skin warm and dry can help ease the symptoms. • Chilblains, also known as perniosis, usually clears up in 2 or 3 weeks, especially if the weather gets warmer. • You may get the symptoms each cold season for years. • The condition doesn't usually result in permanent injury.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of chilblains include: Small, itchy areas on your skin, often on your feet or hands. • Sores or blistering. • Swelling. • Pain or stinging. • Changes in skin color. • Seek medical care for chilblains if you: Have symptoms that are long lasting or go away then flare. • Think you might have an infection. • Have symptoms that aren't improving after two weeks of home care. • Have symptoms that extend into the warm season. • Aren't sure whether you were in below-freezing temperatures, as you might have frostbite.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of chilblains is unknown. • They may be an unusual reaction of your body to cold followed by rewarming. • Rewarming of cold skin can cause small blood vessels under the skin to expand more quickly than nearby larger blood vessels can handle.",
      "Risk factors": "The following factors increase the risk of chilblains: Wearing clothing and shoes that are tight or expose skin to the cold. • Wearing tightfitting clothing and shoes in cold, damp weather may make you more susceptible to chilblains. • Being a young woman. • This condition is most common in females between the ages of 15 and 30. • Being underweight. • This condition is most common in people with a low body mass. • Living in cold, humid areas. • Your risk of chilblains is higher if you live in an area with high humidity and cold but not freezing temperatures. • Having certain medical conditions. • These include Raynaud's phenomenon, connective tissue disease and SARS-CoV-2.",
      "Complications": "Chilblains symptoms that are long-lasting and develop after repeated exposure to cold and damp conditions can cause scarring and thin skin.",
      "Prevention": "To prevent chilblains: Avoid or limit your exposure to the cold. • When you come in from the cold, rewarm the skin gradually. • Dress in layers of loose clothing and wear mittens, a scarf and a hat, and warm, water-resistant footwear. • Cover all exposed skin as completely as possible when going outside in cold weather. • Keep your hands, feet and face dry and warm. • Keep your home and workplace comfortably warm. • Don't smoke."

      "Overview": "Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a rare speech disorder. • Children with this disorder have trouble controlling their lips, jaws and tongues when speaking. • In CAS, the brain has trouble planning for speech movement. • The brain isn't able to properly direct the movements needed for speech. • The speech muscles aren't weak, but the muscles don't form words the right way. • To speak correctly, the brain has to make plans that tell the speech muscles how to move the lips, jaw and tongue. • The movements usually result in accurate sounds and words spoken at the proper speed and rhythm. • CAS affects this process. • CAS is often treated with speech therapy. • During speech therapy, a speech-language pathologist teaches the child to practice the correct way to say words, syllables and phrases.",
      "Symptoms": "Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have a variety of speech symptoms. • Symptoms vary depending on a child's age and the severity of the speech problems. • CAS can result in: Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months. • Speaking first words late, typically after ages 12 to 18 months old. • Using a limited number of consonants and vowels. • Often leaving out sounds when speaking. • Using speech that is hard to understand. • These symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years. • Symptoms at this age may indicate suspected CAS. • Suspected CAS means a child may potentially have this speech disorder. • The child's speech development should be watched to determine if therapy should begin. • Children usually produce more speech between ages 2 and 4. • Signs that may indicate CAS include: Vowel and consonant distortions. • Pauses between syllables or words. • Voicing errors, such as \"pie\" sounding like \"bye.\" Many children with CAS have trouble getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound. • They also may have a hard time moving smoothly to the next sound. • Many children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or trouble with word order. • Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS, which helps to make a diagnosis. • However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. • It's hard to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other disorders. • Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. • Those associated with CAS include: Trouble moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another. • Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to try to make the correct movement for speech sounds. • Vowel distortions, such as trying to use the correct vowel but saying it incorrectly. • Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing \"banana\" as \"BUH-nan-uh\" instead of \"buh-NAN-uh.\" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying \"BUH-NAN-UH.\" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables. • Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time. • Having a hard time imitating simple words. • Voicing errors, such as saying \"down\" instead of \"town.\" Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the symptoms may overlap. • These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. • A child with an articulation or phonological disorder has trouble learning how to make and use specific sounds. • Unlike in CAS, the child doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak. • Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. • Articulation or phonological speech errors may include: Substituting sounds. • The child might say \"fum\" instead of \"thumb,\" \"wabbit\" instead of \"rabbit\" or \"tup\" instead of \"cup.\" Leaving out final consonants. • A child with CAS might say \"duh\" instead of \"duck\" or \"uh\" instead of \"up.\" Stopping the airstream. • The child might say \"tun\" instead of \"sun\" or \"doo\" instead of \"zoo.\" Simplifying sound combinations. • The child might say \"ting\" instead of \"string\" or \"fog\" instead of \"frog.\" Dysarthria is a speech disorder that occurs because the speech muscles are weak. • Making speech sounds is hard because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as they do during typical speech. • People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice. • Or they may have slurred or slow speech. • Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. • However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be hard to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.",
      "Causes": "Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) has a number of possible causes. • But often a cause can't be determined. • There usually isn't an observable problem in the brain of a child with CAS. • However, CAS can be the result of brain conditions or injury. • These may include a stroke, infections or traumatic brain injury. • CAS also may occur as a symptom of a genetic disorder, syndrome or metabolic condition. • CAS is sometimes referred to as developmental apraxia. • But children with CAS don't make typical developmental sound errors and they don't grow out of CAS. • This is unlike children with delayed speech or developmental disorders who typically follow patterns in speech and sounds development but at a slower pace than usual.",
      "Risk factors": "Changes in the FOXP2 gene appear to increase the risk of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and other speech and language disorders. • The FOXP2 gene may be involved in how certain nerves and pathways in the brain develop. • Researchers continue to study how changes in the FOXP2 gene may affect motor coordination and speech and language processing in the brain. • Other genes also may impact motor speech development.",
      "Complications": "Many children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) have other problems that affect their ability to communicate. • These problems aren't due to CAS, but they may be seen along with CAS. • Symptoms or problems that are often present along with CAS include: Delayed language. • This may include trouble understanding speech, reduced vocabulary, or not using correct grammar when putting words together in a phrase or sentence. • Delays in intellectual and motor development and problems with reading, spelling and writing. • Trouble with gross and fine motor movement skills or coordination. • Trouble using communication in social interactions.",
      "Prevention": "Diagnosing and treating childhood apraxia of speech at an early stage may reduce the risk of long-term persistence of the problem. • If your child experiences speech problems, have a speech-language pathologist evaluate your child as soon as you notice any speech problems."

      "Overview": "Childhood obesity is a serious health condition that involves having excess body fat early in life. • The extra weight often starts children on the path to other health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. • Childhood obesity also can lead to poor self-esteem and depression. • The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't straightforward or simply based on how children look. • And various factors can play a part in causing this condition. • Some factors may be within a family's ability to change, such as eating and physical activity habits. • Many other possible factors can't be changed, such those related to genes and hormones. • You can help manage or prevent childhood obesity by having your whole family regularly eat balanced meals and snacks. • It also helps for the whole family to lead an active lifestyle. • Steps such as these help protect your child's health now and in the future.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of childhood obesity aren't clear-cut. • Not all children who carry extra pounds are overweight. • Some children have larger than average body frames. • And it's typical for children to carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. • So you might not know if weight is a concern based on how your child looks. • A measurement called the body mass index (BMI) helps healthcare professionals check for overweight status and obese status. • A child's BMI is based on the child's weight and height compared with those of other children the same age and sex using growth charts. • Speak with your child's healthcare professional about how your child's BMI fits with other clues of children's health. • For instance, growth patterns, eating and activity habits, stress, sleep, and family history also play a key role in health. • Other tests also can help your child's healthcare professional figure out if your child's weight might pose health risks. • If you're worried that your child is putting on too much weight, talk with your child's healthcare professional. • Get a healthcare checkup right away if your child also has any of the following symptoms: Headaches that don't go away for a long time. • High blood pressure. • Extreme thirst and frequent urination. • Breathing that starts and stops many times during sleep. • Poor growth compared with other children of the same sex and age.",
      "Causes": "Childhood obesity is a complex condition. • Various factors can play a part in causing it. • These include: Genetic and hormonal factors. • Food access. • Stress. • Sleep. • Social and economic factors. • Eating and physical activity habits.",
      "Risk factors": "Many risk factors make childhood obesity more likely. • Some factors that might be within your family's ability to change include the following: Eating habits. • Frequently eating foods that have lots of added sugar, saturated fat or sodium can cause your child to gain weight. • These include fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks. • Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain. • So can sugary drinks such as sodas, fruit juices and sports drinks. • These types of foods and drinks are found everywhere, and they're designed to appeal to the taste buds. • It's OK to enjoy treats such as these once in a while. • Try to eat or drink them slowly and mindfully, paying attention to each bite or sip. • And be sure to look at the serving sizes listed on the labels. • Try not to have more than those amounts in one sitting. • Not enough movement. • Children who don't get enough daily movement are more likely to gain weight. • So encourage your child or teen to get at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day. • Too much time spent being inactive also plays a part in weight gain. • Examples of being inactive include sitting to watch TV, play video games or use lots of social media. • TV and online shows also may feature junk food commercials or ads. • If your child is age 2 or older, try to limit leisure screen time not used for schoolwork to no more than two hours a day. • If your child is younger than 2, don't let your child have any screen time. • Mental health factors. • Personal stress and family stress can raise a child's risk of obesity. • Ongoing stress can cause the body to make high amounts of hormones such as cortisol. • High levels of these hormones can cause feelings of increased hunger. • They also can trigger cravings for foods that have lots of fat and added sugar. • If you think your child has too much stress, talk with your child's healthcare professional. • You may be referred to a counselor or another mental healthcare professional who can test your child and offer treatment if needed. • Certain medicines. • Some prescription medicines can raise the risk of obesity. • They include prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant), propranolol (Inderal LA, Hemangeol), quetiapine (Seroquel), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol, others), medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and risperidone (Risperdal). • Your child's healthcare professional can review the medicines that your child takes. • If a certain medicine might be causing weight gain, the healthcare professional might change the dose or switch medicines. • Some other factors for childhood obesity may be out of a parent's ability to control. • They include the following: Family factors. • If your child comes from a family of people who tend to gain weight easily, your child may be more likely to put on weight. • Genes and hormones. • Sometimes, changes to certain genes can play a part in childhood obesity. • So can conditions linked with hormones and many other processes that happen inside the body. • Social and economic factors. • People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. • As a result, their main access to foods may be convenience foods that don't spoil quickly. • These include frozen meals, crackers and cookies. • Access to fresh produce, meats and other proteins, and whole grain foods may be limited. • And access to safe places for movement activities and outdoor hobbies also may be limited.",
      "Complications": "Childhood obesity often causes health concerns and conditions known as complications. • These can affect a child's physical, social and mental well-being. • Physical complications of childhood obesity can include: Type 2 diabetes. • This long-term condition affects the way the body uses sugar, also called glucose. • Obesity and an inactive lifestyle raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. • High cholesterol and high blood pressure. • A poor diet can cause one or both of these conditions. • High cholesterol and high blood pressure can play a part in the buildup of plaques in the arteries. • The buildup can cause arteries to narrow and harden. • And that may lead to a heart attack or stroke later in life. • Joint pain. • Extra weight causes more stress on hips and knees. • Childhood obesity can cause pain and sometimes injuries in the hips, knees and back. • Breathing conditions. • Asthma is more common in children who are overweight. • These children also are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea. • Obstructive sleep apnea can be a serious condition in which breathing stops and starts many times during sleep. • Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. • This condition causes fatty deposits to build up in the liver. • It usually causes no symptoms. • But it can lead to liver scarring and damage. • The condition used to be known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. • Children who have obesity may get teased or bullied by their peers. • As a result, they may lose self-esteem. • They also can have a higher risk of depression, anxiety and eating disorders.",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent childhood obesity, take the following steps: Set a good example. • Make healthy eating and regular physical activity a family affair. • That way, everyone benefits and no one feels singled out. • It's ideal for your child to get an hour of physical activity a day at least five days a week. • Offer balanced meals and snacks each day. • To serve a balanced meal, think of the space for food on a plate. • Fruits and vegetables should take up half of the plate. • Grains such as bulgur, brown rice and whole-wheat pasta should take up a quarter of the plate. • Proteins such as lean meat, poultry, seafood and lentils should take up the other quarter of the plate. • Between meals, offer snacks that have lots of nutrients and little added sugar, saturated fat and sodium. • Examples of balanced snacks include yogurt with berries, an apple with nut butter, and whole grain crackers with turkey and avocado. • Feel free to get creative when you combine different foods. • Keep offering new foods. • Your child might not like a new food right away. • But if you offer it again, your child may learn to enjoy it over time. • Support a healthy relationship with junk food. • Some foods such as fast food, cookies and chips are tasty, but they don't have much nutrition. • Many junk foods also have high levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugar. • Sweet drinks and fruit juices also tend to have lots of sugar with little to no nutrition. • Explain to your children that they can enjoy these tasty foods on occasion, such as ice cream during a family day out. • But help them understand that junk foods don't give the all-day energy that nutritious foods provide. • Think about keeping junk foods off the grocery list and out of the home. • Doing so could help the family focus on nutritious foods for meals and snacks. • Limit screen time. • Don't let your family watch TV during meals, and have family members put phones and tablets away. • Since your child likely will use screens at other times, think about setting a time limit that everyone in the home follows. • Encourage children to have fun doing things that don't involve a screen. • Choose rewards that aren't food. • Try not to promise your child snacks for good behavior. • Suggest a fun activity reward instead. • Examples include playing a game together or taking a trip to the park or the zoo. • Be sure your child gets enough sleep. • Too little sleep may raise the risk of obesity. • How much sleep children need depends on their age. • For instance, children ages 6 to 12 need about 9 to 12 hours of sleep a day. • Teens ages 13 to 18 need about 8 to 10 hours. • Try to help your child go to sleep and wake up at the same times each day. • Breastfeed your baby. • Breastfeeding your infant from birth to 6 months old may lower the risk of obesity later in life. • Be sure that your child gets well-child checkups at least once a year too. • During this visit, a healthcare professional measures your child's height and weight and figures out your child's BMI. • If your child's BMI rises a lot over one year, your child may be at risk of becoming overweight."

      "Overview": "Childhood schizophrenia is an uncommon but severe mental disorder in which children and teenagers interpret reality abnormally. • Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognitive), behavior or emotions. • It may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs your child's ability to function. • Childhood schizophrenia is essentially the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it starts early in life — generally in the teenage years — and has a profound impact on a child's behavior and development. • With childhood schizophrenia, the early age of onset presents special challenges for diagnosis, treatment, education, and emotional and social development. • Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment. • Identifying and starting treatment for childhood schizophrenia as early as possible may significantly improve your child's long-term outcome.",
      "Symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. • Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. • The effect can be disabling. • In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. • Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. • Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. • Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. • Some symptoms may always be present. • Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. • Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. • Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. • Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. • Signs and symptoms may include: Delusions. • These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. • For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. • Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. • Hallucinations. • These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. • Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. • Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. • Disorganized thinking. • Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. • Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. • Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. • Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. • This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. • Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. • Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. • Negative symptoms. • This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. • For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. • Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure. • Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be: Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. • Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. • Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions. • As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. • Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. • As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication. • It can be difficult to know how to handle vague behavioral changes in your child. • You may be afraid of rushing to conclusions that label your child with a mental illness. • Your child's teacher or other school staff may alert you to changes in your child's behavior. • Seek medical care as soon as possible if you have concerns about your child's behavior or development. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with schizophrenia. • If you have a child or teen who is in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with him or her. • Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Or if you think you can do so safely, take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room.",
      "Causes": "It's not known what causes childhood schizophrenia, but it's thought that it develops in the same way as adult schizophrenia does. • Researchers believe that a combination of genetics, brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder. • It's not clear why schizophrenia starts so early in life for some and not for others. • Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. • Neuroimaging studies show differences in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. • While researchers aren't certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a brain disease.",
      "Risk factors": "Although the precise cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including: Having a family history of schizophrenia Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation Older age of the father Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development Taking mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs during teen years",
      "Complications": "Left untreated, childhood schizophrenia can result in severe emotional, behavioral and health problems. • Complications associated with schizophrenia may occur in childhood or later, such as: Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide Self-injury Anxiety disorders, panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Depression Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine Family conflicts Inability to live independently, attend school or work Social isolation Health and medical problems Being victimized Legal and financial problems, and homelessness Aggressive behavior, although uncommon",
      "Prevention": "Early identification and treatment may help get symptoms of childhood schizophrenia under control before serious complications develop. • Early treatment is also crucial in helping limit psychotic episodes, which can be extremely frightening to a child and his or her parents. • Ongoing treatment can help improve your child's long-term outlook."

      "Overview": "Chlamydia (kluh-MID-e-uh) is a common sexually transmitted disease. • Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids. • Also called STDs, STIs or venereal disease, sexually transmitted infections are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites. • Chlamydia is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (truh-KOH-muh-tis) bacteria and spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex. • You might not know you have chlamydia because many people don't have symptoms, such as genital pain and discharge from the vagina or penis. • Chlamydia trachomatis affects mostly young women, but it can occur in both men and women and in all age groups. • It's not difficult to treat, but if left untreated it can lead to more-serious health problems.",
      "Symptoms": "Early-stage Chlamydia trachomatis infections often cause few symptoms. • Even when symptoms occur, they're often mild. • That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important. • Symptoms of Chlamydia trachomatis infection can include: Painful urination. • Vaginal discharge. • Discharge from the penis. • Painful vaginal sex. • Vaginal bleeding between periods and after sex. • Testicular pain. • Depending on a person's sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum. • Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated. • In the throat, an infection may have no symptoms, or a person may have a sore throat. • An infection in the rectum may have no symptoms or may cause rectal pain, discharge or bleeding. • See your healthcare professional if you have a discharge from your vagina, penis or rectum, or if you have pain during urination. • Also, see your healthcare team if you learn your sexual partner has chlamydia. • Your healthcare professional will likely prescribe an antibiotic even if you have no symptoms. • The Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium is most commonly spread through vaginal, oral and anal sex. • It also is possible for the bacterium to spread in pregnancy, during delivery of the baby. • Chlamydia can cause pneumonia or a serious eye infection in the newborn. • People who have sex before age 25 are at higher risk of chlamydia than are older people. • That's because younger people are more likely to have more than one risk factor. • Risk factors for chlamydia include: Not using a condom or incorrect condom use. • Less use of health services to prevent and treat sexually transmitted infections. • New or multiple sex partners. • Changing sex partners before learning about a chlamydia infection. • Chlamydia trachomatis can be associated with: Pelvic inflammatory disease, also called PID. • PID is an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes. • Severe infections might require care in the hospital. • PID can damage the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus, including the cervix. • Infection near the testicles. • A chlamydia infection can inflame the coiled tube located beside each testicle, called the epididymis. • The infection can result in fever, scrotal pain and swelling. • Prostate gland infection. • Rarely, the chlamydia bacteria can spread to the prostate gland. • Prostatitis can cause pain during or after sex, fever and chills, painful urination, and lower back pain. • Infections in newborns. • The chlamydia infection can pass from the vaginal canal to your child during delivery, causing pneumonia or a serious eye infection. • Ectopic pregnancy. • This occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside of the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. • The egg needs to be removed to prevent life-threatening complications, such as a burst tube. • A chlamydia infection increases this risk. • Infertility. • Chlamydia infections can cause scarring and obstruction in the fallopian tubes, which might lead to infertility. • Reactive arthritis. • People who have Chlamydia trachomatis are at higher risk of developing reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter syndrome. • This condition typically affects the joints, eyes and urethra — the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside of your body. • The surest way to prevent chlamydia infection is to abstain from sexual activities. • Short of that, you can: Use condoms. • Use a male latex condom or a female polyurethane condom during each sexual contact. • Condoms used properly during every sexual encounter lower but don't eliminate the risk of infection. • Limit your number of sex partners. • Having multiple sex partners puts you at a high risk of contracting chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections. • Get regular screenings. • If you're sexually active, particularly if you have multiple partners, talk with your healthcare professional about how often you should be screened for chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections. • A medicine called doxycycline may be an option to prevent infection among people at higher risk than average of getting chlamydia. • Higher risk groups include men who have sex with men and transgender women. • Taking doxycycline within 3 days of sexual activity lowers the risk of an infection with the bacteria that cause chlamydia. • Your healthcare professional can prescribe doxycycline and any testing you need while taking the medicine.",

      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. • Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. • The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. • The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. • In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include: Increasing age. • Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age. • Other bone diseases. • Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body. • These growths sometimes transform into chondrosarcoma."

      "Overview": "Choroid plexus carcinoma is a rare type of brain cancer that happens mainly in children. • Choroid plexus carcinoma begins as a growth of cells in the part of the brain called the choroid plexus. • Cells in the choroid plexus produce the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. • This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF. • As the cancer grows, it can cause too much CSF in the brain. • This can lead to symptoms such as irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headaches. • Treatment and chance of recovery depend on many factors. • These include the cancer's size, location, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health.",
      "Symptoms": "Choroid plexus carcinoma symptoms include: Blurred or double vision. • Headaches. • Increased tiredness. • Irritability. • Nausea. • Seizures. • Vomiting. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if your child has any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes most choroid plexus carcinomas. • This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the brain. • Choroid plexus carcinoma happens when cells in the brain develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase the risk of choroid plexus carcinoma include: Young age. • Choroid plexus carcinoma can happen at any age. • This brain cancer happens most often in children under 2 years old. • Inherited syndromes. • Some choroid plexus carcinomas are linked to certain genetic changes that can run in families, such as with Li-Fraumeni syndrome."

      "Overview": "A chronic cough is a cough that lasts eight weeks or longer in adults, or four weeks in children. • A chronic cough is more than just annoying. • It can interrupt your sleep and leave you feeling very tired. • Severe cases of chronic cough can cause vomiting and lightheadedness, and even break a rib. • The most common causes are tobacco use and asthma. • Other common causes include fluid that drips from the nose down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip, and the backward flow of stomach acid into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach, called acid reflux. • Fortunately, chronic cough usually goes away once the underlying issue is treated.",
      "Symptoms": "A chronic cough can occur with other symptoms, including: A runny or stuffy nose. • A feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat, also known as postnasal drip. • Clearing your throat a lot. • Sore throat. • Hoarseness. • Wheezing and shortness of breath. • Heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. • In rare cases, coughing up blood. • See your healthcare professional if you have a cough that lasts for weeks, especially one that brings up sputum or blood, disturbs your sleep, or affects school or work. • A cough that happens once in a while is common. • It helps clear irritants and mucus from your lungs and prevents infection. • But a cough that lasts for weeks is usually due to a health concern. • Many times, more than one health concern causes the cough. • Most cases of chronic cough are due to these causes, which can occur alone or together: Postnasal drip. • When your nose or sinuses produce extra mucus, it can drip down the back of your throat and cause you to cough. • This condition also is called upper airway cough syndrome. • Asthma. • An asthma-related cough may come and go with the seasons. • It may appear after an upper respiratory tract infection. • Or it can get worse when you're exposed to cold air or certain chemicals or fragrances. • In one type of asthma known as cough-variant asthma, a cough is the main symptom. • Gastroesophageal reflux disease. • In this common condition, also called GERD, stomach acid flows back into the tube that connects your stomach and throat. • This tube is also known as your esophagus. • The constant irritation can lead to chronic coughing. • Then the coughing can make GERD worse, creating a vicious cycle. • Infections. • A cough can last long after other symptoms of pneumonia, flu, a cold or another infection of the upper respiratory tract have gone away. • A common cause of a chronic cough in adults — but one that often isn't recognized — is whooping cough, also known as pertussis. • Chronic cough also can occur with fungal infections of the lung, as well as tuberculosis infection, also called TB, or lung infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria, also called NTM. • NTM is found in soil, water and dust. • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). • Also called COPD, this is a lifelong inflammatory lung disease that limits airflow from the lungs. • COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. • Chronic bronchitis can cause a cough that brings up colored sputum. • Emphysema causes shortness of breath and damages the air sacs in the lungs, also known as alveoli. • Most people with COPD are current or former smokers. • Blood pressure drugs. • Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, also called ACE inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure, are known to cause chronic cough in some people. • Less commonly, chronic cough may be caused by: Aspiration — when food or other items are swallowed or inhaled and go into the lungs. • Bronchiectasis — widened and damaged airways that slowly lose the ability to clear out mucus. • Bronchiolitis — an infection that causes swelling, irritation and buildup of mucus in the small airways of the lung. • Cystic fibrosis — a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system and other organs. • Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis — gradual damage and scarring of the lungs due to a cause that isn't known. • Lung cancer — cancer that starts in the lungs, including non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. • Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis — when airways are inflamed but asthma is not the cause. • Sarcoidosis — groups of inflamed cells that form lumps or nodules in different parts of the body but most often in the lungs. • Being a current or former smoker is one of the leading risk factors for chronic cough. • Exposure to a lot of secondhand smoke also can lead to coughing and lung damage. • Having a cough that doesn't stop can be very tiring. • Coughing can cause various concerns, including: Sleep disruption. • Headache. • Dizziness. • Vomiting. • Sweating a lot. • Unintended bladder loss, also known as urinary incontinence. • Broken ribs. • Passing out, also known as syncope.",

      "Overview": "Most people have headaches from time to time. • But if you have a headache more days than not, you might have chronic daily headaches. • Rather than a specific headache type, chronic daily headaches include a variety of headache subtypes. • Chronic refers to how often the headaches occur and how long the condition lasts. • The constant nature of chronic daily headaches makes them one of the most disabling headache conditions. • Aggressive initial treatment and steady, long-term management might reduce pain and lead to fewer headaches.",
      "Symptoms": "By definition, chronic daily headaches occur 15 days or more a month, for longer than three months. • True (primary) chronic daily headaches aren't caused by another condition. • There are short-lasting and long-lasting chronic daily headaches. • Long-lasting headaches last more than four hours. • They include: Chronic migraine Chronic tension-type headache New daily persistent headache Hemicrania continua This type typically occurs in people with a history of episodic migraines. • Chronic migraines tend to: Affect one side or both sides of your head Have a pulsating, throbbing sensation Cause moderate to severe pain And they cause at least one of the following: Nausea, vomiting or both Sensitivity to light and sound These headaches tend to: Affect both sides of your head Cause mild to moderate pain Cause pain that feels pressing or tightening, but not pulsating These headaches come on suddenly, usually in people without a headache history. • They become constant within three days of your first headache. • They: Often affect both sides of your head Cause pain that feels like pressing or tightening, but not pulsating Cause mild to moderate pain Might have features of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache These headaches: Affect only one side of your head Are daily and continuous with no pain-free periods Cause moderate pain with spikes of severe pain Respond to the prescription pain reliever indomethacin (Indocin) Can become severe with development of migraine-like symptoms In addition, hemicrania continua headaches are associated with at least one of the following: Tearing or redness of the eye on the affected side Nasal congestion or runny nose Drooping eyelid or pupil narrowing Sensation of restlessness Occasional headaches are common, and usually require no medical attention. • However, consult your doctor if: You usually have two or more headaches a week You take a pain reliever for your headaches most days You need more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter pain remedies to relieve your headaches Your headache pattern changes or your headaches worsen Your headaches are disabling Seek prompt medical care if your headache: Is sudden and severe Accompanies a fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness or difficulty speaking Follows a head injury Gets worse despite rest and pain medication The causes of many chronic daily headaches aren't well-understood. • True (primary) chronic daily headaches don't have an identifiable underlying cause. • Conditions that might cause nonprimary chronic daily headaches include: Inflammation or other problems with the blood vessels in and around the brain, including stroke Infections, such as meningitis Intracranial pressure that's either too high or too low Brain tumor Traumatic brain injury This type of headache usually develops in people who have an episodic headache disorder, usually migraine or tension type, and take too much pain medication. • If you're taking pain medications — even over-the-counter — more than two days a week (or nine days a month), you're at risk of developing rebound headaches. • Factors associated with developing frequent headaches include: Female sex Anxiety Depression Sleep disturbances Obesity Snoring Overuse of caffeine Overuse of headache medication Other chronic pain conditions If you have chronic daily headaches, you're also more likely to have depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and other psychological and physical problems. • Taking care of yourself might help ease chronic daily headaches. • Avoid headache triggers. • Keeping a headache diary can help you determine what triggers your headaches so that you can avoid the triggers. • Include details about every headache, such as when it started, what you were doing at the time and how long it lasted. • Avoid medication overuse. • Taking headache medications, including over-the-counter medications, more than twice a week can increase the severity and frequency of your headaches. • Consult your doctor about how to wean yourself off the medication because there can be serious side effects if done improperly. • Get enough sleep. • The average adult needs seven to eight hours of sleep a night. • It's best to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. • Talk to your doctor if you have sleep disturbances, such as snoring. • Don't skip meals. • Eat healthy meals at about the same times daily. • Avoid food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches. • Lose weight if you're obese. • Exercise regularly. • Regular aerobic physical activity can improve your physical and mental well-being and reduce stress. • With your doctor's OK, choose activities you enjoy — such as walking, swimming or cycling. • To avoid injury, start slowly. • Reduce stress. • Stress is a common trigger of chronic headaches. • Get organized. • Simplify your schedule. • Plan ahead. • Stay positive. • Try stress-reduction techniques, such as yoga, tai chi or meditation. • Reduce caffeine. • While some headache medications include caffeine because it can be beneficial in reducing headache pain, it can also aggravate headaches. • Try to minimize or eliminate caffeine from your diet.",

      "Symptoms": "People with chronic granulomatous disease experience serious bacterial or fungal infection every few years. • An infection in the lungs, including pneumonia, is common. • People with CGD may develop a serious type of fungal pneumonia after being exposed to dead leaves, mulch or hay. • It's also common for people with CGD to experience infections of the skin, liver, stomach and intestines, brain, and eyes. • Symptoms associated with infections include: Fever. • Chest pain when inhaling or exhaling. • Swollen and sore lymph glands. • An ongoing runny nose. • Skin irritation that may include a rash, swelling or redness. • Swelling and redness in the mouth. • Gastrointestinal problems that may include: Vomiting. • Diarrhea. • Stomach pain. • Bloody stool. • A painful pocket of pus near the anus. • If you think you or your child has a type of fungal pneumonia from being around dead leaves, mulch or hay, get medical care right away. • If you or your child has frequent infections and the symptoms listed above, talk to your health care provider.",
      "Causes": "A change in one of five genes can cause CGD. • People with CGD inherit the changed gene from a parent. • These genes produce proteins that form an enzyme. • This enzyme helps your immune system work properly. • The enzyme is active in white blood cells, called phagocytes, that protect you from infections by destroying fungi and bacteria. • The enzyme is also active in immune cells that help your body heal. • When there are changes to one of these genes, the protective proteins are not produced. • Or they're produced, but they don't function properly. • Some people with CGD don't have one of these changed genes. • In these cases, health care providers don't know what causes the condition.",

      "Overview": "Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. • Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. • Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body. • In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. • You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced. • Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. • But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. • Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. • Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. • Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause: Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Fatigue and weakness Sleep problems Urinating more or less Decreased mental sharpness Muscle cramps Swelling of feet and ankles Dry, itchy skin High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific. • This means they can also be caused by other illnesses. • Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred. • Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. • Early detection might help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure. • If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor may monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during office visits. • Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. • Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. • Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: Type 1 or type 2 diabetes High blood pressure Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli) Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures Polycystic kidney disease or other inherited kidney diseases Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: Diabetes High blood pressure Heart (cardiovascular) disease Smoking Obesity Being Black, Native American or Asian American Family history of kidney disease Abnormal kidney structure Older age Frequent use of medications that can damage the kidneys Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. • Potential complications include: Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's function and can be life-threatening Anemia Heart disease Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease: Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. • When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package. • Taking too many pain relievers for a long time could lead to kidney damage. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If you're at a healthy weight, maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. • If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. • Don't smoke. • Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. • If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting. • Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop. • Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. • If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. • Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.",

      "Complications": "Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. • Potential complications include: Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema) A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's function and can be life-threatening Anemia Heart disease Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium) Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival",
      "Prevention": "To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease: Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. • When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package. • Taking too many pain relievers for a long time could lead to kidney damage. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If you're at a healthy weight, maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. • If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. • Don't smoke. • Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. • If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting. • Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop. • Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. • If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. • Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage."

      "Overview": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. • The term \"chronic\" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that this leukemia typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. • The term \"lymphocytic\" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease — a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection. • Chronic lymphocytic leukemia most commonly affects older adults. • There are treatments to help control the disease.",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first. • Signs and symptoms might develop as the cancer progresses. • They might include: Enlarged, but painless, lymph nodes Fatigue Fever Pain in the upper left portion of the abdomen, which may be caused by an enlarged spleen Night sweats Weight loss Frequent infections Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Doctors aren't certain what starts the process that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. • What's known is that something happens to cause changes (mutations) in the DNA of blood-producing cells. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the blood cells to produce abnormal, ineffective lymphocytes. • Beyond being ineffective, these abnormal lymphocytes continue to live and multiply when healthy lymphocytes would die. • The abnormal lymphocytes accumulate in the blood and certain organs, where they cause complications. • They may crowd healthy cells out of the bone marrow and interfere with blood cell production. • Doctors and researchers are working to understand the exact mechanism that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include: Your age. • This disease occurs most often in older adults. • Your race. • White people are more likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia than are people of other races. • Family history of blood and bone marrow cancers. • A family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other blood and bone marrow cancers may increase your risk. • Exposure to chemicals. • Certain herbicides and insecticides, including Agent Orange used during the Vietnam War, have been linked to an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. • A condition that causes excess lymphocytes. • Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) causes an increased number of one type of lymphocyte (B cells) in the blood. • For a small number of people with MBL, the condition may develop into chronic lymphocytic leukemia. • If you have MBL and also have a family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, you may have a higher risk of developing cancer.",
      "Complications": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia may cause complications such as: Frequent infections. • If you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia, you may experience frequent infections that can be serious. • Sometimes infections happen because your blood doesn't have enough germ-fighting antibodies (immunoglobulins). • Your doctor might recommend regular immunoglobulin infusions. • A switch to a more aggressive form of cancer. • A small number of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia may develop a more aggressive form of cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. • Doctors sometimes refer to this as Richter's syndrome. • Increased risk of other cancers. • People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have an increased risk of other types of cancer, including skin cancer and cancers of the lung and the digestive tract. • Immune system problems. • A small number of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia may develop an immune system problem that causes the disease-fighting cells of the immune system to mistakenly attack the red blood cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or the platelets (autoimmune thrombocytopenia)."

      "Overview": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia, also called CML, is an uncommon type of cancer of the bone marrow. • Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. • CML causes an increased number of white blood cells in the blood. • The term \"chronic\" in chronic myelogenous leukemia means this cancer tends to progress more slowly than severe forms of leukemia. • The term \"myelogenous\" (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) refers to the type of cells affected by this cancer. • Chronic myelogenous leukemia also can be called chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic granulocytic leukemia. • It typically affects older adults and rarely occurs in children, though it can occur at any age. • Advances in treatment have improved the prognosis of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. • Most people can achieve remission and live for many years after diagnosis.",
      "Symptoms": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia often doesn't cause symptoms. • It might be detected during a blood test. • When they occur, symptoms may include: Bone pain. • Bleeding easily. • Feeling full after eating a small amount of food. • Fatigue. • Fever. • Weight loss without trying. • Loss of appetite. • Pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side. • Excessive sweating during sleep. • Blurry vision caused by bleeding in the back of the eye. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have any persistent symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia happens when something causes changes to the bone marrow cells. • It's not clear what starts this process. • However, doctors have discovered how it progresses into chronic myelogenous leukemia. • Human cells typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes. • These chromosomes hold the DNA that contains the instructions that tell the cells what to do. • In people with chronic myelogenous leukemia, the chromosomes in the blood cells swap sections with each other. • A section of chromosome 9 switches places with a section of chromosome 22. • This creates an extra-short chromosome 22 and an extra-long chromosome 9. • The extra-short chromosome 22 is called the Philadelphia chromosome. • It is named for the city where it was discovered. • The Philadelphia chromosome is present in the blood cells of 90% of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. • Genes from chromosome 9 combine with genes from chromosome 22 to create a new gene called BCR-ABL. • The BCR-ABL gene tells the blood cells to produce too much of a protein called tyrosine kinase. • Tyrosine kinase promotes cancer by allowing certain blood cells to grow out of control. • Blood cells begin growing in the bone marrow. • When the bone marrow functions correctly, it produces immature cells, called blood stem cells, in a controlled way. • These cells then mature and specialize into the red cells, white cells and platelets that circulate in the blood. • In chronic myelogenous leukemia, this process doesn't work properly. • The tyrosine kinase allows too many white blood cells to grow. • Most or all of these cells contain the Philadelphia chromosome. • The diseased white blood cells don't grow and die like they should. • The diseased white blood cells build up in huge numbers. • They crowd out healthy blood cells and damage the bone marrow.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase the risk of chronic myelogenous leukemia include: Older age. • CML is more common in older people than in children and teens. • Being male. • Men are slightly more at risk of developing CML than are women. • Radiation exposure. • Radiation therapy for certain types of cancer has been linked to CML. • There's no way to prevent chronic myelogenous leukemia. • If you get it, there's nothing you could have done to prevent it. • The gene change that leads to chronic myelogenous leukemia isn't passed from parents to children. • This change is believed to develop after birth."

      "Overview": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain disorder likely caused by repeated head injuries. • It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration. • CTE gets worse over time. • The only way to definitively diagnosis CTE is after death during an autopsy of the brain. • CTE is a rare disorder that is not yet well understood. • CTE doesn't appear to be related to a single head injury. • It's related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat. • The development of CTE has been associated with second impact syndrome, in which a second head injury happens before previous head injury symptoms have fully resolved. • Experts are still trying to understand how repeated head injuries and other factors might contribute to the changes in the brain that result in CTE. • Researchers are looking into how the number of head injuries someone experiences and how bad the injuries are may affect risk of CTE. • CTE has been found in the brains of people who played U.S. football and other contact sports, including boxing. • It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts. • Symptoms of CTE are thought to include trouble with thinking and emotions, physical problems, and other behaviors. • It's thought that these develop years to decades after head trauma occurs. • CTE can't be definitively diagnosed during life except in people with high-risk exposures. • Researchers are currently developing diagnostic biomarkers for CTE, but none has been validated yet. • When the symptoms associated with CTE occur, health care providers may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. • Experts don't yet know how often CTE occurs in the population, but it appears to be rare. • They also don't fully understand the causes. • There is no cure for CTE.",
      "Symptoms": "There are no specific symptoms that have been clearly linked to CTE. • Some of the possible symptoms can occur in many other conditions. • In the people who were confirmed to have CTE at autopsy, symptoms have included cognitive, behavioral, mood and motor changes. • Trouble thinking. • Memory loss. • Problems with planning, organization and carrying out tasks. • Impulsive behavior. • Aggression. • Depression or apathy. • Emotional instability. • Substance misuse. • Suicidal thoughts or behavior. • Problems with walking and balance. • Parkinsonism, which causes shaking, slow movement and trouble with speech. • Motor neuron disease, which destroys cells that control walking, speaking, swallowing and breathing. • CTE symptoms don't develop right after a head injury. • Experts believe that they develop over years or decades after repeated head trauma. • Experts also believe that CTE symptoms appear in two forms. • In early life between the late 20s and early 30s, the first form of CTE may cause mental health and behavioral issues. • Symptoms of this form include depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and aggression. • The second form of CTE is thought to cause symptoms later in life, around age 60. • These symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia. • The full list of signs to look for in people with CTE at autopsy is still unknown. • There's also little known about how CTE progresses. • CTE is thought to develop over many years after repeated brain injuries that may be mild or severe. • See your health care provider in these situations: Suicidal thoughts. • Research shows that people with CTE may be at increased risk of suicide. • If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number. • Or contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or use the Lifeline Chat. • Head injury. • See your health care provider if you've had a head injury, even if you didn't need emergency care. • If your child has received a head injury that concerns you, call your child's health care provider right away. • Depending on the symptoms, your or your child's provider may recommend seeking immediate medical care. • Memory problems. • See your health care provider if you have concerns about your memory. • Also see your provider if you experience other thinking or behavior problems. • Personality or mood changes. • See your health care provider if you experience depression, anxiety, aggression or impulsive behavior.",
      "Causes": "Repeated head trauma is likely the cause of CTE. • Football players in the United States, ice hockey players and military members serving in war zones have been the focus of most CTE studies. • However, other sports and factors such as physical abuse also can lead to repeated head injuries. • A head injury can cause a concussion, which may cause headaches, problems with memory and other symptoms. • Not everyone who experiences repeated concussions, including athletes and military members, go on to develop CTE. • Some studies have shown no increased incidence of CTE in people exposed to repeated head injuries. • In brains with CTE, researchers have found that there is a buildup of a protein called tau around the blood vessels. • Tau buildup in CTE is different from accumulations of tau found in Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. • CTE is thought to cause areas of the brain to waste away, known as atrophy. • This happens because injuries to nerve cells that conduct electrical impulses affect communication between cells. • It's possible that people with CTE may show signs of another neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, also known as frontotemporal dementia.",
      "Risk factors": "Repeated exposure to traumatic brain injury is thought to increase the risk of CTE. • Experts are still learning about the risk factors.",
      "Prevention": "There is no treatment for CTE. • But CTE may be prevented because it's associated with recurrent concussions. • People who have had one concussion are more likely to have another head injury. • The current recommendation to prevent CTE is to reduce mild traumatic brain injuries and to prevent additional injury after a concussion."

      "Symptoms": "Cirrhosis often has no symptoms until liver damage is serious. • When symptoms do happen, they may include: Extreme tiredness. • Easily bleeding or bruising. • Loss of appetite. • Nausea. • Swelling in the legs, feet or ankles, called edema. • Weight loss. • Itchy skin. • Yellow discoloration in the skin and eyes, called jaundice. • Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez). • Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin. • Redness in the palms of the hands. • Pale fingernails, especially the thumb and index finger. • Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual. • For women, absence of or loss of periods not related to menopause. • For men, loss of sex drive, testicular shrinkage or breast enlargement, known as gynecomastia. • Confusion, drowsiness or slurred speech. • Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have any of the symptoms listed above. • A wide range of diseases and conditions can damage the liver and lead to cirrhosis. • Some of the causes include: Long-term alcohol abuse. • Ongoing viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C and D). • Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease — formerly called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — a condition in which fat builds up in the liver. • Hemochromatosis, a condition that causes iron buildup in the body. • Autoimmune hepatitis, which is a liver disease caused by the body's immune system. • Destruction of the bile ducts caused by primary biliary cholangitis. • Hardening and scarring of the bile ducts caused by primary sclerosing cholangitis. • Wilson's disease, a condition in which copper build up in the liver. • Cystic fibrosis. • Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. • Poorly formed bile ducts, a condition known as biliary atresia. • Disorders of sugar metabolism, such as galactosemia or glycogen storage disease. • Alagille syndrome, a genetic digestive disorder. • Infection, such as syphilis or brucellosis. • Medicines, including methotrexate or isoniazid. • Drinking too much alcohol. • Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for cirrhosis. • Being overweight. • Being obese increases the risk of conditions that may lead to cirrhosis. • These conditions include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, formerly called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. • Having viral hepatitis. • Not everyone with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis, but it's one of the world's leading causes of liver disease. • Complications of cirrhosis can include: High blood pressure in the veins that supply the liver. • This condition is known as portal hypertension. • Cirrhosis slows the regular flow of blood through the liver. • This increases pressure in the vein that brings blood to the liver. • Swelling in the legs and belly. • The increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to build up in the legs, called edema, and in the belly, called ascites. • Edema and ascites also may happen if the liver can't make enough of certain blood proteins, such as albumin. • Swelling of the spleen. • Portal hypertension can cause the spleen to trap white blood cells and platelets. • This makes the spleen swell, a condition known as splenomegaly. • Fewer white blood cells and platelets in your blood can be the first sign of cirrhosis. • Bleeding. • Portal hypertension can cause blood to be redirected to smaller veins. • Strained by the extra pressure, these smaller veins can burst, causing serious bleeding. • Portal hypertension also may cause enlarged veins, called varices (VAIR-uh-seez), in the esophagus or the stomach. • These varices also may lead to life-threatening bleeding. • If the liver can't make enough clotting factors, this also can contribute to continued bleeding. • Infections. • Having cirrhosis makes it hard for the body to fight infections. • Ascites also can lead to bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection. • Malnutrition. • Cirrhosis may make it more difficult for the body to process nutrients, leading to weakness and weight loss. • Buildup of toxins in the brain. • A liver damaged by cirrhosis can't clear toxins from the blood as well as a healthy liver can. • These toxins can then build up in the brain and cause mental confusion and difficulty concentrating. • This is known as hepatic encephalopathy. • With time, hepatic encephalopathy can progress to unresponsiveness or coma. • Jaundice. • Jaundice happens when the diseased liver doesn't remove enough bilirubin, a blood waste product, from the blood. • Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes and darkening of urine. • Bone disease. • Some people with cirrhosis lose bone strength and are at greater risk of fractures. • Increased risk of liver cancer. • A large proportion of people who develop liver cancer have pre-existing cirrhosis. • Acute-on-chronic cirrhosis. • Some people end up experiencing multiorgan failure. • Researchers now believe this is a complication in some people who have cirrhosis. • However, they don't fully understand what causes it. • Lower the risk of cirrhosis by taking these steps to care for your liver: Do not drink alcohol if you have cirrhosis. • If you have liver disease, you should not drink alcohol. • Eat a healthy diet. • Choose a diet that's full of fruits and vegetables. • Select whole grains and lean sources of protein. • Cut down on the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Too much body fat can damage the liver. • Talk to a healthcare professional about a weight-loss plan if you are obese or overweight. • Reduce your risk of hepatitis. • Sharing needles and having unprotected sex can increase the risk of hepatitis B and C. • Ask a care professional about hepatitis vaccinations. • If you're concerned about your risk of liver cirrhosis, talk to a health professional about ways to reduce your risk.",

      "Overview": "Cleft lip and cleft palate are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth (palate) or both. • Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when an unborn baby's face and mouth are developing and the upper lip and palate don't close fully. • Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common birth defects. • These birth defects can occur on their own or together. • Sometimes a syndrome may cause these birth defects. • But the cause is often not known. • Having a baby born with a cleft can be upsetting, but treatment can correct cleft lip and cleft palate. • After a series of surgeries, the lips and palate work like they should and the baby looks much better. • Usually, only slight scarring occurs.",
      "Symptoms": "Usually, a split (cleft) in the lip or roof of the mouth (palate) can be seen right away at birth. • It may be found before birth during a prenatal ultrasound. • Cleft lip and cleft palate may look like: A split in the lip and palate that affects one or both sides of the face. • A split in the lip that appears as only a small notch in the lip or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate into the bottom of the nose. • A split in the roof of the mouth that doesn't affect how the face looks. • Less often, a cleft occurs only in the muscles of the soft palate, which are at the back of the mouth and covered by the mouth's lining. • This is called a submucous cleft palate. • This type of cleft may not be seen at birth and may not be diagnosed until later when signs arise, such as: Having a hard time feeding. • Nasal speaking voice. • Constant ear infections. • Rarely, having a hard time swallowing. • Liquids or foods may come out of the nose. • A cleft lip and cleft palate may be seen at birth or may be found on ultrasound before birth. • Your healthcare professional can start coordinating care at that time. • If your baby has symptoms of a submucous cleft palate, make an appointment with your child's healthcare professional.",
      "Causes": "Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when tissues in the baby's face and mouth don't come together properly before birth. • Usually, the tissues that make up the lip and palate come together in the first few weeks of pregnancy. • But in babies with cleft lip and cleft palate, they never come together or only come together partway, leaving an opening. • Both genes and the environment may cause cases of cleft lip and cleft palate. • But in many babies, the cause is not known. • The mother or the father can pass on genes that cause clefting, either alone or as part of a genetic syndrome that includes a cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs. • In some cases, babies inherit a gene that makes them more likely to get a cleft, and the mix with environmental factors causes the cleft to occur.",
      "Risk factors": "Several factors may make it more likely that a baby gets a cleft lip and cleft palate, including: Family history. • Parents with a family history of cleft lip or cleft palate may be at more risk of having a baby with a cleft. • Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy. • Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who use tobacco, drink alcohol or take certain medicines. • Not getting certain vitamins during pregnancy. • For example, not having enough folate in the body during the first trimester of pregnancy may raise the risk of cleft lip and cleft palate. • Males are more likely to have a cleft lip with or without cleft palate. • Cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in females. • In the U.S., cleft lip and cleft palate are most common in people of Native American or Asian heritage and least common in African American heritage.",
      "Complications": "Children with cleft lip with or without cleft palate face various challenges, depending on the type and severity of the cleft, including: Having a hard time feeding. • One concern right away after birth is feeding. • While most babies with cleft lip can breastfeed, a cleft palate may make it hard to suck. • Ear infections and hearing loss. • Babies with cleft palate are especially at risk of developing middle ear fluid and losing hearing. • Dental problems. • If the cleft extends through the upper gum, teeth may not develop properly. • Having a hard time with speech. • Because babies use the palate to form sounds, a cleft palate can affect the usual development of speech. • Also, speech may have a nasal sound. • Challenges of coping with a medical condition. • Children with clefts may face social, emotional and behavioral problems due to differences in how they look and the stress of medical care.",
      "Prevention": "After a baby is born with a cleft, parents could be concerned about whether they'll have another child with the same condition. • While many cases of cleft lip and cleft palate can't be prevented, think about these steps to lower your risk: Consider genetic counseling. • If you have a family history of cleft lip and cleft palate, tell your healthcare professional before you become pregnant. • Your healthcare professional may refer you to a genetic counselor who can help figure out your risk of having children with cleft lip and cleft palate. • Take prenatal vitamins. • If you're planning to get pregnant soon, ask your healthcare professional if you should take prenatal vitamins. • These contain important vitamins and minerals that you and your unborn baby need. • Don't use tobacco or alcohol. • Use of alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy raises the risk of having a baby with health problems at birth."

      "Overview": "Clubfoot describes a condition present at birth in which a baby's foot is pointed in and down. • The tissues connecting the muscles to the bone are called tendons. • In clubfoot, the tendons are shorter than usual, pulling the foot out of position. • Also called congenital talipes equinovarus (TAL-ih-peez e-kwie-no-VAY-rus), clubfoot is a common foot condition. • It can occur in up to 1 in 1,000 babies. • Most newborns with clubfoot do not have other medical conditions. • Clubfoot can be mild to severe. • About half of children with clubfoot have it in both feet. • If a child has clubfoot that is not treated, the child may walk on the side or top of the foot. • This can cause a limp, skin sores or calluses, and problems wearing shoes. • Clubfoot will not get better without treatment. • But it can be successfully treated using a specific casting technique. • Usually, babies also need a minor procedure to lengthen the heel tendon. • Treatment results are best with casting that begins within several weeks after birth.",
      "Symptoms": "If your child has clubfoot, here's what it might look like: The top of the foot is usually pointed in and down. • This raises the arch and turns the heel inward. • The foot may be turned so severely that it looks like it is upside down. • The foot or big toe may be slightly shorter than the other foot. • The calf muscles in the leg with clubfoot are usually smaller. • At birth, clubfoot doesn't cause any discomfort or pain. • Your healthcare professional is likely to notice clubfoot during an exam soon after your child is born. • You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in bone and muscle conditions in children called a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.",
      "Causes": "The cause of clubfoot is not known, but it may be due to genetics and environmental factors.",
      "Risk factors": "Boys are about twice as likely as girls to have clubfoot. • Risk factors include: Family history. • If a child has a parent, brother or sister with clubfoot, that child is more likely to have it too. • Part of other conditions. • Sometimes clubfoot may happen with other skeletal conditions that are present at birth. • One example is spina bifida, a condition that happens when the spine and spinal cord don't develop or close properly before birth. • Certain conditions related to changes in chromosomes also may raise the risk of clubfoot. • Environment. • Smoking during pregnancy can raise the baby's risk of clubfoot. • Not enough amniotic fluid during pregnancy. • Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds the baby in the womb. • Not having enough amniotic fluid may raise the risk of clubfoot.",
      "Complications": "Clubfoot usually doesn't cause any problems until a child starts to stand and walk. • Treatment can bring the foot into the proper position and help a child walk well. • But a child may still have some problems with: Movement. • The foot may be a little stiff and not bend easily. • Leg length. • The leg with clubfoot may be slightly shorter, but this usually doesn't stop a child from learning to walk. • Shoe size. • The foot may be up to 1 1/2 shoe sizes smaller than the other foot. • Calf size. • The muscles of the calf on the side with clubfoot may always be smaller than those on the other side. • Foot shape. • It's common for the foot to have a bean shape and a small inward point, even after treatment. • If clubfoot is not treated, more-serious problems can happen. • These can include: Problems walking. • When clubfoot is not treated, children with the condition can walk but may put their weight on the side of the foot or the top of the foot. • This can cause sores or calluses, problems finding shoes, and a limp. • Problems with late treatment. • Delayed treatment of clubfoot can result in needing more casts and even surgery to correct the foot. • Results are better with early treatment before the bones of the foot become misshapen from the poor foot position. • Arthritis. • There may be swelling and tenderness in one or more joints. • Poor self-image. • The unusual look of the foot may make body image a concern during the teen years.",
      "Prevention": "Because healthcare professionals don't know what causes clubfoot, there's no sure way to prevent it. • But if you're pregnant, you can do things to have a healthy pregnancy and lower your baby's risk of problems that affect the baby's development: Don't smoke or spend time in places with secondhand smoke. • Don't drink alcohol. • Don't use legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets or take medicines that aren't approved by your healthcare professional."

      "Overview": "Cluster headache is a very painful type of headache. • It usually occurs in periods of frequent attacks known as clusters. • Cluster headaches can wake people from sleep. • These headaches cause intense pain in or around one eye on one side of the head. • Cluster periods can last from weeks to months. • Then usually the headaches stop for a period of time, which may last for months or years. • Cluster headache is rare. • Treatments can shorten cluster headache attacks and lessen the pain. • Also, medicines can reduce the number of cluster headaches.",
      "Symptoms": "A cluster headache strikes quickly. • There's usually no warning. • But some people might first have migraine-like nausea and aura. • Common symptoms during a cluster headache include: Extreme sharp or stabbing pain, usually in, behind or around one eye. • The pain can spread to other areas of the face, head and neck. • Pain on one side of the head in a single cluster. • Pain can switch to the other side in another cluster. • Restlessness. • A lot of tears. • Redness of the eye on the side that hurts. • Stuffy or runny nose on the side that hurts. • Forehead or facial sweating. • Skin color changes on the side of the face that hurts. • Swelling around the eye on the side that hurts. • Drooping eyelid on the side that hurts. • Because the pain of a cluster headache can be so bad, those who have one are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. • A cluster period usually lasts for several weeks to months. • Each cluster period may start at about the same time of year and last about the same length of time. • For example, cluster periods can come during certain seasons, such as every spring or every fall. • For most people with cluster headaches, the cluster period lasts from one week to a year. • Then there's a pain-free period, known as remission, for three months or longer before the next cluster headache comes. • This is known as episodic cluster headache. • Cluster periods might go on for more than a year. • Pain-free periods might last less than one month. • If a cluster period lasts a year without letup, it's called chronic cluster headache. • During a cluster period: Headaches usually come every day, often several times a day. • A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours, but more often lasts 30 to 45 minutes. • The attacks often occur at the same time each day. • Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after bedtime. • The pain usually ends as suddenly as it begins. • After attacks, most people are pain-free but exhausted. • See a health care provider if you've just started to have cluster headaches. • Your provider can rule out other illnesses and suggest treatment. • Even bad headache pain isn't usually the result of another disease. • But headaches can sometimes mean a serious medical condition. • This can include a brain tumor or tear of a weakened blood vessel, known as a dissection. • Also, if you have a history of headaches, see your health care provider if there's a change in how they feel or how often they occur. • Seek emergency care if you have any of these symptoms: A severe headache that comes on all of a sudden, often like a clap of thunder. • A headache with a fever, nausea or vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, numbness, or trouble speaking. • These might point to a stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, a brain tumor or other problems. • A headache after a head injury, especially if it gets worse — even if the injury was a minor fall or bump. • A sudden, severe headache unlike any other. • A headache that worsens over days and changes in pattern. • Experts don't know what causes cluster headache. • Cluster headache patterns suggest a link to the area of the brain that helps run the body's biological clock, known as the hypothalamus. • There are several cluster headache triggers. • The most common is drinking alcohol. • Other triggers might include weather changes and certain medicines. • Risk factors for cluster headache include: Sex. • Men are more likely to have cluster headaches than women are. • Age. • Most people who develop cluster headaches are between ages 20 and 50. • But the condition can start at any age. • Smoking. • Many people who get cluster headaches are smokers. • But quitting smoking usually doesn't stop the headaches. • Alcohol use. • If you have cluster headaches, drinking alcohol during a cluster period may increase the risk of an attack. • Family history. • Having a parent, brother or sister who has cluster headache might increase the risk.",

      "Overview": "Aortic coarctation (ko-ahrk-TAY-shun) is a narrowing of a part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The condition forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. • Coarctation of the aorta is usually present at birth. • That means it is a congenital heart defect. • But sometimes the condition can occur later in life. • Coarctation of the aorta often occurs along with other congenital heart defects. • Treatment to fix the condition is usually successful. • But regular health checkups are needed for life to watch for changes in the heart's health.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta depend on how much of the aorta is narrowed. • Most people don't have symptoms. • Adults and older children with mild coarctation of the aorta may not have symptoms and their hearts may seem healthy. • If a baby is born with an extreme narrowing of the aorta, symptoms may be noticed shortly after birth. • Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta in infants include: Difficulty breathing. • Difficulty feeding. • Heavy sweating. • Irritability. • Changes in skin color. • Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta later in life may include: Chest pain. • High blood pressure. • Headaches. • Muscle weakness. • Leg cramps. • Cold feet. • Nosebleeds. • Coarctation of the aorta often occurs with other heart conditions present at birth. • Other symptoms depend on the specific types of congenital heart defects. • Get medical help right away for any chest pain that is extreme or can't be explained. • Also get medical help for these symptoms: Fainting. • Sudden shortness of breath. • High blood pressure that can't be explained. • These symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions. • A complete health checkup is needed to learn the cause.",
      "Causes": "The cause of coarctation of the aorta is unclear. • It's usually a heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • A congenital heart defect happens as the baby is growing in the womb during pregnancy. • The cause is often unknown. • Rarely, coarctation of the aorta can happen later in life. • Conditions or events that can narrow the aorta and cause this condition include: Traumatic injury. • An extreme buildup of cholesterols and fats in the arteries, called atherosclerosis. • A rare type of swelling and irritation of blood vessels in the heart, called Takayasu arteritis.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta include: Male sex. • Some genetic conditions, such as Turner syndrome. • Some heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects. • Congenital heart defects associated with coarctation of the aorta include: Bicuspid aortic valve. • The aortic valve is between the body's main artery and the lower left heart chamber. • If the aortic valve has only two flaps, called cusps, instead of the usual three, it's called a bicuspid valve. • Subaortic stenosis. • This is a narrowing of the area below the aortic valve. • It blocks blood flow from the lower left heart chamber to the aorta. • Patent ductus arteriosus. • The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the left lung artery to the aorta. • When a baby is growing in the womb, this vessel lets blood go around the lungs. • Shortly after birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes. • If it stays open, the opening is called a patent ductus arteriosus. • Holes in the heart. • Some people with coarctation of the aorta also are born with a hole in the heart. • If the hole is between the upper heart chambers, it is called an atrial septal defect. • A hole between the lower heart chambers is called a ventricular septal defect. • Congenital mitral valve stenosis. • This is a type of heart valve disease that some people are born with. • The valve between the upper and lower left heart chambers is narrowed. • It's harder for blood to move through the valve.",
      "Complications": "Complications of coarctation of the aorta happen because the left lower heart chamber has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed artery. • This makes blood pressure go up in the lower left heart chamber. • Also, the wall of the chamber can get thick. • This condition is called ventricular hypertrophy. • Complications of coarctation of the aorta include: Long-term high blood pressure. • Blood pressure usually drops after surgery to fix the aorta. • But it may still be higher than usual. • A weakened or bulging artery in the brain, also known as a brain aneurysm. • Bleeding in the brain. • A rupture or tear in the body's main artery, called an aortic dissection. • A bulge in the wall of the body's main artery, called an aortic aneurysm. • Coronary artery disease. • Stroke. • Prompt treatment is needed to help prevent complications. • Without treatment, coarctation of the aorta may lead to: Kidney failure. • Heart failure. • Death. • Some people have complications after treatment for coarctation of the aorta. • These complications include: Re-narrowing of the aorta, called re-coarctation. • Aortic aneurysm or rupture. • To prevent complications, people with coarctation of the aorta need regular health checkups for life.",
      "Prevention": "There's no known way to prevent coarctation of the aorta. • Tell your healthcare team if you have a family history of heart conditions present at birth."

      "Overview": "Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a common viral infection. • They are tiny, fluid-filled blisters on and around the lips. • These blisters are often grouped together in patches. • After the blisters break, a scab forms that can last several days. • Cold sores usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks without leaving a scar. • Cold sores spread from person to person by close contact, such as kissing. • They're usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and less commonly herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). • Both of these viruses can affect the mouth or genitals and can be spread by oral sex. • The virus can spread even if you don't see the sores. • There's no cure for cold sores, but treatment can help manage outbreaks. • Prescription antiviral medicine or creams can help sores heal more quickly. • And they may make future outbreaks happen less often and be shorter and less serious.",
      "Symptoms": "A cold sore usually passes through several stages: Tingling and itching. • Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form. • Blisters. • Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. • Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth. • Oozing and crusting. • The small blisters may merge and then burst. • This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over. • Symptoms vary, depending on whether this is your first outbreak or a recurrence. • The first time you have a cold sore, symptoms may not start for up to 20 days after you were first exposed to the virus. • The sores can last several days. • And the blisters can take 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely. • If blisters return, they'll often appear at the same spot each time and tend to be less severe than the first outbreak. • In a first-time outbreak, you also might experience: Fever. • Painful gums. • Sore throat. • Headache. • Muscle aches. • Swollen lymph nodes. • Children under 5 years old may have cold sores inside their mouths. • These sores are often mistaken for canker sores. • Canker sores involve only the mucous membrane and aren't caused by the herpes simplex virus. • Cold sores generally clear up without treatment. • See your health care provider if: You have a weak immune system. • The cold sores don't heal within two weeks. • Symptoms are severe. • The cold sores often return. • You have gritty or painful eyes. • Cold sores are caused by certain strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). • HSV-1 usually causes cold sores. • HSV-2 is often the cause of genital herpes. • But either type can spread to the face or genitals through close contact, such as kissing or oral sex. • Shared eating utensils, razors and towels can also spread HSV-1. • Cold sores are most likely to spread when you have oozing blisters. • But you can spread the virus even if you don't have blisters. • Many people who are infected with the virus that causes cold sores never develop symptoms. • Once you've had a herpes infection, the virus can hide in nerve cells in the skin and may cause another cold sore at the same place as before. • A return of cold sores may be triggered by: Viral infection or fever. • Hormonal changes, such as those related to a menstrual period. • Stress. • Fatigue. • Being in the sun or wind. • Changes in the immune system. • Injury to the skin. • Almost everyone is at risk of cold sores. • Most adults carry the virus that causes cold sores, even if they've never had symptoms. • You're most at risk of complications from the virus if you have a weak immune system from conditions and treatments such as: HIV/AIDS. • Atopic dermatitis (eczema). • Cancer chemotherapy. • Anti-rejection medicine for organ transplants. • In some people, the virus that causes cold sores can cause problems in other areas of the body, including: Fingertips. • Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread to the fingers. • This type of infection is often referred to as herpes whitlow. • Children who suck their thumbs may transfer the infection from their mouths to their thumbs. • Eyes. • The virus can sometimes cause eye infection. • Repeated infections can cause scarring and injury, which may lead to vision problems or loss of vision. • Widespread areas of skin. • People who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) are at higher risk of cold sores spreading all across their bodies. • This can become a medical emergency. • Your health care provider may prescribe an antiviral medicine for you to take on a regular basis if you develop cold sores more than nine times a year or if you're at high risk of serious complications. • If sunlight seems to trigger your condition, apply sunblock to the spot where the cold sore tends to form. • Or talk with your health care provider about using an oral antiviral medicine before you do an activity that tends to cause a cold sore to return. • Take these steps to help avoid spreading cold sores to other people: Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present. • The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid. • Avoid sharing items. • Utensils, towels, lip balm and other personal items can spread the virus when blisters are present. • Keep your hands clean. • When you have a cold sore, wash your hands carefully before touching yourself and other people, especially babies.",

      "Overview": "Colon cancer is a growth of cells that begins in a part of the large intestine called the colon. • The colon is the first and longest part of the large intestine. • The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. • The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use. • Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. • It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon. • Polyps generally aren't cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time. • Polyps often don't cause symptoms. • For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon. • Finding and removing polyps helps prevent colon cancer. • If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it. • Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. • Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer. • This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum.",
      "Symptoms": "Many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first. • When symptoms appear, they'll likely depend on the cancer's size and where it is in the large intestine. • Symptoms of colon cancer can include: A change in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhea or constipation. • Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. • Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain. • A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement. • Weakness or tiredness. • Losing weight without trying. • If you notice lasting symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with a health care professional. • Doctors aren't certain what causes most colon cancers. • Colon cancer happens when cells in the colon develop changes in their DNA. • A cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. • The changes let the cells continue living when healthy cells die as part of their natural lifecycle. • This causes too many cells. • The cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • Factors that may increase the risk of colon cancer include: Older age. • Colon cancer can happen at any age. • But most people with colon cancer are older than 50. • The numbers of people younger than 50 who have colon cancer has been growing. • Doctors don't know why. • Black race. • Black people in the United States have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races. • A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. • Having had colon cancer or colon polyps increases the risk of colon cancer. • Inflammatory bowel diseases. • Conditions that cause pain and swelling of the intestines, called inflammatory bowel diseases, can increase the risk of colon cancer. • These conditions include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. • Inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk. • Some DNA changes that increase the risk of colon cancer run in families. • The most common inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk are familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome. • Family history of colon cancer. • Having a blood relative who has colon cancer increases the risk of getting colon cancer. • Having more than one family member who has colon cancer or rectal cancer increases the risk more. • Low-fiber, high-fat diet. • Colon cancer and rectal cancer might be linked with a typical Western diet. • This type of diet tends to be low in fiber and high in fat and calories. • Research in this area has had mixed results. • Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat a lot of red meat and processed meat. • Not exercising regularly. • People who are not active are more likely to develop colon cancer. • Getting regular physical activity might help lower the risk. • Diabetes. • People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer. • Obesity. • People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer. • Obesity also increases the risk of dying of colon cancer. • Smoking. • People who smoke can have an increased risk of colon cancer. • Drinking alcohol. • Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of colon cancer. • Radiation therapy for cancer. • Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon cancer. • Doctors recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer consider starting colon cancer screening around age 45. • But people with an increased risk should think about starting screening sooner. • People with an increased risk include those with a family history of colon cancer. • There are several different tests that are used for colon cancer screening. • Talk about your options with your health care team. • Making changes in everyday life can reduce the risk of colon cancer. • To lower the risk of colon cancer: Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Fruits, vegetables and whole grains have vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help prevent cancer. • Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get a range of vitamins and nutrients. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day for women and two for men. • Stop smoking. • Talk to your health care team about ways to quit. • Exercise most days of the week. • Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. • If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. • Also, talk with a health care professional before starting an exercise program. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. • If you need to lose weight, ask your health care team about healthy ways to achieve your goal. • Aim to lose weight slowly by eating fewer calories and moving more. • Some medicines can reduce the risk of colon polyps or colon cancer. • For instance, some evidence links a reduced risk of polyps and colon cancer to regular use of aspirin or aspirin-like medicines. • But it's not clear what dose and what length of time would be needed to reduce the risk of colon cancer. • Taking aspirin daily has some risks, including ulcers and bleeding in the digestive system. • These options are generally reserved for people with a high risk of colon cancer. • There isn't enough evidence to recommend these medicines to people who have an average risk of colon cancer. • If you have an increased risk of colon cancer, discuss your risk factors with your health care team to see if preventive medicines are safe for you.",

      "Overview": "A colon polyp is a small clump of cells that forms on the lining of the colon. • Most colon polyps are harmless. • But over time, some colon polyps can develop into colon cancer. • Colon cancer can be fatal when found in its later stages. • Anyone can develop colon polyps. • You're at higher risk if you are 50 or older, are overweight or are a smoker. • You're also at higher risk if you have a personal or family history of colon polyps or colon cancer. • Colon polyps don't usually cause symptoms. • It's important to have regular screening tests because colon polyps found in the early stages can usually be removed safely and completely. • The best prevention for colon cancer is regular screening for and removal of polyps.",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with colon polyps do not have any symptoms. • You might not know you have a polyp until your health care provider finds it during an exam of your colon. • However, some people with colon polyps may have: Change in bowel habits. • Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may mean the presence of a larger colon polyp or cancer. • However, several other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits. • Change in stool color. • Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black. • A change in color also may be caused by certain foods, medicines or dietary supplements. • Iron deficiency anemia. • Bleeding from polyps can happen slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool. • Chronic bleeding may lead to iron deficiency anemia, which can make you feel tired and short of breath. • Pain. • A large colon polyp can block part of your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain. • Rectal bleeding. • This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears of the anus. • See your health care provider if you experience: Abdominal pain. • Blood in your stool. • A change in your bowel habits that lasts longer than a week. • You should be screened regularly for polyps if: You're age 50 or older. • You have risk factors, such as a family history of colon cancer. • Some high-risk individuals should begin regular screening much earlier than age 50. • Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way. • Changes in certain genes can cause cells to continue dividing even when new cells aren't needed. • In the colon and rectum, this continued growth of cells can cause polyps to form. • Polyps can grow anywhere in the large intestine. • There are two main categories of polyps, nonneoplastic and neoplastic. • Nonneoplastic polyps typically do not become cancerous. • Neoplastic polyps include adenomas and serrated types. • Adenomas are the most likely to turn into cancer if given enough time to grow. • Serrated polyps also may become cancerous, depending on their size and location. • In general for neoplastic polyps, the larger the polyp, the greater the risk of cancer. • Factors that might cause colon polyps or cancer include: Age. • Most people with colon polyps are 50 or older. • Having inflammatory intestinal conditions. • Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease of the colon increase your overall risk of colon cancer, although the polyps themselves are not a significant threat. • Family history. • You're more likely to get colon polyps or cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with them. • If many family members have them, your risk is even greater. • In some people, this connection isn't hereditary. • Smoking and excess alcohol use. • Studies show that people who have three or more alcoholic drinks a day have an increased risk of getting colon polyps. • Alcohol intake combined with smoking also appears to increase the risk. • Obesity, lack of exercise and fat intake. • You're at a higher risk if you are overweight, don't exercise regularly and lack a healthy diet. • Race. • Black Americans have a higher risk of developing colon cancer. • Rarely, people inherit genetic irregularities that cause colon polyps to form. • If you have one of these genes, you are at a much higher risk of developing colon cancer. • Screening and early detection can help prevent the growth or spread of these cancers. • Hereditary disorders that cause colon polyps include: Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. • People with Lynch syndrome tend to develop relatively few colon polyps, but those polyps can quickly become cancerous. • Lynch syndrome is the most common form of inherited colon cancer and also is associated with tumors in other parts of the abdomen. • Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a rare disorder that causes hundreds or even thousands of polyps to develop in the lining of your colon beginning during your teenage years. • If the polyps aren't treated, your risk of developing colon cancer is nearly 100%, usually before age 40. • Genetic testing can help determine your risk of FAP. • Gardner syndrome, a variant of FAP that causes polyps to develop throughout your colon and small intestine. • You also may develop noncancerous tumors in other parts of your body, including your skin, bones and abdomen. • MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), a condition similar to FAP that is caused by changes in the MYH gene. • People with MAP often develop multiple adenomatous polyps and colon cancer at a young age. • Genetic testing can help determine your risk of MAP. • Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a condition that usually begins with freckles developing all over the body, including the lips, gums and feet. • Then noncancerous polyps develop throughout the intestines. • These polyps may become cancerous, so people with this condition have a higher risk of colon cancer. • Serrated polyposis syndrome, a condition that leads to multiple serrated adenomatous polyps in the upper part of the colon. • These polyps may become cancerous. • They need to be watched and possibly removed. • Some colon polyps may become cancerous. • The earlier polyps are removed, the less likely it is that they will become cancerous. • You can greatly reduce your risk of colon polyps and colorectal cancer by having regular screenings. • Certain lifestyle changes also can help: Adopt healthy habits. • Include plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet and reduce your fat intake. • Limit alcohol and quit all tobacco use. • Stay physically active and maintain a healthy body weight. • Talk to your health care provider about calcium and vitamin D. • Studies have shown that increasing the intake of calcium may help prevent the return of colon adenomas. • But it isn't clear whether calcium has any protective benefits against colon cancer. • Other studies have shown that vitamin D may protect against colorectal cancer. • Consider your options if you're at high risk. • If you have a family history of colon polyps, consider having genetic counseling. • If you've been diagnosed with a hereditary disorder that causes colon polyps, you'll need regular colonoscopies starting in young adulthood.",

      "Overview": "Color blindness is an eye condition in which someone can't see the difference between certain colors. • Though many people commonly use the term \"color blind\" for this condition, true color blindness — in which everything is seen in shades of black and white — is rare. • The medical term for color blindness is known as color vision deficiency. • Color blindness is usually inherited, meaning it's passed down through families. • Men are more likely to be born with color blindness. • Most people with color blindness can't tell the difference between certain shades of red and green. • Less commonly, people with color blindness can't tell the difference between shades of blue and yellow. • Certain eye diseases and some medicines also can cause color blindness.",
      "Symptoms": "You may have a color vision deficiency and not know it. • Some people figure out that they or their child has the condition when it causes confusion — such as when there are problems differentiating the colors in a traffic light or interpreting color-coded learning materials. • People affected by color blindness may not be able to distinguish: Different shades of red and green. • Different shades of blue and yellow. • Any colors. • The most common color deficiency is an inability to see some shades of red and green. • Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely insensitive to both colors. • Defects can be mild, moderate or severe. • If you suspect you have problems distinguishing certain colors or your color vision changes, see an eye doctor for testing. • It's important that children get comprehensive eye exams, including color vision testing, before starting school. • There's no cure for inherited color deficiencies, but if illness or eye disease is the cause, treatment may improve color vision.",
      "Causes": "Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that begins with your eyes' ability to respond to different wavelengths of light. • Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters your eye through the cornea and passes through the lens and transparent, jellylike tissue in your eye (vitreous humor) to wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of your eye in the macular area of the retina. • The cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green) or long (red) wavelengths of light. • Chemicals in the cones trigger a reaction and send the wavelength information through your optic nerve to your brain. • If your eyes work as they should, you perceive color. • But if your cones don't work properly, you will be unable to distinguish the colors red, green or blue.",
      "Risk factors": "Several factors increase the risk of color blindness, including: Gender. • Colorblindness is much more common in males than in females. • Family history. • Colorblindness is often inherited, meaning it is passed down through families. • You can inherit a mild, moderate or severe degree of the condition. • Inherited color deficiencies usually affect both eyes, and the severity doesn't change over your lifetime. • Diseases. • Some conditions that can increase the risk of color deficiency include sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism and leukemia. • One eye may be more affected than the other, and the color deficiency may get better if the underlying disease can be treated. • Certain medicines. • Some medicines can affect color vision, such as hydrochloroquine, a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. • Damage to the eye. • Color blindness can be caused by trauma to the eye as a result of injury, surgery, radiation therapy or laser treatment."

      "Overview": "Coma is a state of prolonged loss of consciousness. • It can have a variety of causes, including traumatic head injury, stroke, brain tumor, or drug or alcohol intoxication. • A coma may even be caused by an underlying illness, such as diabetes or an infection. • Coma is a medical emergency. • Quick action is needed to preserve life and brain function. • Healthcare professionals typically order a series of blood tests and a brain scan to try to learn what's causing the coma so that proper treatment can begin. • A coma doesn't usually last longer than several weeks. • People who are unconscious for a longer time might transition to a lasting vegetative state, known as a persistent vegetative state, or brain death.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a coma commonly include: Closed eyes. • Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light. • No responses of limbs except for reflex movements. • No response to painful stimuli except for reflex movements. • Irregular breathing. • A coma is a medical emergency. • Seek immediate medical care for the person in a coma.",
      "Causes": "Many types of problems can cause a coma. • Some examples are: Traumatic brain injuries. • These are often caused by traffic collisions or acts of violence. • Stroke. • Reduced or stopped blood supply to the brain, known as a stroke, can result from blocked arteries or a burst blood vessel. • Tumors. • Tumors in the brain or brainstem can cause a coma. • Diabetes. • Blood sugar levels that become too high or too low can cause a coma. • Lack of oxygen. • People who have been rescued from drowning or revived after a heart attack might not awaken due to lack of oxygen to the brain. • Infections. • Infections such as encephalitis and meningitis cause swelling of the brain, spinal cord or the tissues that surround the brain. • Severe cases of these infections can result in brain damage or a coma. • Seizures. • Ongoing seizures can lead to a coma. • Toxins. • Exposure to toxins, such as carbon monoxide or lead, can cause brain damage and a coma. • Drugs and alcohol. • Overdosing on drugs or alcohol can result in a coma.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for coma include: Serious head injury. • Stroke. • Bleeding in and around the brain, known as an intracranial bleed. • Brain tumor. • Diabetes with blood sugar that's very high or very low. • Health conditions, such as hypothyroidism or very low sodium in the blood. • Very low blood pressure from serious heart failure. • Epilepsy, including having seizures that last more than five minutes or that happen one after another without the person regaining consciousness. • Serious infection, such as sepsis, encephalitis or meningitis. • Near drowning, which decreases oxygen to the brain. • Excessive use of alcohol or use of illegal drugs. • Exposure to carbon monoxide, lead or other toxins. • The risk of coma goes up with age. • This is especially true if older adults: Have a brain disease or another condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease. • Take several medicines, which can lead to drug interactions or accidental overdose.",
      "Complications": "Although many people gradually recover from a coma, others enter a persistent vegetative state or die. • Some people who recover from a coma end up with major or minor disabilities. • During a coma, bedsores, urinary tract infections, blood clots in the legs and other problems may develop."

      "Overview": "The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat. • Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. • Germs called viruses cause a common cold. • Often, adults may have two or three colds each year. • Infants and young children may have colds more often. • Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. • Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. • Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. • If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider. • Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections. • Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. • Symptoms vary. • They can include: Runny or stuffy nose. • Sore or scratchy throat. • Cough. • Sneezing. • Generally feeling unwell. • Slight body aches or a mild headache. • Low-grade fever. • The mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green. • This change is normal. • Most often, it doesn't mean that you have a bacterial illness. • For adults. • Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. • But see your health care provider if you have: Symptoms that get worse or do not get better. • Fever greater than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius) that lasts more than three days. • Fever returning after a fever-free period. • Shortness of breath. • Wheezing. • Intense sore throat, headache or sinus pain. • For children. • Most children with a common cold don't need to see a health care provider. • Get medical care right away if your child has any of the following: Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in newborns up to 12 weeks. • Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age. • More-intense symptoms, such as headache, throat pain or cough. • Trouble with breathing or wheezing. • Ear pain. • Fussiness or drowsiness that isn't typical. • No interest in eating. • Many viruses can cause a common cold. • Rhinoviruses are the most common cause. • A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. • The virus can spread by: Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. • Hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold. • Sharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones. • Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus. • These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold: Age. • Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings. • Weakened immune system. • Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk. • Time of year. • Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter. • Smoking. • Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold. • Exposure. • Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold. • These conditions can occur along with your cold: Middle ear infection. • This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. • It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. • Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold. • Asthma. • A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. • For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse. • Sinusitis. • In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. • These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. • A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis. • Other illnesses. • A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. • People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions. • There's no vaccine for the common cold. • You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness: Wash your hands. • Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. • Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. • Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. • Clean and disinfect. • Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. • These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. • This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. • Wash children's toys often. • Cover your cough. • Sneeze and cough into tissues. • Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. • If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands. • Don't share. • Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members. • Stay away from people with colds. • Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. • Stay out of crowds when possible. • Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds. • Review your child care center's policies. • Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home. • Take care of yourself. • Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.",

      "Symptoms": "How bad symptoms are varies greatly between people with CVID. • Symptoms of common variable immunodeficiency may appear during childhood or the teen years. • But many people don't get symptoms until they're adults. • If you have CVID, you'll likely have repeated infections before being diagnosed. • The most common types of infections include pneumonia, sinusitis, ear infections and gastrointestinal infections.",
      "Causes": "In most CVID cases, the cause is unknown. • In around 10% of people with CVID, a gene change has been found. • Researchers believe that the condition is caused by a mix of factors in the environment and in genes. • As of now, the environmental factors are unclear."

      "Overview": "Common warts are small, grainy skin growths that occur most often on the fingers or hands. • They're rough to the touch and often have tiny black dots. • These dots are clotted blood vessels. • Common warts are caused by a virus and are transmitted by touch. • It can take 2 to 6 months for a wart to develop. • The warts are usually harmless and over time go away on their own. • But many people choose to remove them because they find them bothersome or embarrassing.",
      "Symptoms": "Common warts symptoms include: Small, fleshy, grainy bumps on the fingers or hands. • Feeling rough to the touch. • A sprinkling of black dots, which are clotted blood vessels. • See a healthcare professional for common warts if: The growths hurt, bleed, burn or itch. • You've tried treating the warts, but they persist, spread or come back. • The growths are bothersome or interfere with activities. • You're unsure whether the growths are warts. • You have many warts. • You have a weak immune system. • Warts show up on the face, feet or genitals. • Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus, also called HPV. • There are more than 100 types of this common virus, but only a few cause warts on the hands. • Some strains of HPV are spread through sexual contact. • But most are spread by casual skin contact or shared objects, such as towels or washcloths. • The virus usually spreads through breaks in the skin, such as hangnails or scrapes. • Biting your nails also can cause warts to spread on your fingertips and around your nails. • Each person's immune system responds to HPV differently. • So not everyone who comes in contact with HPV develops warts. • People at higher risk of developing common warts include: Children and young adults. • People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have had organ transplants. • People with the habit of nail biting or picking at hangnails. • To help prevent common warts: Don't touch or pick at warts, including your own. • Don't use the same emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts as you use on healthy skin and nails. • Use a disposable emery board. • Don't bite your fingernails or pick at hangnails. • Groom with care. • And avoid brushing, clipping or shaving areas that have warts. • Avoid shared hot tubs, showers and warm baths. • And don't share washcloths or towels. • Use hand moisturizer daily. • This helps prevent dry, cracked skin.",

      "Overview": "Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. • Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. • Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward. • For some people, feelings of loss are debilitating and don't improve even after time passes. • This is known as complicated grief, sometimes called persistent complex bereavement disorder. • In complicated grief, painful emotions are so long lasting and severe that you have trouble recovering from the loss and resuming your own life. • Different people follow different paths through the grieving experience. • The order and timing of these phases may vary from person to person: Accepting the reality of your loss Allowing yourself to experience the pain of your loss Adjusting to a new reality in which the deceased is no longer present Having other relationships These differences are normal. • But if you're unable to move through these stages more than a year after the death of a loved one, you may have complicated grief. • If so, seek treatment. • It can help you come to terms with your loss and reclaim a sense of acceptance and peace.",
      "Symptoms": "During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. • However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse. • Complicated grief is like being in an ongoing, heightened state of mourning that keeps you from healing. • Signs and symptoms of complicated grief may include: Intense sorrow, pain and rumination over the loss of your loved one Focus on little else but your loved one's death Extreme focus on reminders of the loved one or excessive avoidance of reminders Intense and persistent longing or pining for the deceased Problems accepting the death Numbness or detachment Bitterness about your loss Feeling that life holds no meaning or purpose Lack of trust in others Inability to enjoy life or think back on positive experiences with your loved one Complicated grief also may be indicated if you continue to: Have trouble carrying out normal routines Isolate from others and withdraw from social activities Experience depression, deep sadness, guilt or self-blame Believe that you did something wrong or could have prevented the death Feel life isn't worth living without your loved one Wish you had died along with your loved one Contact your doctor or a mental health professional if you have intense grief and problems functioning that don't improve at least one year after the passing of your loved one. • At times, people with complicated grief may consider suicide. • If you're thinking about suicide, talk to someone you trust. • If you think you may act on suicidal feelings, call 911 or your local emergency services number right away. • Or contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential.",
      "Causes": "It's not known what causes complicated grief. • As with many mental health disorders, it may involve your environment, your personality, inherited traits and your body's natural chemical makeup.",
      "Risk factors": "Complicated grief occurs more often in females and with older age. • Factors that may increase the risk of developing complicated grief include: An unexpected or violent death, such as death from a car accident, or the murder or suicide of a loved one Death of a child Close or dependent relationship to the deceased person Social isolation or loss of a support system or friendships Past history of depression, separation anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Traumatic childhood experiences, such as abuse or neglect Other major life stressors, such as major financial hardships",
      "Complications": "Complicated grief can affect you physically, mentally and socially. • Without appropriate treatment, complications may include: Depression Suicidal thoughts or behaviors Anxiety, including PTSD Significant sleep disturbances Increased risk of physical illness, such as heart disease, cancer or high blood pressure Long-term difficulty with daily living, relationships or work activities Alcohol, nicotine use or substance misuse",
      "Prevention": "It's not clear how to prevent complicated grief. • Getting counseling soon after a loss may help, especially for people at increased risk of developing complicated grief. • In addition, caregivers providing end-of-life care for a loved one may benefit from counseling and support to help prepare for death and its emotional aftermath. • Talking. • Talking about your grief and allowing yourself to cry also can help prevent you from getting stuck in your sadness. • As painful as it is, trust that in most cases, your pain will start to lift if you allow yourself to feel it. • Support. • Family members, friends, social support groups and your faith community are all good options to help you work through your grief. • You may be able to find a support group focused on a particular type of loss, such as the death of a spouse or a child. • Ask your doctor to recommend local resources. • Bereavement counseling. • Through early counseling after a loss, you can explore emotions surrounding your loss and learn healthy coping skills. • This may help prevent negative thoughts and beliefs from gaining such a strong hold that they're difficult to overcome."

      "Overview": "Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. • It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. • This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life. • Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. • Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. • But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior. • No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. • But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.",
      "Symptoms": "Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include: You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control. • You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret. • You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior. • You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. • You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. • These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems. • You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships. • Ask for help if you feel you've lost control of your sexual behavior, especially if your behavior causes problems for you or other people. • Compulsive sexual behavior tends to get worse over time without treatment, so get help when you first notice a problem. • As you decide whether to seek professional help, ask yourself: Can I manage my sexual impulses? Am I distressed by my sexual behaviors? Is my sexual behavior hurting my relationships, affecting my work or causing serious problems, such as getting arrested? Do I try to hide my sexual behavior? Getting help for compulsive sexual behavior can be difficult because it's such a deeply personal and private matter. • Try to: Set aside any shame or embarrassment and focus on the benefits of getting treatment. • Remember that you're not alone — many people struggle with compulsive sexual behavior. • Mental health professionals are trained to be understanding and not judge people. • But not all mental health providers are experienced in treating this condition. • Look for a provider who has experience in diagnosing and treating compulsive sexual behavior. • Keep in mind that what you say to a health care or mental health provider is private. • But providers are required to make a report if you tell them that you're going to hurt yourself or someone else. • They also are required to report if you give information about sexual abuse of a child or abuse or neglect of someone who is vulnerable, such as an elderly or disabled person. • Ask a health care provider for help right away if: You think you may hurt yourself or others because of uncontrolled sexual behavior. • You feel like your sexual behavior is slipping out of control. • You're thinking of taking your own life. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, every day. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • Although the exact causes of compulsive sexual behavior are not clear, possible causes may include: Changes in brain pathways. • Compulsive sexual behavior, over time, might cause changes in the brain's pathways, called neural circuits. • This may happen especially in areas of the brain that are related to reinforcement. • Over time, more-intense sexual content and stimulation are usually needed to get satisfaction or relief. • An imbalance of natural brain chemicals. • Certain chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters — such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine — help control your mood. • When these are out of balance, your sexual desire and behavior could be affected. • Conditions that affect the brain. • Certain health conditions, such as dementia, may cause damage to parts of the brain that affect sexual behavior. • Also, treatment of Parkinson's disease with certain medicines may cause compulsive sexual behavior. • Compulsive sexual behavior can happen in both men and women, though it may be more common in men. • It can affect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation. • Factors that may increase the risk of compulsive sexual behavior include: How easy it is to get sexual content. • Advances in technology and social media give people easy access to intense sexual images and information. • Privacy. • The secret and private nature of compulsive sexual activities can allow these problems to worsen over time. • Also, the risk of compulsive sexual behavior may be higher in people who have: Problems with alcohol or drug use. • Another mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety or a gambling addiction. • Family conflicts or family members with problems such as addiction. • A history of physical or sexual abuse. • Compulsive sexual behavior can cause many problems that affect both you and others. • You may: Struggle with feelings of guilt, shame and low self-esteem. • Develop other mental health conditions, such as depression, severe distress and anxiety. • You also may think about or attempt suicide. • Neglect or lie to your partner and family, harming or destroying important relationships. • Lose your focus or engage in sexual activity or search internet pornography at work, risking your job. • Have financial problems from buying pornography, internet or telephone sex, and sexual services. • Get HIV, hepatitis or another sexually transmitted infection, or pass a sexually transmitted infection to someone else. • Have problems with drugs and alcohol, such as using recreational drugs or drinking too much alcohol. • Get arrested for sexual offenses. • Because the cause of compulsive sexual behavior isn't known, it's not clear how to prevent it. • But a few things may help you keep control of problem behavior: Get help early for problems with sexual behavior. • Identifying and treating early problems may help prevent compulsive sexual behavior from getting worse over time. • Getting help also may prevent shame, relationship problems and harmful acts from getting worse. • Seek treatment early for mental health conditions. • Depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions can make compulsive sexual behavior worse. • Get help for problems with alcohol and drug use. • These can cause a loss of control that leads to poor judgment and sexual behaviors that aren't healthy. • Avoid risky situations. • Don't risk your health or that of others by putting yourself into situations where you'll be tempted to engage in risky sexual activities.",

      "Overview": "A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that affects brain function. • Effects are often short term and can include headaches and trouble with concentration, memory, balance, mood and sleep. • Concussions usually are caused by an impact to the head or body that is associated with a change in brain function. • Not everyone who experiences a blow to the body or head has a concussion. • Some concussions cause the person to lose consciousness, but most do not. • Falls are the most common cause of concussions. • Concussions also are common among athletes who play a contact sport, such as American football or soccer. • Most people recover fully after a concussion.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away. • Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer. • Common symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury are headache, confusion and loss of memory, known as amnesia. • The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion. • Physical symptoms of a concussion may include: Headache. • Ringing in the ears. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Fatigue or drowsiness. • Blurry vision. • Other symptoms of a concussion include: Confusion or feeling as if in a fog. • Amnesia surrounding the event. • Dizziness or \"seeing stars.\" A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion: Temporary loss of consciousness, though this doesn't always occur. • Slurred speech. • Delayed response to questions. • Dazed appearance. • Forgetfulness, such as asking the same question over and over. • Some symptoms of a concussion occur right away. • But sometimes symptoms may not occur for days after the injury, such as: Trouble with concentration and memory. • Irritability and other personality changes. • Sensitivity to light and noise. • Trouble with sleep. • Feeling emotional or depressed. • Changes in taste and smell. • Concussions can be hard to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel. • Concussion clues may include: Dazed appearance. • Listlessness and tiring easily. • Irritability and crankiness. • Loss of balance and unsteady walking. • Excessive crying. • Change in eating or sleeping patterns. • Lack of interest in favorite toys. • Vomiting. • See a healthcare professional within 1 to 2 days if: You or your child experiences a head injury, even if emergency care isn't required. • Children and adolescents need to see a healthcare professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions. • Seek emergency care for an adult or child who experiences a head injury and any of these symptoms: Repeated vomiting or nausea. • A loss of consciousness lasting longer than 30 seconds. • A headache that gets worse over time. • Fluid or blood draining from the nose or ears. • Vision or eye changes. • For example, the black parts of the eye, known as the pupils, may be bigger than usual or unequal sizes. • Ringing in the ears that doesn't go away. • Weakness in the arms or legs. • Changes in behavior. • Confusion or disorientation. • For example, the person may not recognize people or places. • Slurred speech or other changes in speech. • Obvious changes to mental function. • Changes in physical coordination, such as stumbling or clumsiness. • Seizures or convulsions. • Dizziness that doesn't go away or that goes away and comes back. • Symptoms that worsen over time. • Large head bumps or bruises, such as bruises around the eyes or behind the ears. • It's especially important to seek emergency care if these symptoms appear in infants under 12 months of age. • Never return to play or vigorous activity immediately following a concussion. • Experts recommend that adult, child and adolescent athletes with concussions not return to play on the same day as the injury. • Even if a concussion is suspected, experts recommend not returning to activities that can put the athlete at risk of another concussion. • Gradual return to learning and physical activity is individual and depends on the symptoms. • It should always be supervised by a healthcare professional. • During a concussion, the brain slides back and forth against the inner walls of the skull. • This forceful movement can be caused by a violent blow to the head and neck or upper body. • It also may be caused by the sudden acceleration or deceleration of the head. • This may happen during a car crash, a fall from a bike or from a collision with another player in sports. • These movements injure the brain and affect brain function, usually for a brief period of time. • Sometimes a mild traumatic brain injury can lead to bleeding in or around the brain, causing prolonged drowsiness, confusion and, sometimes, death. • Anyone who experiences a brain injury needs to be monitored in the hours afterward and seek emergency care if symptoms worsen. • Events and factors that may increase the risk of a concussion include: Activities that can lead to falls, especially in young children and older adults. • High-risk sports such as American football, hockey, soccer, rugby, boxing or other contact sports. • Not using proper safety equipment and supervision when playing high-risk sports. • Auto accidents. • Pedestrian or bicycle accidents. • Military combat. • Physical abuse. • Having had a previous concussion also increases the risk of having another. • Potential complications of concussion include: Post-traumatic headaches. • Some people experience concussion-related headaches for several days to weeks after a brain injury. • Post-traumatic vertigo. • Some people experience a sense of spinning or dizziness for days or weeks after a brain injury. • Persistent post-concussive symptoms, also known as post-concussion syndrome. • A small number of people may have multiple symptoms that last longer than expected. • Longer lasting symptoms may include headaches, dizziness and trouble with thinking. • If these symptoms persist beyond three months, they're called persistent post-concussive symptoms. • Effects of multiple brain injuries. • Researchers are studying the effects of repeated head injuries that don't cause symptoms, known as subconcussive injury. • At this time, there's no conclusive evidence that these repeated brain injuries affect brain function. • Second impact syndrome. • Rarely, experiencing a second concussion before symptoms of a first concussion go away may result in rapid brain swelling. • This can lead to death. • It's important that athletes never return to sports while they're still experiencing symptoms of concussion. • These tips may help you prevent or minimize the risk of a concussion: Wear protective gear during sports and other recreational activities. • Make sure the equipment fits properly, is well maintained and is worn correctly. • Follow the rules of the game and practice good sportsmanship. • Be sure to wear a helmet when bicycling, motorcycling, snowboarding or doing any activity that may result in a head injury. • Buckle your seat belt. • Wearing a seat belt may prevent serious injury, including head injury, during a traffic accident. • Make your home safe. • Keep your home well lit. • Keep your floors free of anything that might cause you to trip and fall. • Falls around the home are a leading cause of head injury. • Protect your children. • To help lessen the risk of head injuries in children, block off stairways and install window guards. • Exercise regularly. • Exercise strengthens your leg muscles and improves your balance. • Educate others about concussions. • Educate coaches, athletes, parents and others about concussions to help spread awareness. • Coaches and parents also can help encourage good sportsmanship.",

      "Overview": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the medical name for a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands. • The adrenal glands are a pair of walnut-sized organs above the kidneys. • They make important hormones, including: Cortisol. • This controls the body's response to illness or stress. • Mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. • These control sodium and potassium levels. • Androgens such as testosterone. • These sex hormones are needed for growth and development in both males and females. • In people with CAH, a gene change results in a lack of one of the enzyme proteins needed to make these hormones. • The two major types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are: Classic CAH. • This type is rarer and more serious. • It's usually found by tests at birth or in early infancy. • Nonclassic CAH. • This type is milder and more common. • It may not be found until childhood or early adulthood. • There is no cure for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • But with proper treatment, most people who have CAH can lead full lives.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of CAH vary. • The symptoms depend on which gene is affected. • They also depend on how greatly the adrenal glands lack one of the enzymes needed to make hormones. • With CAH, the hormones that the body needs to work properly are thrown out of balance. • That may lead to too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, too many androgens or a mix of these issues. • Symptoms of classic CAH can include: Not enough cortisol. • With classic CAH, the body doesn't make enough of the hormone cortisol. • This can cause problems keeping blood pressure, blood sugar and energy at healthy levels. • It also can cause problems during physical stress such as illness. • Adrenal crisis. • People with classic CAH can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. • This is known as an adrenal crisis. • It can be life-threatening. • External genitals that don't look typical. • In female infants, some parts of the genitals on the outside of the body may look different than usual. • For instance, the clitoris may be enlarged and resemble a penis. • The labia may be partly closed and look like a scrotum. • The tube through which urine leaves the body and the vagina may be one opening instead of two separate openings. • The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries often develop in a typical manner. • Male infants with CAH often have genitals that look typical but sometimes are enlarged. • Too much androgen. • An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can lead to short height and early puberty for children. • Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. • Serious acne also may occur. • Extra androgen hormones in females may lead to facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice. • Altered growth. • Children may grow fast. • And their bones could be more developed than is typical for their age. • Final height may be shorter than average. • Fertility issues. • These can include irregular menstrual periods or not having periods at all. • Some women with classic CAH may have trouble becoming pregnant. • Fertility issues sometimes can occur in men. • Often, there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. • Some people with nonclassic CAH never have symptoms. • The condition is not found on routine infant blood screening tests. • If symptoms occur, they usually appear in late childhood or early adulthood. • Females who have nonclassic CAH may have genitals that look typical at birth. • Later in life, they may have: Irregular menstrual periods, or none at all. • Trouble getting pregnant. • Features such as facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice. • Sometimes, nonclassic CAH may be confused with a hormonal condition that happens during the reproductive years called polycystic ovary syndrome. • Nonclassic CAH symptoms in children of either birth sex also can include: Symptoms of early puberty, such as growth of pubic hair sooner than usual. • Serious acne. • Rapid growth during childhood with bones that are more developed than is typical. • Shorter than expected final height. • Most often, classic CAH is found at birth through routine newborn screening tests. • Or it's found when a baby's outer genitals do not look typical. • CAH also may be detected when infants show symptoms of serious illness due to low levels of cortisol, aldosterone or both. • In children who have nonclassic CAH, symptoms of early puberty may appear. • If you have concerns about your child's growth or development, schedule a checkup with your child's healthcare professional. • In older people who have irregular periods, trouble getting pregnant or both, screening for CAH may be appropriate. • If you are planning pregnancy or are pregnant and may be at risk of CAH, ask your healthcare professional about genetic counseling. • A genetic counselor can tell you if your genes might affect you or any children you decide to have.",
      "Causes": "The most common cause of CAH is the lack of the enzyme protein known as 21-hydroxylase. • Sometimes, CAH is called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. • The body needs this enzyme to make proper amounts of hormones. • Very rarely, a lack of other much rarer enzymes also can cause CAH. • CAH is a genetic condition. • That means it's passed from parents to children. • It's present at birth. • Children with the condition have two parents who both carry the genetic change that causes CAH. • Or they have two parents who have CAH themselves. • This is known as the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. • People can carry the CAH gene and not have symptoms of the condition. • This is called being a silent carrier. • If a silent carrier becomes pregnant, that person can pass the gene to a child. • If tests show that you're a silent carrier of the CAH gene and you have a partner of the opposite sex, talk with your healthcare professional. • It's likely that your partner will need to get tested for the CAH gene before pregnancy so that you can better understand the risks.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that raise the risk of having CAH include: Parents who both have CAH. • Parents who are both carriers of the changed gene that causes CAH. • Being of Ashkenazi Jewish, Latino, Mediterranean, Yugoslav or Yup'ik descent.",
      "Complications": "People who have classic CAH are at risk of a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis. • This emergency needs to be treated right away. • Adrenal crisis can happen within the first few days after birth. • It also can be triggered at any age by an infectious illness or physical stress such as surgery. • With adrenal crisis, very low levels of cortisol in the blood can cause: Diarrhea. • Vomiting. • Dehydration. • Confusion. • Low blood sugar levels. • Seizures. • Shock. • Coma. • Aldosterone also may be low. • This leads to dehydration, low sodium and high potassium levels. • The nonclassic form of CAH doesn't cause adrenal crisis. • People who have either classic or nonclassic CAH may have irregular menstrual cycles and fertility issues.",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent CAH. • If you're thinking of starting a family and you're at risk of having a child with CAH, talk with your healthcare professional. • You may be told to see a genetic counselor."

      "Overview": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition that happens in a baby before birth. • It occurs early in pregnancy when a baby's diaphragm — the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen — fails to close as it should. • This leaves a hole in the diaphragm. • The hole is called a hernia. • This hernia in the muscle of the diaphragm creates an opening between the abdomen and the chest. • The intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs may move through the hole into the baby's chest. • If the intestines are in the chest, they don't develop the typical connections that hold them in place in the abdomen (malrotation). • They may twist on themselves, cutting off their blood supply (volvulus). • In addition, the lung is small on the side of the diaphragm with the hernia, but the development of both lungs is affected. • The air sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs don't develop as they should. • This results in problems with blood flow and increased pressure inside the lung's blood vessels. • The blood pressure in the lungs is higher than it should be, which can make it hard for the baby to breathe after birth. • Some infants may also have problems with heart development. • Treatment of CDH depends on when the condition is found, how serious it is and whether there are problems with the heart.",
      "Symptoms": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ranges in severity. • It may be mild and have few or no effects on the baby, or it can be more serious and affect the ability to bring oxygen to the rest of the body. • Babies born with CDH may have: Severe trouble breathing due to small lungs that don't work well (pulmonary hypoplasia). • A type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart (pulmonary hypertension). • Problems with development of the heart. • Damage to the intestines, stomach, liver and other abdominal organs if they move through the hernia into the chest. • CDH may be found during a routine fetal ultrasound. • Your health care provider can discuss treatment options with you.",
      "Causes": "In most cases, the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not known. • In some cases, CDH can be linked to a genetic disorder or random gene changes called mutations. • In these cases, the baby may have more issues at birth, such as problems with the heart, eyes, arms and legs, or stomach and intestines.",
      "Complications": "Complications that can occur with CDH include: Lung problems. • Stomach, intestine and liver problems. • Heart disease. • Recurrent infections. • Hearing loss. • Changes in the shape of the chest and curve of the spine. • Gastroesophageal reflux — stomach acid flowing back into the tube called the esophagus, which connects the mouth and stomach. • Problems with growth and weight gain. • Developmental delays and learning disabilities. • Other problems present from birth."

      "Overview": "A congenital heart defect is a problem with the structure of the heart that a child is born with. • Some congenital heart defects in children are simple and don't need treatment. • Others are more complex. • The child may need several surgeries done over a period of several years.",
      "Symptoms": "Serious congenital heart defects usually are found soon after birth or during the first few months of life. • Symptoms could include: Pale gray or blue lips, tongue, or fingernails. • Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see. • Rapid breathing. • Swelling in the legs, belly or areas around the eyes. • Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain. • Less-serious congenital heart defects may not be found until later in childhood. • Symptoms of congenital heart defects in older children may include: Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity. • Getting tired very easily during exercise or activity. • Fainting during exercise or activity. • Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet. • Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. • If you think that your baby has symptoms of a heart condition, call your child's healthcare professional.",
      "Causes": "To understand the causes of congenital heart defects, it may help to know how the heart usually works. • The typical heart has four chambers. • There are two on the right and two on the left. • The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • To pump blood through the body, the heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks. • The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through the lung arteries, called the pulmonary arteries. • In the lungs, the blood gets oxygen. • The blood then goes to the heart's left side through the pulmonary veins. • The left side of the heart pumps the blood through the body's main artery, called the aorta. • It then goes to the rest of the body. • During the first six weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart begins to form and starts to beat. • The major blood vessels that go to and from the heart also begin to form during this critical time. • It's at this point in a baby's development that congenital heart defects may begin to develop. • Researchers aren't sure what causes most types of congenital heart defects. • They think that gene changes, certain medicines or health conditions, and environmental or lifestyle factors, such as smoking, may play a role. • There are many types of congenital heart defects. • They fall into the general categories described below. • Changes in connections, also called altered connections, let blood flow where it usually wouldn't. • An altered connection can cause oxygen-poor blood to mix with oxygen-rich blood. • This lowers the amount of oxygen sent through the body. • The change in blood flow forces the heart and lungs to work harder. • Types of altered connections in the heart or blood vessels include: Atrial septal defect is a hole between the upper heart chambers, called the atria. • Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • Patent ductus arteriosus (PAY-tunt DUK-tus ahr-teer-e-O-sus) is a connection between the lung artery and the body's main artery, called the aorta. • It's open while a baby is growing in the womb, and typically closes a few hours after birth. • But in some babies, it stays open, causing incorrect blood flow between the two arteries. • Total or partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection occurs when all or some of the blood vessels from the lungs, called the pulmonary veins, attach to a wrong area or areas of the heart. • Heart valves are like doorways between the heart chambers and the blood vessels. • Heart valves open and close to keep blood moving in the proper direction. • If the heart valves can't open and close correctly, blood can't flow smoothly. • Heart valve problems include valves that are narrowed and don't open completely or valves that don't close completely. • Examples of congenital heart valve problems include: Aortic stenosis (stuh-NO-sis). • A baby may be born with an aortic valve that has one or two valve flaps, called cusps, instead of three. • This creates a small, narrowed opening for blood to pass through. • The heart must work harder to pump blood through the valve. • Eventually, the heart gets bigger and the heart muscle gets thicker. • Pulmonary stenosis. • The pulmonary valve opening is narrowed. • This slows the blood flow. • Ebstein anomaly. • The tricuspid valve — which is located between the right upper heart chamber and the right lower chamber — is not its usual shape. • It often leaks. • Some infants are born with several congenital heart defects. • Very complex ones may cause significant changes in blood flow or undeveloped heart chambers. • Examples include: Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW). • There are four changes to the heart's shape and structure. • There's a hole in the wall between the heart's lower chambers and thickened muscle in the lower right chamber. • The path between the lower heart chamber and pulmonary artery is narrowed. • There also is a shift in the connection of the aorta to the heart. • Pulmonary atresia. • The valve that lets blood out of the heart to go to the lungs, called the pulmonary valve, isn't formed correctly. • Blood can't travel its usual path to get oxygen from the lungs. • Tricuspid atresia. • The tricuspid valve isn't formed. • Instead, there's solid tissue between the right upper heart chamber and the right lower chamber. • This condition limits blood flow. • It causes the right lower chamber to be underdeveloped. • Transposition of the great arteries. • In this serious, rare congenital heart defect, the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed, also called transposed. • There are two types. • Complete transposition of the great arteries is typically noticed during pregnancy or soon after birth. • It also is called dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA). • Levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) is less common. • Symptoms may not be noticed right away. • Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. • A major part of the heart fails to develop properly. • The left side of the heart hasn't developed enough to successfully pump enough blood to the body.",
      "Risk factors": "Most congenital heart defects result from changes that occur early as the baby's heart is developing before birth. • The exact cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown. • But some risk factors have been identified. • Risk factors for congenital heart defects include: Rubella, also called German measles. • Having rubella during pregnancy can cause changes in a baby's heart development. • A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you're immune to rubella. • A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune. • Diabetes. • Careful control of blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. • Diabetes that develops during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. • It generally doesn't increase a baby's risk of heart defects. • Some medicines. • Taking certain medicines during pregnancy can cause congenital heart disease and other health problems present at birth. • Medicines linked to congenital heart defects include lithium (Lithobid) for bipolar disorder and isotretinoin (Claravis, Myorisan, others), which is used to treat acne. • Always tell your healthcare team about the medicines you take. • Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. • Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. • Smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. • Genetics. • Congenital heart defects appear to run in families, which means they are inherited. • Changes in genes have been linked to heart problems present at birth. • For instance, people with Down syndrome are often born with heart conditions.",
      "Complications": "Possible complications of a congenital heart defect include: Congestive heart failure. • This serious complication may develop in babies who have a severe congenital heart defect. • Symptoms of congestive heart failure include rapid breathing, often with gasping breaths, and poor weight gain. • Infection of the lining of the heart and heart valves, called endocarditis. • Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke. • Antibiotics may be recommended before dental care to prevent this infection. • Regular dental checkups are important. • Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk of endocarditis. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Scar tissue in the heart from surgeries to fix a congenital heart condition can lead to changes in heart signaling. • The changes can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. • Some irregular heartbeats may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated. • Slower growth and development (developmental delays). • Children with more-serious congenital heart defects often develop and grow more slowly than do children who don't have heart defects. • They may be smaller than other children of the same age. • If the nervous system has been affected, a child may learn to walk and talk later than other children. • Stroke. • Although uncommon, a congenital heart defect can let a blood clot pass through the heart and travel to the brain, causing a stroke. • Mental health disorders. • Some children with congenital heart defects may develop anxiety or stress because of developmental delays, activity restrictions or learning difficulties. • Talk to your child's healthcare professional if you're concerned about your child's mental health. • Complications of congenital heart defects may occur years after the heart condition is treated.",
      "Prevention": "Because the exact cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown, it may not be possible to prevent these conditions. • If you have a high risk of giving birth to a child with a congenital heart defect, genetic testing and screening may be done during pregnancy. • There are some steps you can take to help reduce your child's overall risk of heart problems present at birth such as: Get proper prenatal care. • Regular checkups with a healthcare professional during pregnancy can help keep mom and baby healthy. • Take a multivitamin with folic acid. • Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to prevent harmful changes in the baby's brain and spinal cord. • It also may help reduce the risk of congenital heart defects as well. • Don't drink or smoke. • These lifestyle habits can harm a baby's health. • Also avoid secondhand smoke. • Get a rubella vaccine. • Also called German measles, having rubella during pregnancy may affect a baby's heart development. • Get vaccinated before trying to get pregnant. • Control blood sugar. • If you have diabetes, good control of your blood sugar can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects. • Manage chronic health conditions. • If you have other health conditions, talk to your healthcare professional about the best way to treat and manage them. • Avoid harmful substances. • During pregnancy, have someone else do any painting and cleaning with strong-smelling products. • Tell your care team about your medicines. • Some medicines can cause congenital heart defects and other health conditions present at birth. • Tell your care team about all the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription."

      "Overview": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a group of rare hereditary conditions caused by a gene change that results in muscle weakness, which worsens with physical activity. • Any muscles used for movement can be affected, including muscles that control speaking, chewing and swallowing, seeing and blinking, breathing, and walking. • There are many types of congenital myasthenic syndromes, depending on which gene is affected. • The changed gene also determines many of the signs and symptoms and severity of the condition. • Congenital myasthenic syndromes are usually identified at birth or early childhood and are lifelong conditions. • There is no cure for congenital myasthenic syndromes. • Medications are generally an effective treatment for muscle weakness symptoms. • Which medication works depends on which gene is identified as the cause of the congenital myasthenic syndrome. • Rarely, some children may have a mild form that doesn't need treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Congenital myasthenic syndromes are typically identified at birth. • But if signs and symptoms are mild, the condition may not be identified until childhood, or rarely, early adulthood. • Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, the severity of signs and symptoms vary greatly, from minor weakness to the inability to move. • Some symptoms can be life-threatening. • Common to all congenital myasthenic syndromes is muscle weakness that worsens with physical activity. • Any muscles used for movement can be affected, but the most commonly affected muscles are those that control movement of the eyelids and eyes and chewing and swallowing. • During infancy and early childhood, progressive loss of essential voluntary muscle activity occurs with muscle use. • Impaired muscle weakness can result in: Droopy eyelids and poor eye control, often with double vision. • Difficulty chewing and swallowing. • Weakness of facial muscles. • Weak cry. • Slurring or nasal speech. • Delayed crawling and walking. • Delayed development of wrist, hand and finger skills, such as brushing teeth or combing hair. • Trouble supporting the head in an upright position. • Problems breathing, such as feeling short of breath and having short pauses in breathing, sometimes worsened by infection, fever or stress. • Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, other signs and symptoms can include: Skeletal deformities, such as joint, spine or foot deformities. • Unusual facial features, such as narrow jaw or wide-set eyes. • Hearing loss. • Weakness, numbness and pain, usually in hands and feet. • Seizures. • Kidney problems. • Cognitive impairment, rarely. • Talk to your doctor if you observe any signs listed above in your child or if you have concerns about your own signs or symptoms.",
      "Causes": "Caused by any one of more than 30 identified genes, the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome depends on which gene is affected. • Congenital myasthenic syndromes are classified by which location is affected in the neuromuscular junction ― the area that provides signals (impulses) between the nerve cells and the muscle cells to trigger movement (synapses). • Disrupted signals that cause loss of muscle function can occur in different locations: Nerve cells where the impulse starts (presynaptic). • Space between your nerve and muscle cells (synaptic). • Muscle cells where the impulse is received (postsynaptic), the most common location. • Some types of congenital myasthenic syndromes are the result of congenital disorders of glycosylation. • Glycosylation is a complex chemical process that plays a role in regulating communication between cells. • Glycosylation defects can adversely affect the transmission of signals from nerve cells to muscles. • Congenital myasthenic syndromes are most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. • That means both parents must be carriers, but they do not typically show signs of the condition. • The affected child inherits two copies of the abnormal gene — one from each parent. • If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop the syndrome, but they'll be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. • Rarely, congenital myasthenic syndromes can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that only one parent passes on the affected gene. • In some cases, the affected gene occurs randomly and is not inherited. • In other cases, no gene can be identified.",
      "Risk factors": "A child is at risk of a congenital myasthenic syndrome if both parents are carriers of a gene known to cause the syndrome. • The child then inherits two copies of the gene. • Children who inherit only one copy of the gene from one parent typically won't develop the syndrome but will be carriers."

      "Overview": "Conjoined twins are two babies who are born physically connected to each other. • Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates to form two individuals. • Although two babies develop from this embryo, they remain physically connected — most often at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. • Conjoined twins may also share one or more internal body organs. • Though many conjoined twins are not alive when born (stillborn) or die shortly after birth, advances in surgery and technology have improved survival rates. • Some surviving conjoined twins can be surgically separated. • The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared. • It also depends on the experience and skill of the surgical team.",
      "Symptoms": "There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. • As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. • And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. • Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound. • Conjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. • The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. • Each pair of conjoined twins is unique. • Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites: Chest. • Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. • They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. • This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. • Abdomen. • Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. • Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. • Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). • They generally do not share a heart. • Base of spine. • Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. • Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. • A few twins share the genital and urinary organs. • Length of spine. • Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. • This type is very rare. • Pelvis. • Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. • Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. • Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. • Trunk. • Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. • The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. • Head. • Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. • Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. • But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. • Head and chest. • Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. • The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. • These twins rarely survive. • In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). • In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu).",
      "Causes": "Identical twins (monozygotic twins) occur when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into two individuals. • Eight to 12 days after conception, the embryonic layers that split to form monozygotic twins begin to develop into specific organs and structures. • It's believed that when the embryo splits later than this — usually between 13 and 15 days after conception — separation stops before the process is complete. • The resulting twins are conjoined. • An alternative theory suggests that two separate embryos may somehow fuse together in early development. • What might cause either chain of events to occur is unknown.",
      "Risk factors": "Because conjoined twins are so rare, and the cause isn't clear, it's unknown what might make some couples more likely to have conjoined twins.",
      "Complications": "Pregnancy with conjoined twins is complex and greatly increases the risk of serious complications. • Conjoined babies require surgical delivery by cesarean section (C-section). • As with twins, conjoined babies are likely to be born prematurely, and one or both could be stillborn or die shortly after birth. • Severe health issues for twins can occur immediately, such as trouble breathing or heart problems. • Later in life, health issues such as scoliosis, cerebral palsy or learning disabilities may occur. • Possible complications depend on where the twins are joined, which organs or other parts of the body they share, and the expertise and experience of the health care team. • When conjoined twins are expected, the family and the health care team need to discuss in detail the possible complications and how to prepare for them."

      "Overview": "Contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it. • The rash isn't contagious, but it can be very uncomfortable. • Many substances can cause this reaction, such as cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and plants. • The rash often shows up within days of exposure. • To treat contact dermatitis successfully, you need to identify and avoid the cause of your reaction. • If you avoid the substance causing the reaction, the rash often clears up in 2 to 4 weeks. • You can try soothing your skin with a cool, wet cloth and other self-care steps.",
      "Symptoms": "Contact dermatitis shows up on skin that has been directly exposed to the substance causing the reaction. • For example, the rash may show up along a leg that brushed against poison ivy. • The rash can develop within minutes to hours of exposure, and it can last 2 to 4 weeks. • Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis vary widely and may include: An itchy rash Leathery patches that are darker than usual (hyperpigmented), typically on brown or Black skin Dry, cracked, scaly skin, typically on white skin Bumps and blisters, sometimes with oozing and crusting Swelling, burning or tenderness See your health care provider if: The rash is so itchy that you can't sleep or go about your day The rash is severe or widespread You're worried about how your rash looks The rash doesn't get better within three weeks The rash involves the eyes, mouth, face or genitals Seek immediate medical care in the following situations: You think your skin is infected. • Clues include fever and pus oozing from blisters. • It's hard to breathe after inhaling burning weeds. • Your eyes or nasal passages hurt after inhaling smoke from burning poison ivy. • You think an ingested substance has damaged the lining of your mouth or digestive tract. • Contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. • The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. • Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time. • Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. • This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer. • Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. • Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. • And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time. • Common irritants include: Solvents Rubber gloves Bleach and detergents Hair products Soap Airborne substances Plants Fertilizers and pesticides Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. • It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. • But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis). • People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. • Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction. • Common allergens include: Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items Medications, such as antibiotic creams Balsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings Formaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products Personal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol Airborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides Products that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics Children develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on. • The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. • Examples include: Agricultural workers Cleaners Construction workers Cooks and others who work with food Florists Hair stylists and cosmetologists Health care workers, including dental workers Machinists Mechanics Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles Contact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. • This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection. • You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis: Avoid irritants and allergens. • Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. • For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold. • Wash your skin. • For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. • Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. • Rinse completely. • Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy. • Wear protective clothing or gloves. • Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers. • Apply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. • This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example. • Apply a barrier cream or gel. • These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. • For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy. • Use moisturizer. • Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple. • Take care around pets. • Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people. • Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar.",
      "Causes": "Contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to a substance that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. • The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. • Often people have irritant and allergic reactions at the same time. • Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type. • This nonallergic skin reaction occurs when an irritant damages your skin's outer protective layer. • Some people react to strong irritants after a single exposure. • Others may develop a rash after repeated exposures to even mild irritants, such as soap and water. • And some people develop a tolerance to the substance over time. • Common irritants include: Solvents Rubber gloves Bleach and detergents Hair products Soap Airborne substances Plants Fertilizers and pesticides Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you're sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. • It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen. • But it may be triggered by something that enters your body through foods, flavorings, medicine, or medical or dental procedures (systemic contact dermatitis). • People often become sensitized to allergens after many contacts with it over years. • Once you develop an allergy to a substance, even a small amount of it can cause a reaction. • Common allergens include: Nickel, which is used in jewelry, buckles and many other items Medications, such as antibiotic creams Balsam of Peru, which is used in many products, such as perfumes, toothpastes, mouth rinses and flavorings Formaldehyde, which is in preservatives, cosmetics and other products Personal care products, such as body washes, hair dyes and cosmetics Plants such as poison ivy and mango, which contain a highly allergenic substance called urushiol Airborne allergens, such as ragweed pollen and spray insecticides Products that cause a reaction when you're in the sun (photoallergic contact dermatitis), such as some sunscreens and cosmetics Children develop allergic contact dermatitis from the usual offenders and also from exposure to diapers, baby wipes, jewelry used in ear piercing, clothing with snaps or dyes, and so on.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of contact dermatitis may be higher in people who have certain jobs and hobbies. • Examples include: Agricultural workers Cleaners Construction workers Cooks and others who work with food Florists Hair stylists and cosmetologists Health care workers, including dental workers Machinists Mechanics Scuba divers or swimmers, due to the rubber in face masks or goggles",
      "Complications": "Contact dermatitis can lead to an infection if you repeatedly scratch the affected area, causing it to become wet and oozing. • This creates a good place for bacteria or fungi to grow and may cause an infection.",
      "Prevention": "You can take the following steps to help prevent contact dermatitis: Avoid irritants and allergens. • Try to identify and avoid the cause of your rash. • For ear and body piercings, use jewelry made of hypoallergenic material, such as surgical steel or gold. • Wash your skin. • For poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac, you might be able to remove most of the rash-causing substance if you wash your skin right away after coming into contact with it. • Use a mild, fragrance-free soap and warm water. • Rinse completely. • Also wash any clothing or other items that may have come into contact with a plant allergen, such as poison ivy. • Wear protective clothing or gloves. • Face masks, goggles, gloves and other protective items can shield you from irritating substances, including household cleansers. • Apply an iron-on patch to cover metal fasteners next to your skin. • This can help you avoid a reaction to jean snaps, for example. • Apply a barrier cream or gel. • These products can provide a protective layer for your skin. • For example, a nonprescription skin cream containing bentoquatam (Ivy Block) may prevent or lessen your skin's reaction to poison ivy. • Use moisturizer. • Regularly applying moisturizing lotions can help restore your skin's outermost layer and keep your skin supple. • Take care around pets. • Allergens from plants, such as poison ivy, can cling to pets and then be spread to people. • Bathe your pet if you think it got into poison ivy or something similar."

      "Overview": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by damage to the lungs. • The damage results in swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, inside the airways that limit airflow into and out of the lungs. • This limited airflow is known as obstruction. • Symptoms include trouble breathing, a daily cough that brings up mucus and a tight, whistling sound in the lungs called wheezing. • COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. • The most common cause is cigarette smoke. • Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common types of COPD. • These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among people with COPD. • Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the tubes that bring air into the lungs. • These tubes are called bronchi. • The inflammation prevents good airflow into and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus. • In emphysema, the small air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, are damaged. • The damaged alveoli can't pass enough oxygen into the bloodstream. • Although COPD is a condition that can get worse over time, COPD is treatable. • With proper management, most people with COPD can control symptoms and improve their quality of life. • Proper management also can lower the risk of other conditions linked to COPD, such as heart disease and lung cancer.",
      "Symptoms": "COPD symptoms often don't appear until a lot of lung damage has occurred. • Symptoms usually worsen over time, especially if smoking or other irritating exposure continues. • Symptoms of COPD may include: Trouble catching your breath, especially during physical activities. • Wheezing or whistling sounds when breathing. • Ongoing cough that may bring up a lot of mucus. • The mucus may be clear, white, yellow or greenish. • Chest tightness or heaviness. • Lack of energy or feeling very tired. • Frequent lung infections. • Losing weight without meaning to. • This may happen as the condition worsens. • Swelling in ankles, feet or legs. • People with COPD also are likely to have times when their symptoms become worse than the usual day-to-day variation. • This time of worsening symptoms is called an exacerbation (eg-zas-er-bay-shun). • Exacerbations can last for several days to weeks. • They can be caused by triggers such as smells, cold air, air pollution, colds or infections. • Symptoms may include: Working harder than usual to breathe or having trouble breathing. • Chest tightness. • Coughing more often. • More mucus or changes in mucus color or thickness. • Fever. • Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional if your symptoms don't get better with treatment or if symptoms get worse. • Also talk with your healthcare professional if you notice symptoms of an infection, such as fever or a change in the mucus you cough up. • In the U.S., call 911 or your local emergency number for help or go to the emergency department at a hospital right away if you can't catch your breath, your lips or fingernail beds are blue, you have a fast heartbeat, or you feel foggy and have trouble concentrating. • The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. • In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in homes that don't have good airflow. • Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace is another cause of COPD. • Not all people who have smoked for a long time have COPD symptoms, but they may still have lung damage, so their lungs don't work as well as they used to. • Some people who smoke get less common lung conditions that may be diagnosed as COPD until a more thorough exam shows a different diagnosis. • Air travels down the windpipe called the trachea and into the lungs through two large tubes called bronchi. • Inside the lungs, these tubes divide many times like the branches of a tree. • Many smaller tubes called bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli. • The alveoli have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels. • The oxygen in the air breathed in passes into these blood vessels and goes into the bloodstream. • At the same time, carbon dioxide, a gas that is a waste product from the body, passes into the alveoli and is breathed out. • When breathing out, the natural stretchiness of the alveoli forces old air out, allowing new air to get in. • This stretchiness is also called elasticity. • Long-term exposure to irritants, such as from smoking, injures the lungs. • This damage keeps air from moving in and out of the lungs freely, limiting their ability to provide oxygen to the bloodstream and take away carbon dioxide. • The two main conditions that prevent effective airflow in the lungs are: Emphysema. • This lung condition causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. • The damaged inner walls of the alveoli may be destroyed, creating one large air space that is hard to empty compared with the many healthy small ones. • The alveoli now have less surface area that can be used to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. • Also, old air gets trapped in the large alveoli so there isn't room for enough new air to get in. • Chronic bronchitis. • In this condition, the bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed. • As a result, the tubes thicken, making less room for air to pass through. • Extra mucus caused by the irritation blocks the narrowed tubes even more. • An ongoing cough results from trying to clear mucus from the airways. • In the vast majority of people with COPD in the United States, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. • But there are likely other factors at play in developing COPD because not everyone who smokes gets COPD. • One such factor may be gene changes that make some people more likely to develop the condition. • Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution, and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. • In about 1% of people with COPD, the condition results from a gene change passed down in families. • This is a genetic form of emphysema. • This gene lessens the levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the body. • AAT is made in the liver and released into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs from damage caused by smoke, fumes and dust. • Low levels of this protein, a condition called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, can cause liver damage, lung conditions such as COPD or both. • With AAT deficiency, there is usually a family history of COPD, and symptoms begin at a younger age. • Risk factors for COPD include: Tobacco smoke. • The biggest risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. • The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. • Pipe, cigar and marijuana smoking also may raise your risk. • People who breathe in large amounts of secondhand smoke are at risk of COPD too. • Asthma. • Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. • Asthma may be a risk factor for developing COPD. • The mix of asthma and smoking raises the risk of COPD even more. • Workplace exposure. • Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, smoke, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and cause swelling in the lungs. • This can raise the risk of COPD. • Fumes from burning fuel. • In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in homes with poor airflow are at higher risk of COPD. • Genetics. • AAT deficiency caused by a gene change passed down in families is the cause of COPD in some people. • This genetic form of emphysema is not common. • Other genetic factors may make certain people who smoke more likely to get COPD. • COPD can cause many complications, including: Respiratory infections. • People with COPD are more likely to have colds, the flu and pneumonia. • Any respiratory infection can make it much harder to breathe and could cause more damage to lung tissue. • Heart problems. • For reasons that aren't fully understood, COPD can raise the risk of heart disease, including heart attack. • Lung cancer. • People with COPD have a higher risk of getting lung cancer. • High blood pressure in lung arteries. • COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to the lungs. • This condition is called pulmonary hypertension. • Anxiety and depression. • Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. • And having a serious medical condition such as COPD can sometimes cause anxiety and depression. • Unlike some other medical conditions, COPD often has a clear cause and a clear way to prevent it. • Most of the time, COPD is directly linked to cigarette smoking. • The best way to prevent COPD is to never smoke. • If you smoke and have COPD, stopping now can slow how fast the condition worsens. • If you've smoked for a long time, quitting can be hard, especially if you've tried quitting once, twice or many times before. • But keep trying to quit. • It's critical to find a stop-smoking program that can help you quit for good. • It's your best chance for lessening damage to your lungs. • Talk with your healthcare professional about options that might work best for you. • Workplace exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts is another risk factor for COPD. • If you work with these types of lung irritants, talk with your supervisor about the best ways to protect yourself. • This may include wearing equipment that prevents you from breathing in these substances. • Here are some steps you can take to help prevent complications linked with COPD: Quit smoking to help lower your risk of heart disease and lung cancer. • Get an annual flu vaccination and vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia to lower your risk of or prevent some infections. • Also talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when you need the COVID-19 vaccine and the RSV vaccine. • Talk with your healthcare professional or a mental health professional if you feel sad or hopeless or think that you may have depression.",

      "Overview": "Corns and calluses are thick, hardened layers of skin that develop when the skin tries to protect itself against friction or pressure. • They often form on feet and toes or hands and fingers. • If you're healthy, you don't need treatment for corns and calluses unless they cause pain or you don't like how they look. • For most people, simply removing the source of the friction or pressure makes corns and calluses disappear.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of corns and calluses include: A thick, rough area of skin A hardened, raised bump Tenderness or pain under the skin Flaky, dry or waxy skin Corns and calluses are not the same thing. • Corns are smaller and deeper than calluses and have a hard center surrounded by swollen skin. • They can be painful when pressed. • Hard corns often form on the top of the toes or the outer edge of the small toe. • Soft corns tend to form between the toes. • Calluses are rarely painful and tend to develop on pressure spots, such as the heels, the balls of the feet, the palms and the knees. • They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns. • If a corn or callus becomes very painful or inflamed, see your health care provider. • If you have diabetes or poor blood flow, seek medical care before self-treating a corn or callus. • This is important because even a minor injury to your foot can lead to an infected open sore (ulcer). • Corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure from repeated actions. • Some sources of this friction and pressure include: Wearing ill-fitting shoes and socks. • Tight shoes and high heels can squeeze areas of the feet. • If your shoes are loose, your foot may repeatedly slide and rub against the shoe. • Your foot may also rub against a seam or stitch inside the shoe. • Socks that don't fit right can also be a problem. • Skipping socks. • Wearing shoes and sandals without socks can cause friction on your feet. • Playing instruments or using hand tools. • Calluses on the hands may result from the repeated pressure of activities such as playing instruments and using hand tools or even a pen. • Inheriting a tendency to develop corns. • The type of corn that forms on non-weight-bearing areas, such as the soles and palms (keratosis punctata), might be caused by genetics. • Risk factors for corns and calluses include: Wearing shoes that increase the pressure or friction on your feet. • Having a condition that increases the pressure or friction on your feet. • Examples are hammertoe and hallux valgus, which causes a bunion-like bulge at the base of the big toe. • Inheriting a tendency to develop corns. • The type of corn that forms on non-weight-bearing areas, such as the soles and palms (keratosis punctata), might be caused by genetics. • If you have diabetes or another condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet, you're at greater risk of complications from corns and calluses. • These approaches may help you prevent corns and calluses: Wear shoes that give your toes plenty of room. • If you can't wiggle your toes, your shoes are too tight. • Have a shoe shop stretch your shoes at any point that rubs or pinches. • Shop for shoes when your feet are most swollen, usually at the end of the day. • If you use orthotics and inserts, be sure to have them on while fitting your shoes at the store. • Use protective coverings. • Wear felt pads, nonmedicated corn pads or bandages over areas that rub against your footwear. • You can also try toe separators or some lamb's wool between your toes. • Wear padded gloves when using hand tools. • Or try padding your tool handles with cloth tape or covers.",

      "Overview": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common type of heart disease. • It affects the main blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, called the coronary arteries. • In CAD, there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. • A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls, a condition called atherosclerosis, usually causes coronary artery disease. • The buildup, called plaque, makes the arteries narrow. • Coronary artery disease often develops over many years. • Symptoms are from the lack of blood flow to the heart. • They may include chest pain and shortness of breath. • A complete blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack. • Treatment for coronary artery disease may include medicines and surgery. • Eating a nutritious diet, getting regular exercise and not smoking can help prevent coronary artery disease and the conditions that can cause it. • Coronary artery disease also may be called coronary heart disease.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of coronary artery disease happen when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. • Coronary artery disease symptoms may include: Chest pain, called angina. • You may feel squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. • It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. • The chest pain usually affects the middle or left side of the chest. • Activity or strong emotions can trigger angina. • There are different types of angina. • The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medicine makes symptoms better. • In some people, especially women, the pain may be brief or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back. • Shortness of breath. • You may feel like you can't catch your breath. • Fatigue. • If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may feel unusually tired. • Symptoms of coronary artery disease may not be noticed at first. • Sometimes symptoms only happen when the heart is beating hard, such as during exercise. • As the coronary arteries continue to narrow, symptoms can get more severe or frequent. • A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. • Common heart attack symptoms include: Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, squeezing or aching. • Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or sometimes the upper belly. • Cold sweats. • Fatigue. • Heartburn. • Nausea. • Shortness of breath. • Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness. • Chest pain is usually the most common symptom of heart attack. • But for some people, such as women, the elderly and those with diabetes, symptoms may seem unrelated to a heart attack. • For example, they may have nausea or a very brief pain in the neck or back. • Some people having a heart attack don't notice symptoms. • If you think you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. • If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. • Drive yourself only as a last option. • Smoking or having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity or a strong family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. • If you're at high risk of coronary artery disease, talk to your healthcare professional. • You may need tests to check for narrowed arteries and coronary artery disease. • Coronary artery disease is caused by the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries. • This condition is called atherosclerosis. • The buildup is called plaque. • Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. • The plaque also can burst, causing a blood clot. • Some causes of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are: Diabetes or insulin resistance. • High blood pressure. • Lack of exercise. • Smoking or tobacco use. • Coronary artery disease is common. • Coronary artery disease risk factors you can't control include: Age. • Getting older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries. • Birth sex. • Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease. • However, the risk for women increases after menopause. • Family history. • A family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. • This is especially true if a parent, brother, sister or child got heart disease at an early age. • The risk is highest if your father or a brother had heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65. • Coronary artery disease risk factors you can control are: Smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • Smoking is bad for heart health. • People who smoke have a much greater risk of heart disease. • Breathing in secondhand smoke also increases the risk. • High blood pressure. • Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries hard and stiff. • This can lead to atherosclerosis, which causes coronary artery disease. • Cholesterol. • Too much \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. \"Bad\" cholesterol is called low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. • Not enough \"good\" cholesterol, called high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also leads to atherosclerosis. • Diabetes. • Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share some risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. • Obesity. • Too much body fat is bad for overall health. • Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. • Ask your healthcare team what a healthy weight is for you. • Chronic kidney disease. • Having long-term kidney disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Not getting enough exercise. • Physical activity is important for good health. • A lack of exercise is linked to coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors. • A lot of stress. • Emotional stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease. • Unhealthy diet. • Eating foods with a lot of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase the risk of coronary artery disease. • Alcohol use. • Heavy alcohol use can lead to heart muscle damage. • It also can worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease. • Amount of sleep. • Too little sleep and too much sleep both have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. • Risk factors often happen together. • One risk factor may trigger another. • When grouped together, some risk factors make you even more likely to develop coronary artery disease. • For example, metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that includes high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much body fat around the waist and high triglyceride levels. • Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Other possible risk factors for coronary artery disease may include: Breathing pauses during sleep, called obstructive sleep apnea. • This condition causes breathing to stop and start during sleep. • It can cause sudden drops in blood oxygen levels. • The heart must work harder to pump blood. • Blood pressure goes up. • Increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). • This protein appears in higher than usual amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in the body. • High hs-CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease. • It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, the level of hs-CRP in the blood goes up. • High triglycerides. • This is a type of fat in the blood. • High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women. • High levels of homocysteine. • Homocysteine is a substance that the body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. • But high levels of homocysteine may raise the risk of coronary artery disease. • Preeclampsia. • This pregnancy complication causes high blood pressure and increased protein in the urine. • It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life. • Other pregnancy complications. • Diabetes or high blood pressure during pregnancy are known risk factors for coronary artery disease. • Certain autoimmune diseases. • People who have conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. • Complications of coronary artery disease may include: Chest pain, also called angina. • This is a symptom of coronary artery disease. • But it also can be a complication of worsening CAD. • The chest pain happens when arteries narrow and the heart doesn't get enough blood. • Heart attack. • A heart attack can happen if atherosclerosis causes a blood clot. • A clot can block blood flow. • The lack of blood can damage the heart muscle. • The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you are treated. • Heart failure.Narrowed arteries in the heart or high blood pressure can slowly make the heart weak or stiff. • This can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. • Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. • If the heart doesn't get enough blood, changes in heart signaling can happen. • This can cause irregular heartbeats.",
      "Causes": "Coronary artery disease is caused by the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the walls of the heart arteries. • This condition is called atherosclerosis. • The buildup is called plaque. • Plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. • The plaque also can burst, causing a blood clot. • Some causes of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are: Diabetes or insulin resistance. • High blood pressure. • Lack of exercise. • Smoking or tobacco use.",
      "Risk factors": "Coronary artery disease is common. • Coronary artery disease risk factors you can't control include: Age. • Getting older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries. • Birth sex. • Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease. • However, the risk for women increases after menopause. • Family history. • A family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. • This is especially true if a parent, brother, sister or child got heart disease at an early age. • The risk is highest if your father or a brother had heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65. • Coronary artery disease risk factors you can control are: Smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • Smoking is bad for heart health. • People who smoke have a much greater risk of heart disease. • Breathing in secondhand smoke also increases the risk. • High blood pressure. • Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries hard and stiff. • This can lead to atherosclerosis, which causes coronary artery disease. • Cholesterol. • Too much \"bad\" cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. \"Bad\" cholesterol is called low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. • Not enough \"good\" cholesterol, called high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also leads to atherosclerosis. • Diabetes. • Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share some risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. • Obesity. • Too much body fat is bad for overall health. • Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. • Ask your healthcare team what a healthy weight is for you. • Chronic kidney disease. • Having long-term kidney disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Not getting enough exercise. • Physical activity is important for good health. • A lack of exercise is linked to coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors. • A lot of stress. • Emotional stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease. • Unhealthy diet. • Eating foods with a lot of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase the risk of coronary artery disease. • Alcohol use. • Heavy alcohol use can lead to heart muscle damage. • It also can worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease. • Amount of sleep. • Too little sleep and too much sleep both have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. • Risk factors often happen together. • One risk factor may trigger another. • When grouped together, some risk factors make you even more likely to develop coronary artery disease. • For example, metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that includes high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much body fat around the waist and high triglyceride levels. • Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Other possible risk factors for coronary artery disease may include: Breathing pauses during sleep, called obstructive sleep apnea. • This condition causes breathing to stop and start during sleep. • It can cause sudden drops in blood oxygen levels. • The heart must work harder to pump blood. • Blood pressure goes up. • Increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). • This protein appears in higher than usual amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in the body. • High hs-CRP levels may be a risk factor for heart disease. • It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, the level of hs-CRP in the blood goes up. • High triglycerides. • This is a type of fat in the blood. • High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women. • High levels of homocysteine. • Homocysteine is a substance that the body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. • But high levels of homocysteine may raise the risk of coronary artery disease. • Preeclampsia. • This pregnancy complication causes high blood pressure and increased protein in the urine. • It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life. • Other pregnancy complications. • Diabetes or high blood pressure during pregnancy are known risk factors for coronary artery disease. • Certain autoimmune diseases. • People who have conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have an increased risk of atherosclerosis.",
      "Complications": "Complications of coronary artery disease may include: Chest pain, also called angina. • This is a symptom of coronary artery disease. • But it also can be a complication of worsening CAD. • The chest pain happens when arteries narrow and the heart doesn't get enough blood. • Heart attack. • A heart attack can happen if atherosclerosis causes a blood clot. • A clot can block blood flow. • The lack of blood can damage the heart muscle. • The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you are treated. • Heart failure.Narrowed arteries in the heart or high blood pressure can slowly make the heart weak or stiff. • This can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. • Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. • If the heart doesn't get enough blood, changes in heart signaling can happen. • This can cause irregular heartbeats."

      "Overview": "COVID-19, also called coronavirus disease 2019, is an illness caused by a virus. • The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. • It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020. • The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. • Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or mild illness. • But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions, COVID-19 can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death. • Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due to COVID-19 and death from COVID-19. • Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene. • Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. • Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.",
      "Symptoms": "Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. • Symptoms can include: Dry cough. • Shortness of breath. • Loss of taste or smell. • Extreme tiredness, called fatigue. • Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea. • Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches. • Fever or chills. • Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat. • People may only have a few symptoms or none. • People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. • For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. • People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. • Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others. • Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. • Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. • But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. • Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. • COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. • In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. • In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs. • Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital. • Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body. • Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. • The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. • When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS-C. • In adults, the name is MIS-A. • Contact a healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID-19. • If you have symptoms and need to test for COVID-19, or you've been exposed to someone with COVID-19, a healthcare professional can help. • People who are at high risk of serious illness may get medicine to block the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the body. • Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health. • Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms: Can't catch your breath or have problems breathing. • Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue. • New confusion. • Trouble staying awake or waking up. • Chest pain or pressure that is constant. • This list doesn't include every emergency symptom. • If you or a person you're taking care of has symptoms that worry you, get help. • Let the healthcare team know about a positive test for COVID-19 or symptoms of the illness. • COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2. • The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. • When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. • The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. • The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. • And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them. • It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once. • Over time, the body's defense against the COVID-19 virus can fade. • A person may be exposed to so much of the virus that it breaks through their immune defense. • As a virus infects a group of people, the virus copies itself. • During this process, the genetic code can randomly change in each copy. • The changes are called mutations. • If the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 changes in ways that make previous infections or vaccination less effective at preventing infection, people can get sick again. • The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect some pets. • Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. • It's rare for a person to get COVID-19 from a pet. • The main risk factors for COVID-19 are: If someone you live with has COVID-19. • If you spend time in places with poor air flow and a higher number of people when the virus is spreading. • If you spend more than 30 minutes in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. • Many factors affect your risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19. • How long you are in contact, if the space has good air flow and your activities all affect the risk. • Also, if you or others wear masks, if someone has COVID-19 symptoms and how close you are affects your risk. • Close contact includes sitting and talking next to one another, for example, or sharing a car or bedroom. • It seems to be rare for people to catch the virus that causes COVID-19 from an infected surface. • While the virus is shed in waste, called stool, COVID-19 infection from places such as a public bathroom is not common. • Some people are at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness than others. • This includes people age 65 and older as well as babies younger than 6 months. • Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care for COVID-19. • Not every risk factor for serious COVID-19 illness is known. • People of all ages who have no other medical issues have needed hospital care for COVID-19. • Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. • Serious illness also is a higher risk for people who have: Sickle cell disease or thalassemia. • Serious heart diseases and possibly high blood pressure. • Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases. • People with dementia or Alzheimer's also are at higher risk, as are people with brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke. • Smoking increases the risk of serious COVID-19 illness. • And people with a body mass index in the overweight category or obese category may have a higher risk as well. • Other medical conditions that may raise the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 include: Cancer or a history of cancer. • Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. • Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, or HIV. • Pregnancy. • This list is not complete. • Factors linked to a health issue may raise the risk of serious COVID-19 illness too. • Examples are a medical condition where people live in a group home, or lack of access to medical care. • Also, people with more than one health issue, or people of older age who also have health issues have a higher chance of severe illness. • Complications of COVID-19 include long-term loss of taste and smell, skin rashes, and sores. • The illness can cause trouble breathing or pneumonia. • Medical issues a person already manages may get worse. • Complications of severe COVID-19 illness can include: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the body's organs do not get enough oxygen. • Shock caused by the infection or heart problems. • Overreaction of the immune system, called the inflammatory response. • Blood clots. • Kidney injury. • After a COVID-19 infection, some people report that symptoms continue for months, or they develop new symptoms. • This syndrome has often been called long COVID, or post-COVID-19. • You might hear it called long haul COVID-19, post-COVID conditions or PASC. • That's short for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. • Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long-term illness. • But the virus that causes COVID-19 has only been studied since it began to spread in 2019. • So, research into the specific effects of long-term COVID-19 symptoms continues. • Researchers do think that post-COVID-19 syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity. • Getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help prevent post-COVID-19 syndrome. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. • The COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19. • The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2024-2025 formula. • This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. • Among people with a typical immune system: Children ages 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after three doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. • If a child has had one dose of a previous Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine, two doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine will bring the child up to date. • If a child had two doses previously, one dose of the 2024-2025 formula will bring the child up to date. • People age 5 and older are up to date with one 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. • Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 2024-2025 formula. • This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. • Among people with a typical immune system: Children ages 6 months up to age 4 are up to date if they've had two doses of a 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. • If a child has had previous Moderna COVID vaccines, one dose of the 2024-2025 vaccine will bring the child up to date. • People age 5 and older are up to date with one 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. • Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, adjuvanted 2024-2025 formula. • This vaccine is available for people age 12 years and older. • Among people with a typical immune system: People age 12 years and older are up to date if they've had one dose of a 2024-2025 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. • In general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine approved or authorized for their age. • They usually don't need to get the same vaccine each time. • Some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including: Children ages 6 months to 4 years. • People age 5 years and older with weakened immune systems. • People age 12 and older who have had one shot of the Novavax vaccine should get the second Novavax shot in the two-dose series. • Talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions about the vaccines for you or your child. • Your healthcare team can help you if: The vaccine you or your child got earlier isn't available. • You don't know which vaccine you or your child received. • You or your child started a vaccine series but couldn't finish it due to side effects. • People with weakened immune systems Your healthcare team may suggest added doses of COVID-19 vaccine if you have a moderately or seriously weakened immune system. • The FDA has also authorized the monoclonal antibody pemivibart (Pemgarda) to prevent COVID-19 in some people with weakened immune systems. • Control the spread of infection In addition to vaccination, there are other ways to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. • If you are at a higher risk of serious illness, talk to your healthcare professional about how best to protect yourself. • Know what to do if you get sick so you can quickly start treatment. • If you feel ill or have COVID-19, stay home and away from others, including pets, if possible. • Avoid sharing household items such as dishes or towels if you're sick. • In general, make it a habit to: Test for COVID-19. • If you have symptoms of COVID-19 test for the infection. • Or test five days after you came in contact with the virus. • Help from afar. • Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms, if possible. • Wash your hands. • Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. • Cover your coughs and sneezes. • Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. • Then wash your hands. • Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces. • For example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly. • Try to spread out in crowded public areas, especially in places with poor airflow. • This is important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. • The CDC recommends that people wear a mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital. • They suggest wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, that fits well and is comfortable. • Travel brings people together from areas where illnesses may be at higher levels. • Masks can help slow the spread of respiratory diseases in general, including COVID-19. • Masks help the most in places with low air flow and where you are in close contact with other people. • Also, masks can help if the places you travel to or through have a high level of illness. • Masking is especially important if you or a companion have a high risk of serious illness from COVID-19.",

      "Overview": "Cradle cap causes crusty or oily scaly patches on a baby's scalp. • The condition isn't painful or itchy. • But it can cause thick white or yellow scales that aren't easy to remove. • Cradle cap usually clears up on its own in weeks or a few months. • Home care measures include washing your baby's scalp daily with a mild shampoo. • This can help you loosen and remove the scales. • Don't scratch cradle cap. • If cradle cap doesn't stop or seems serious, your baby's doctor or other health care professional may suggest a medicated shampoo, lotion or other treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms of cradle cap include: Patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp. • Oily or dry skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales. • Skin flakes. • Mild inflammation. • Similar scales also may be present on the ears, eyelids, nose and groin. • Cradle cap is common in newborns. • It usually isn't itchy. • Cradle cap is the common term for infantile seborrheic dermatitis. • It's sometimes confused with another skin condition, atopic dermatitis. • A major difference between these conditions is that atopic dermatitis can be very itchy. • See your baby's doctor or other health care professional if: You've tried treating cradle cap at home without success. • The patches spread to your baby's face or body.",
      "Causes": "The cause of cradle cap isn't known. • One factor may be hormones that pass from the mother to the baby before birth. • These hormones can cause oil glands and hair follicles to make too much oil. • This oil is called sebum. • Another factor may be a fungus called malassezia (mal-uh-SEE-zhuh) that grows in the sebum along with bacteria. • Antifungal treatments often help control symptoms. • This supports the idea that malassezia is a cause. • An example of an antifungal treatment is ketoconazole. • Cradle cap isn't contagious, and it's not caused by poor hygiene.",
      "Risk factors": "Cradle cap is very common in babies. • There are no known risk factors for it.",
      "Prevention": "Shampooing your baby's hair every few days can help prevent cradle cap. • Use a baby shampoo unless your baby's doctor or other health care professional suggests a stronger product."

      "Overview": "Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a disorder present at birth in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of your baby's skull (cranial sutures) close prematurely (fuse), before your baby's brain is fully formed. • Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance. • Usually, during infancy the sutures remain flexible, allowing a baby's skull to expand as the brain grows. • In the front of the skull, the sutures meet in the large soft spot (fontanel) on top of the head. • The anterior fontanel is the soft spot felt just behind a baby's forehead. • The next largest fontanel is at the back (posterior). • Each side of the skull has a tiny fontanel. • Craniosynostosis usually involves premature fusion of a single cranial suture, but it can involve more than one of the sutures in a baby's skull (multiple suture craniosynostosis). • In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis). • Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for brain growth. • Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby's brain adequate space to grow and develop. • Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children develop as expected in their ability to think and reason (cognitive development) and have good cosmetic results after surgery. • Early diagnosis and treatment are key.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. • Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. • Signs and symptoms can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical There are several types of craniosynostosis. • Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. • Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. • Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. • The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. • Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). • Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. • This head shape is called scaphocephaly. • Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. • Coronal. • Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. • It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. • When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. • Metopic. • The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. • Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. • This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. • Lambdoid. • Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. • It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. • A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. • For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. • This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance. • Your health care provider will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. • Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape.",
      "Causes": "Often the cause of craniosynostosis is not known, but sometimes it's related to genetic disorders. • Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. • Its cause is unknown, although it's thought to be a combination of genes and environmental factors. • Syndromic craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes, such as Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which can affect a baby's skull development. • These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems.",
      "Complications": "If untreated, craniosynostosis may cause, for example: Permanently misshapen head and face Poor self-esteem and social isolation The risk of increased pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure) from simple craniosynostosis is small if the suture and head shape are fixed surgically. • But babies with an underlying syndrome may develop increased intracranial pressure if their skulls don't expand enough to make room for their growing brains. • If untreated, increased intracranial pressure can cause: Developmental delays Cognitive impairment Blindness Seizures Headaches"

      "Overview": "Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes swelling and irritation of the tissues, called inflammation, in the digestive tract. • This can lead to belly pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. • Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can affect different areas of the digestive tract in different people. • Crohn's most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. • The inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel. • Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating. • Sometimes, it may lead to serious or life-threatening complications. • There's no known cure for Crohn's disease, but therapies can greatly reduce its symptoms and even bring about long-term remission and healing of inflammation. • With treatment, many people with Crohn's disease can function well.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Crohn's disease typically include: Diarrhea. • Fever. • Fatigue. • Belly pain and cramping. • Blood in the stool. • Mouth sores. • Reduced appetite and weight loss. • Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin, called a fistula. • Crohn's disease can affect any part of the small or large intestine. • It may involve multiple segments, or it may be continuous. • It most commonly involves the last part of the small intestine. • In some people, the disease is only in the colon or the large intestine. • Symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. • They usually develop gradually, but sometimes might come on suddenly, without warning. • Someone with Crohn's disease also may have periods of time with no symptoms. • This is known as remission. • People with severe Crohn's disease also may experience symptoms outside of the intestinal tract, including: Inflammation of skin, eyes and joints. • Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts. • Kidney stones. • Iron deficiency, called anemia. • Delayed growth or sexual development, in children. • See a healthcare professional if you have ongoing changes in your bowel habits or if you have any symptoms of Crohn's disease, such as: Belly pain. • Blood in the stool. • Nausea and vomiting. • Diarrhea lasting more than two weeks. • Losing weight without trying. • Fever in addition to any of the above symptoms. • The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown. • Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now healthcare professionals know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. • Several factors likely play a role in its development. • Genes. • More than 200 genes have been associated with Crohn's disease. • However, researchers aren't exactly sure what role they play in the condition. • Having one or more of these genes may make someone more likely to get Crohn's disease. • Immune system. • It's possible that bacteria, viruses or other environmental factors may trigger Crohn's disease. • For example, certain bacteria in the gut microbiome are suspected to be associated with Crohn's disease, but it is unknown if these bacteria cause Crohn's disease. • When the immune system tries to fight off an invading microorganism or environmental triggers, an atypical immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too. • Risk factors for Crohn's disease may include: Family history. • People with a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, are at higher risk to have the disease. • As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease. • Age. • Crohn's disease can happen at any age, but it's more common to develop the condition when you're young. • Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old. • Ethnicity. • Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, white people have the highest risk, especially people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. • However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among Black people who live in North America and the United Kingdom. • Crohn's disease also is being increasingly seen in the Middle Eastern population and among migrants to the United States. • Cigarette smoking. • Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. • Smoking also leads to more-serious disease and a greater risk of having surgery. • If you smoke, it's important to stop. • Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. • These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. • While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse. • Crohn's disease may lead to one or more of the following complications: Bowel blockage or obstruction. • Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. • Over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents, often known as a stricture. • Surgery to widen the stricture or to remove the diseased portion of the bowel may be necessary. • Ulcers. • Ongoing inflammation can lead to open sores called ulcers anywhere in the digestive tract. • This can include the mouth, anus and genital area. • Fistulas. • Sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a connection between different body parts that shouldn't be there. • This is known as a fistula. • Fistulas can develop between the intestine and the skin, or between the intestine and another organ. • Fistulas near or around the anal area are the most common kind. • When fistulas develop inside the abdomen, it may lead to infections and collections of pus called abscesses. • This can be life-threatening if not treated. • Fistulas may form between loops of bowel, in the bladder or vagina, or through the skin, causing continuous drainage of bowel contents to the skin. • Anal fissure. • This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. • It's often associated with painful stool and may lead to a fistula. • Malnutrition. • Diarrhea, belly pain and cramping may make it difficult to eat or for the intestine to absorb enough nutrients. • It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease. • Colon cancer. • Having Crohn's disease that affects the colon increases the risk of colon cancer. • General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without Crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy at least every 10 years beginning at age 45. • In people with Crohn's disease affecting a large part of the colon, a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer is recommended about eight years after disease onset and generally is performed every 1 to 2 years afterward. • Ask a healthcare professional whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently. • Skin disorders. • Many people with Crohn's disease also may develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. • This skin disorder involves deep nodules, tunnels and abscesses in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in the perianal or genital area. • Some Crohn's disease treatments also increase the risk of skin cancers, so a routine skin examination is recommended. • Other health problems. • Crohn's disease also can cause problems in other parts of the body. • Among these problems are low iron, called anemia, osteoporosis, arthritis, kidney stones, eye problems, and gallbladder or liver disease. • Medicine risks. • Certain Crohn's disease medicines that block functions of the immune system are associated with a small risk of developing cancers, including lymphoma and skin cancers. • They also increase the risk of infections. • Corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and high blood pressure, among other conditions. • Work with a healthcare professional to determine risks and benefits of medicines. • Blood clots. • Crohn's disease increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries.",

      "Overview": "Cryoglobulinemia is a family of rare conditions, called vasculitis. • Vasculitis causes irritation and swelling, called inflammation, of the blood vessels. • Cryoglobulins are atypical proteins in the blood. • For people who have cryoglobulinemia (kry-o-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh), these proteins may clump together at body temperatures below 98.6 F (37 C). • These clumps can block blood flow. • This can damage the skin, joints, nerves and organs, mainly the kidneys and liver.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people have no symptoms of cryoglobulinemia. • For people who have symptoms, the symptoms might come and go. • They can include: Skin spots. • Most people with cryoglobulinemia get purple skin spots, called lesions, on their legs. • On Black or brown skin, the spots might look black or brown. • Some people also get open leg sores, called ulcers. • Joint pain. • Symptoms like those of rheumatoid arthritis are common in cryoglobulinemia. • Peripheral neuropathy. • Cryoglobulinemia can damage the nerves at the tips of the fingers and toes. • This causes numbness and other problems.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes cryoglobulinemia. • It's been linked to: Infections. • Hepatitis C is the most common infection linked to cryoglobulinemia. • Others include hepatitis B, HIV, Epstein-Barr, toxoplasmosis and malaria. • Certain cancers. • Some cancers of the blood, such as multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, can cause cryoglobulinemia. • Autoimmune diseases. • Disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues by mistake, called autoimmune, increases the risk of getting cryoglobulinemia. • Examples are lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors of cryoglobulinemia may include: Sex. • Cryoglobulinemia happens more often in women than in men. • Age. • Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia most often begin in middle age. • Other diseases. • Cryoglobulinemia is linked with diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, lupus and Sjogren syndrome.",

      "Overview": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounds the brain and spinal cord and provides a cushion to protect them from injury. • There are three layers that surround the spinal cord and brain. • When there is a hole or tear in the outermost layer, a CSF leak occurs. • The hole or tear in this outer layer, called the dura mater, allows some of the fluid to escape. • There are two distinct types of CSF leaks: spinal CSF leaks and cranial CSF leaks. • Each type has different symptoms, causes and treatments. • A spinal CSF leak occurs anywhere in the spinal column. • The most common symptom of a spinal CSF leak is a headache. • A cranial CSF leak occurs in the skull, and often causes symptoms such as clear fluid leaking from the nose or ear. • Some CSF leaks may heal with bed rest and other conservative treatment. • Many CSF leaks need a patch to cover the hole or surgery to repair the leak.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary between spinal and cranial CSF leaks. • The most common symptom of a spinal CSF leak is a headache. • These headaches usually: Cause pain in the back of the head. • Improve when lying down. • Worsen when standing up. • May start or worsen when coughing or straining. • Rarely, start suddenly. • When this happens, it is called a \"thunderclap\" headache. • Other symptoms of spinal CSF leaks may include: Neck or shoulder pain. • Ringing in the ears. • Changes in hearing. • Dizziness. • Nausea or vomiting. • Changes in vision. • Changes in behavior or ability to think clearly. • Cranial CSF leak symptoms may include: Clear, watery drainage from one side of the nose or ear. • Hearing loss. • A metallic taste in the mouth. • Meningitis.",
      "Causes": "Spinal CSF leaks may be caused by: A spinal tap, also called a lumbar puncture. • An epidural in the spine for pain relief, such as during labor and delivery. • An injury to the head or spine. • Bone spurs along the spine. • Irregularities of the dura mater around the nerve roots in the spine. • Irregular connections between dura mater and veins. • These are referred to as CSF-venous fistulas. • Prior surgery on the spine. • Cranial CSF leaks may be caused by: A head injury. • Sinus surgery. • Increased pressure in the brain. • Malformations of the inner ear. • Sometimes CSF leaks develop after very minor events: Sneezing. • Coughing. • Straining to have a bowel movement. • Lifting heavy objects. • Falling. • Stretching. • Exercise. • When there is no surgery or procedure prior to the start of a CSF leak, it is called a spontaneous CSF leak.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for spinal CSF leaks include: Having a previous surgery or procedure on or around the spine. • Connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which often also cause joint hypermobility and dislocations. • Risk factors for cranial CSF leaks include: Having a previous surgery on or around the skull. • Obesity. • Obstructive sleep apnea. • Head trauma. • Tumor at the skull base. • Irregularities of the skull base or inner ear.",
      "Complications": "If a cranial CSF leak is left untreated, complications may occur. • Possible complications include meningitis and tension pneumocephalus, which is when air enters the spaces surrounding the brain. • Untreated spinal CSF leaks may lead to subdural hematomas, or bleeding on the surface of the brain."

      "Overview": "Cushing syndrome happens when the body has too much of the hormone cortisol for a long time. • This can result from the body making too much cortisol, or from taking medicines called glucocorticoids, which affect the body the same way as cortisol. • Too much cortisol can cause some of the main symptoms of Cushing syndrome — a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. • Cushing syndrome also can cause high blood pressure or bone loss. • Sometimes, it can cause type 2 diabetes. • Treatments for Cushing syndrome can lower the body's cortisol levels and improve symptoms. • The sooner treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Cushing syndrome can vary depending on the level of extra cortisol. • Weight gain in the trunk, with thin arms and legs. • Weight gain in the face. • This is sometimes called moon face. • A fatty lump between the shoulders. • This may be referred to as a buffalo hump. • Pink or purple stretch marks on the stomach, hips, thighs, breasts and underarms. • Thin, frail skin that bruises easily. • Slow wound healing. • Acne. • Thick, dark hair on the face and body. • This condition is called hirsutism. • Periods that are irregular or that stop. • Lower sex drive. • Reduced fertility. • Problems getting an erection. • Extreme tiredness. • Muscle weakness. • Depression, anxiety and irritability. • Emotions that are hard to control. • Trouble concentrating or remembering. • Sleeplessness. • High blood pressure. • Headache. • Infections. • Skin darkening. • Bone loss, which can lead to broken bones. • Stunted growth in children. • Call your health care provider if you have symptoms of Cushing syndrome, especially if you're taking glucocorticoid medicine to treat a health issue such as asthma, arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. • Cushing syndrome is caused by having too much cortisol in the body. • Cortisol is a hormone that is made in the adrenal glands. • It helps the body respond to stress and plays many other important roles, including: Controlling blood pressure. • Reducing inflammation. • Helping the heart and blood vessels work correctly. • Controlling blood sugar. • Helping the body use food for energy. • Cushing syndrome can happen from taking glucocorticoid medicines. • These are often used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and asthma. • Pain or injury in the back or joints and many skin rashes may be treated with glucocorticoids. • They also may be used to stop the body from rejecting a new organ after a transplant. • Glucocorticoids may be taken by mouth, given as a shot, rubbed into the skin or breathed into the lungs by an inhaler. • Any form of glucocorticoid, if taken in large amounts for a long time, can cause Cushing syndrome. • A hormone made in the pituitary gland controls how much cortisol the body makes. • This is called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). • Some tumors make ACTH, which creates more cortisol and can cause Cushing syndrome. • Problems with the adrenal glands also can affect cortisol and cause Cushing syndrome. • When Cushing syndrome happens this way, it may be caused by: ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma. • Pituitary adenomas are tumors that grow in the pituitary gland. • They are found at the base of the brain and are usually not cancer. • These tumors sometimes make too much ACTH. • This causes the adrenal glands to make extra cortisol. • When Cushing syndrome happens this way, it's called Cushing disease. • It happens more often in women and is the most common type of endogenous Cushing syndrome. • Ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. • Rarely, a tumor that makes too much ACTH grows in an organ that usually doesn't make ACTH. • This is called ectopic ACTH production. • It causes the body to make too much cortisol. • These tumors can be cancerous, but aren't always. • They are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland. • Adrenal gland tumors or disease. • Problems with the adrenal glands can cause them to make too much cortisol. • The most common is a tumor in the outer part of the adrenal gland called an adrenal adenoma. • These tumors are not cancer, and only some make too much cortisol. • Cancerous tumors in the outer part of the adrenal glands, known as adrenocortical carcinoma, are rare. • But they can make cortisol and cause Cushing syndrome. • Sometimes, several lumps that make cortisol can grow in the adrenal glands and cause Cushing syndrome. • This is called adrenal nodular hyperplasia. • Familial Cushing syndrome. • Rarely, people inherit a tendency to get tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, which are glands that make hormones. • If these tumors make ACTH or cortisol, Cushing syndrome can happen. • Without treatment, Cushing syndrome can cause complications, including: Bone loss, also called osteoporosis, which can lead to broken bones. • High blood pressure, also called hypertension. • Type 2 diabetes. • Serious or multiple infections. • Loss of muscle mass and strength.",

      "Overview": "Cyclothymia (sy-kloe-THIE-me-uh), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder. • Cyclothymia causes emotional ups and downs, but they're not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder. • With cyclothymia, you experience periods when your mood noticeably shifts up and down from your baseline. • You may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when you feel somewhat down. • Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine. • Although the highs and lows of cyclothymia are less extreme than those of bipolar disorder, it's critical to seek help managing these symptoms because they can interfere with your ability to function and increase your risk of bipolar I or II disorder. • Treatment options for cyclothymia include talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications and close, ongoing follow-up with your doctor.",
      "Symptoms": "Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. • The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). • The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. • Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. • When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. • The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel. • Signs and symptoms of the highs of cyclothymia may include: An exaggerated feeling of happiness or well-being (euphoria) Extreme optimism Inflated self-esteem Talking more than usual Poor judgment that can result in risky behavior or unwise choices Racing thoughts Irritable or agitated behavior Excessive physical activity Increased drive to perform or achieve goals (sexual, work related or social) Decreased need for sleep Tendency to be easily distracted Inability to concentrate Signs and symptoms of the lows of cyclothymia may include: Feeling sad, hopeless or empty Tearfulness Irritability, especially in children and teenagers Loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable Changes in weight Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Sleep problems Restlessness Fatigue or feeling slowed down Problems concentrating Thinking of death or suicide If you have any symptoms of cyclothymia, seek medical help as soon as possible. • Cyclothymia generally doesn't get better on its own. • If you're reluctant to seek treatment, work up the courage to confide in someone who can help you take that first step. • If a loved one has symptoms of cyclothymia, talk openly and honestly with that person about your concerns. • You can't force someone to seek professional help, but you can offer support and help find a qualified doctor or mental health provider. • Although suicidal thoughts might occur with cyclothymia, they're more likely to occur if you have bipolar I or II disorder. • If you're considering suicide right now: Call 911 or your local emergency services number, or go to a hospital emergency department. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • If you just can't make that call, reach out to someone else — immediately — such as your doctor, mental health provider, family member, friend or someone in your faith community.",
      "Causes": "It's not known specifically what causes cyclothymia. • As with many mental health disorders, research shows that it may result from a combination of: Genetics, as cyclothymia tends to run in families Differences in the way the brain works, such as changes in the brain's neurobiology Environmental issues, such as traumatic experiences or prolonged periods of stress",
      "Risk factors": "Cyclothymia is thought to be relatively rare. • But true estimates are hard to make because people may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as having other mood disorders, such as depression. • Cyclothymia typically starts during the teenage years or young adulthood. • It affects about the same number of males and females.",
      "Complications": "If you have cyclothymia: Not treating it can result in significant emotional problems that affect every area of your life There is a high risk of later developing bipolar I or II disorder Substance misuse is common You may also have an anxiety disorder You may be at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide",
      "Prevention": "There's no sure way to prevent cyclothymia. • However, treatment at the earliest indication of a mental health disorder can help prevent cyclothymia from worsening. • Long-term preventive treatment also can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of hypomania, mania or major depression."

      "Overview": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a condition passed down in families that causes damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. • CF affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. • These fluids, also called secretions, are usually thin and slippery to protect the body's internal tubes and ducts and make them smooth pathways. • But in people with CF, a changed gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. • The secretions plug up pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. • CF gets worse over time and needs daily care, but people with CF usually can attend school and work. • They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in past decades. • Better screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 50s or longer, and some are being diagnosed later in life.",
      "Symptoms": "In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. • But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up. • CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. • Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. • Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. • People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren't typical. • These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia. • People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. • Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. • Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. • In cystic fibrosis, the lungs are most commonly affected. • The thick and sticky mucus that happens with CF clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. • This can cause symptoms such as: A cough that won't go away and brings up thick mucus. • A squeaking sound when breathing called wheezing. • Limited ability to do physical activity before tiring. • Repeated lung infections. • Irritated and swollen nasal passages or a stuffy nose. • Repeated sinus infections. • The thick mucus caused by cystic fibrosis can block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine. • Without these digestive enzymes, the intestines can't completely take in and use the nutrients in food. • The result is often: Foul-smelling, greasy stools. • Poor weight gain and growth. • Blocked intestines, which is more likely to happen in newborns. • Ongoing or severe constipation. • Straining often while trying to pass stool can cause part of the rectum to stick out of the anus. • This is called a rectal prolapse. • If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis — or if someone in your family has CF — talk with your healthcare professional about testing for the condition. • Make an appointment with a doctor who has skills and experience in treating CF. • CF requires regular follow-up with your healthcare professional, at least every three months. • Call your healthcare professional if you have new or worsening symptoms, such as more mucus than usual or a change in the mucus color, lack of energy, weight loss, or severe constipation. • Get medical care right away if you're coughing up blood, have chest pain or trouble breathing, or have severe stomach pain and bloating. • Call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the emergency department at a hospital if: You're having a hard time catching your breath or talking. • Your lips or fingernails turn blue or gray. • Others notice that you're not mentally alert. • In cystic fibrosis, a change in a gene causes problems with the protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. • This gene is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. • It affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. • When the CFTR protein doesn't work as it should, the result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as extra salt in sweat. • Changes in the CFTR gene that cause CF are divided into several different groups based on the problems they cause. • Different groups of gene changes affect how much CFTR protein is made and how well it works. • To have cystic fibrosis, children must get one copy of the changed CFTR gene from each parent. • If children get only one copy, they won't develop CF. • But they will be carriers and could pass the changed gene to their own children. • People who are carriers may have no symptoms of CF or a few mild symptoms. • Because cystic fibrosis is a condition passed down in families, family history is a risk factor. • CF occurs in all races, but it's most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. • Because it's less common in people who are Black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Native American or Asian, this might lead to a much later diagnosis. • A late diagnosis may cause worse health issues. • Early and effective treatment can improve your quality of life, prevent complications and help you live longer. • If you're a person of color and have symptoms that could be CF, talk to your healthcare professional so that you can get tested for CF. • Complications of cystic fibrosis can affect the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as other organs. • Damaged airways. • Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of damaged airways, a long-term lung condition called bronchiectasis. • Bronchiectasis results in widening and scarring of the airways. • This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways. • Ongoing infections. • Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses makes a place for bacteria and fungi to live and grow. • Sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia are common and may happen repeatedly. • Infections with bacteria that don't respond to antibiotics and are difficult to treat is common too. • Growths in the nose. • Because the lining inside the nose is irritated and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths called nasal polyps. • Coughing up blood. • Bronchiectasis can occur next to blood vessels in the lungs. • The combination of airway damage and infection can result in coughing up blood. • Often this is only a small amount of blood, but rarely it can be life-threatening. • Collapsed lung. • Also called pneumothorax, this condition happens when air leaks into the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall. • This causes part or all of a lung to collapse. • Collapsed lung is more common in adults with CF. • Collapsed lung can cause sudden chest pain and trouble breathing. • People often have a bubbling feeling in the chest. • Respiratory failure. • Over time, CF can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. • Lung function usually worsens slowly over time and can become life-threatening. • Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death with CF. • Bouts of worsening symptoms. • People with CF may experience times when respiratory symptoms are worse than usual. • These are called exacerbations (eg-zas-er-bay-shuns). • Symptoms may include coughing with more mucus than usual and trouble breathing. • Low energy and weight loss also are common during exacerbations. • Exacerbations are treated with antibiotics. • Sometimes treatment can be given at home, but a stay in the hospital may be needed. • Poor nutrition. • Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the intestines. • Without these enzymes, the body can't take in and use protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins and can't get enough nutrients. • This can result in delayed growth and weight loss. • An inflamed pancreas, a condition called pancreatitis, is common. • Diabetes. • The pancreas makes insulin, which the body needs to use sugar. • Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of diabetes. • About 20% of teenagers and up to 50% of adults with CF develop diabetes. • Liver disease. • The tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine may become blocked and inflamed. • This can lead to liver problems, such as jaundice, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis, and sometimes gallstones. • Intestinal obstruction. • Intestinal blockage can happen to people with CF at all ages. • Sometimes, a condition in which a section of the intestine slides inside another nearby section of the intestine, like a collapsible telescope, also can happen. • Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). • DIOS is partial or complete blockage where the small intestine meets the large intestine. • DIOS requires treatment right away. • Infertility in men. • Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are not fertile. • The tube that connects the testicles and prostate gland, called the vas deferens, is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. • Sperm is still made in the testicles even though it can't pass into the semen made by the prostate gland. • Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with CF to become biological parents. • Lower fertility in women. • Although women with CF may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. • Still, pregnancy can worsen the symptoms of CF. • Talk with your healthcare professional about the risks. • Thinning of the bones. • Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones called osteoporosis. • Joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain also may occur. • Out of balance electrolytes and dehydration. • CF causes saltier sweat, so the balance of minerals in the blood may be upset. • This raises the risk for dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather. • Symptoms of dehydration include a fast heartbeat, extreme tiredness, weakness and low blood pressure. • Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). • Stomach acid repeatedly flows back up into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. • This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus. • Mental health conditions. • Having an ongoing medical condition that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety. • Higher risk of digestive tract cancer. • The risk of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel, liver, and pancreas is higher in people with cystic fibrosis. • Regular colorectal cancer screening should begin at age 40. • If you or your partner have close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may choose to have genetic testing before having children. • Testing done in a lab on a sample of blood can help find out your risk of having a child with CF. • If you're already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of CF, your healthcare professional can do other tests on your unborn child. • Genetic testing isn't for everyone. • Before you decide to be tested, talk with a genetic counselor about the mental health impact the test results might have.",

protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins and can't get enough nutrients. • This can result in delayed growth and weight loss. • An inflamed pancreas, a condition called pancreatitis, is common. • Diabetes. • The pancreas makes insulin, which the body needs to use sugar. • Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of diabetes. • About 20% of teenagers and up to 50% of adults with CF develop diabetes. • Liver disease. • The tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine may become blocked and inflamed. • This can lead to liver problems, such as jaundice, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis, and sometimes gallstones. • Intestinal obstruction. • Intestinal blockage can happen to people with CF at all ages. • Sometimes, a condition in which a section of the intestine slides inside another nearby section of the intestine, like a collapsible telescope, also can happen. • Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). • DIOS is partial or complete blockage where the small intestine meets the large intestine. • DIOS requires treatment right away. • Infertility in men. • Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are not fertile. • The tube that connects the testicles and prostate gland, called the vas deferens, is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. • Sperm is still made in the testicles even though it can't pass into the semen made by the prostate gland. • Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with CF to become biological parents. • Lower fertility in women. • Although women with CF may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. • Still, pregnancy can worsen the symptoms of CF. • Talk with your healthcare professional about the risks. • Thinning of the bones. • Cystic fibrosis raises the risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones called osteoporosis. • Joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain also may occur. • Out of balance electrolytes and dehydration. • CF causes saltier sweat, so the balance of minerals in the blood may be upset. • This raises the risk for dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather. • Symptoms of dehydration include a fast heartbeat, extreme tiredness, weakness and low blood pressure. • Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). • Stomach acid repeatedly flows back up into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, called the esophagus. • This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus. • Mental health conditions. • Having an ongoing medical condition that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety. • Higher risk of digestive tract cancer. • The risk of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel, liver, and pancreas is higher in people with cystic fibrosis. • Regular colorectal cancer screening should begin at age 40.",
      "Prevention": "If you or your partner have close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may choose to have genetic testing before having children. • Testing done in a lab on a sample of blood can help find out your risk of having a child with CF. • If you're already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of CF, your healthcare professional can do other tests on your unborn child. • Genetic testing isn't for everyone. • Before you decide to be tested, talk with a genetic counselor about the mental health impact the test results might have."

      "Overview": "Cystitis (sis-TIE-tis) is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. • Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot. • It can also be painful. • Most of the time, cystitis happens when there's an infection caused by bacteria. • This is called a urinary tract infection (UTI). • Having a bladder infection can be painful and annoying. • It can become a serious health problem if the infection spreads to your kidneys. • Cystitis also may occur as a reaction to certain drugs or radiation therapy. • Things that sometimes irritate the bladder, such as hygiene products, spermicide jelly or long-term catheter use, can also lead to cystitis. • Cystitis can also happen as a complication of another illness. • The usual treatment for cystitis caused by bacteria is to take antibiotic medication. • Treatment for other types of cystitis depends on the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "Cystitis signs and symptoms may include: A strong, persistent urge to urinate Pain or a burning feeling when urinating Passing frequent, small amounts of urine Blood in the urine (hematuria) Passing cloudy or strong-smelling urine Pelvic discomfort A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button (abdomen) Low-grade fever In young children, new episodes of accidental daytime wetting also may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). • Nighttime bed-wetting on its own isn't likely to happen because of a UTI. • Get medical help right away if you have signs and symptoms common to a kidney infection. • These include: Back or side pain Fever and chills Nausea and vomiting If you develop urgent, frequent or painful urination that lasts for several hours or longer or if you notice blood in your urine, call your health care provider. • If you've been diagnosed with a UTI in the past and you develop symptoms that mimic a previous UTI, call your provider. • Also call your provider if cystitis symptoms come back after you're done with antibiotic treatment. • You may need to try a different type of medicine. • If your child starts having daytime wetting accidents, call your child's health care provider. • In otherwise healthy men, cystitis is rare. • Any symptoms should be checked by a health care provider. • Your urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. • All play a role in removing waste from your body. • Your kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located toward the back of your upper abdomen. • They filter waste from your blood and regulate the concentrations of many substances. • Tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. • The bladder stores the urine until you feel the need to urinate. • Urine then leaves your body through the urethra. • UTIs typically occur when bacteria outside the body enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply. • Most cases of cystitis are caused by a type of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. • But other types of bacteria can cause infections, too. • Bacterial bladder infections may happen in women after sex. • Even in those who aren't sexually active, UTIs can happen because the female genital area often harbors bacteria that can cause cystitis. • Although bacterial infections are the most common cause of cystitis, a number of noninfectious factors also may cause the bladder to become inflamed. • Some examples include: Interstitial cystitis. • The cause of this chronic bladder inflammation, also called painful bladder syndrome, is not clear. • Most cases happen in women. • The condition can be difficult to diagnose and treat. • Drug-related cystitis. • Some medicines, such as certain drugs used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), can cause inflammation of the bladder as the broken-down components of the drugs exit the body. • Radiation cystitis. • Radiation treatment of the pelvic area can cause inflammatory changes in bladder tissue. • Foreign-body cystitis. • Long-term use of a catheter can make bacterial infections and tissue damage more likely. • Both of these can cause bladder inflammation. • Chemical cystitis. • Some people may be extra sensitive to chemicals found in certain products. • These might include bubble bath, personal hygiene spray or spermicidal jelly. • An allergic-type reaction can happen within the bladder, causing inflammation. • Cystitis associated with other conditions. • Cystitis may sometimes occur as a complication of other conditions, such as diabetes, kidney stones, an enlarged prostate or spinal cord injury. • Some people are more likely than others to develop bladder infections or repeated urinary tract infections. • Women can have this problem. • A key reason is physical anatomy. • Women have a short urethra. • This means bacteria that can cause an infection don't have as far to travel to reach the bladder. • You may be at greater risk of bladder infections or repeated UTIs if you: Are sexually active. • During sex, bacteria can be pushed into the urethra. • Use certain types of birth control. • Using a diaphragm increases the risk of a UTI. • Diaphragms that contain spermicide may increase risk even more. • Are pregnant. • Hormone changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of a bladder infection. • Have gone through menopause. • Changes to hormones that happen after menopause often can lead to UTIs. • Other risk factors include: Interference with the flow of urine. • This can occur in conditions such as a stone in the bladder or an enlarged prostate. • Changes in the immune system. • This can happen with certain conditions, such as diabetes, HIV infection and cancer treatment. • Long-term use of urinary catheters. • These tubes may be needed in people with chronic illnesses or in older adults. • Prolonged use can put you at greater risk of bacterial infections as well as bladder tissue damage. • In generally healthy men, cystitis is rare. • When treated right away with the proper medicine, bladder infections rarely lead to complications. • But if they aren't treated, they can become something more serious. • Complications may include: Kidney infection. • An untreated bladder infection can lead to a kidney infection. • This is also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis). • Kidney infections may permanently damage the kidneys. • Blood in the urine. • With cystitis, you may have blood cells in the urine. • Often, they can be seen only with a microscope. • This condition is called microscopic hematuria. • It usually goes away after treatment. • If blood cells still appear in the urine after treatment, you may need to see a specialist to find out the cause. • Blood in the urine that you can see is called gross hematuria. • This happens rarely with typical, bacterial cystitis. • But this sign may be more common if you have cystitis that happens after chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer. • Self-care measures to prevent repeated bladder infections aren't well studied. • But some providers recommend these tips for prevention: Drink plenty of liquids, especially water. • Drinking lots of fluids is especially important after chemotherapy or radiation therapy, particularly on treatment days. • Urinate frequently. • If you feel the urge to urinate, don't delay using the toilet. • Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement. • This prevents bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. • Take showers rather than tub baths. • If you're prone to infections, showering rather than taking a bath may help prevent them. • Gently wash the skin around the genitals. • Do this daily, but don't use harsh soaps or wash too vigorously. • The delicate skin in this area can become irritated. • Empty your bladder as soon as possible after sex. • Drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. • Avoid using deodorant sprays or hygiene products in the genital area. • These products can irritate the urethra and bladder. • Cranberry juice or tablets containing proanthocyanidin are often recommended to help reduce the risk of recurrent bladder infections. • Although research in this area is inconsistent, there is some evidence that cranberry may work to prevent recurrent infections for some people. • Cranberry products are generally considered to be safe in healthy people without any medical conditions. • But as a home remedy, be careful with cranberry juice or cranberry products if you're taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin). • It's possible that there could be an interaction between cranberry and warfarin that could lead to bleeding. • But the evidence is mixed. • Cranberry has not been shown to be an effective treatment if you already have a bladder infection.",
