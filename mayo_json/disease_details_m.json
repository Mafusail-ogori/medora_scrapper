      "Overview": "Wet macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. • It is a type of age-related macular degeneration where blood vessels leak fluid or blood into part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). • The macula is responsible for central vision. • Wet macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. • The other type, dry macular degeneration, is more common and less severe. • The wet type always begins as the dry type. • Early detection and treatment of wet macular degeneration may help reduce vision loss. • In some instances, early treatment may recover vision.",
      "Symptoms": "Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. • They may include: Visual distortions, such as straight lines that seem to be bent. • Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. • The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. • Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. • Increased blurriness of printed words. • Difficulty recognizing faces. • A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. • Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness. • See your eye care professional if: You notice changes in your central vision. • You lose the ability to see fine detail. • These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're older than age 60.",
      "Causes": "No one knows the exact cause of wet macular degeneration, but it develops in people who have dry macular degeneration. • Of all people with age-related macular degeneration, about 20% have the wet form. • Wet macular degeneration can develop in different ways: Vision loss caused by irregular blood vessel growth. • Sometimes new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula. • This growth isn't typical, and when it happens it's known as choroidal neovascularization. • The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye, called the sclera. • These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina's function and leading to vision loss. • Vision loss caused by fluid buildup in the back of the eye. • When fluid leaks from the choroid, it can collect between the thin cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina or within the layers of the retina. • This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of macular degeneration include: Age. • This disease is most common in people over 50. • Family history and genetics. • This disease has a hereditary component, meaning it can run in families. • Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition. • Race. • Macular degeneration is more common in white people. • Smoking. • Smoking cigarettes or being exposed to tobacco smoke on a regular basis greatly increases the risk of macular degeneration. • Obesity. • Research suggests that obesity may increase the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to a more severe form of the disease. • Cardiovascular disease. • If you have diseases that affect your heart and blood vessels, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.",
      "Complications": "People whose wet macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. • With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. • This condition is known as Charles Bonnet syndrome.",
      "Prevention": "It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. • The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing wet macular degeneration: Manage all other medical conditions. • For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition. • Don't smoke. • People who smoke are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are people who don't smoke. • Ask a healthcare professional for help stopping smoking. • Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. • If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day. • Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. • These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration. • Include fish in your diet. • Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. • Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids."

      "Overview": "Male breast cancer is a rare cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the breast tissue of men. • Breast cancer is typically thought of as a condition that happens in women. • But everyone is born with some breast tissue. • So anyone can get breast cancer. • Male breast cancer is rare. • It happens most often in older men, though it can occur at any age. • Treatment for male breast cancer typically involves surgery to remove the breast tissue. • Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be recommended as well.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include: A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest. • Changes to the skin covering the chest, such as dimpling, puckering, scaling or changes in the color of the skin. • Changes to the nipple, such as changes in the skin color or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward. • Discharge or bleeding from the nipple. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other health care professional if you have symptoms that worry you. • It's not clear what causes male breast cancer. • Male breast cancer starts when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • Everyone is born with a small amount of breast tissue. • Breast tissue consists of milk-producing glands, ducts that carry milk to the nipples and fat. • During puberty, people assigned female at birth typically begin growing more breast tissue. • People assigned male at birth generally do not grow more breast tissue. • But because everyone is born with a small amount of breast tissue, breast cancer can develop in anyone. • Types of male breast cancer include: Cancer that begins in the milk ducts, called ductal carcinoma. • This type of breast cancer starts in the tubes that connect to the nipple. • These tubes are called ducts. • Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer. • Cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands, called lobular carcinoma. • This type of cancer begins in the glands that have the potential to make breast milk. • These glands are called lobules. • Lobular carcinoma is less common in people assigned male at birth because they usually have fewer lobular cells. • Other types of cancer. • Other, rarer types of male breast cancer include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer. • Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include: Older age. • The risk of breast cancer increases with age. • Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s. • Hormone therapy for prostate cancer or medicines containing estrogen. • If you take estrogen-related medicines, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer rises. • Family history of breast cancer. • If you have a blood relative with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of getting the disease. • Inherited DNA changes that increase breast cancer risk. • Some of the DNA changes that can lead to breast cancer are passed down from parents to children. • People born with these DNA changes have a greater risk of breast cancer. • For example, the DNA changes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of male breast cancer. • Klinefelter syndrome. • This genetic syndrome occurs when males are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. • Klinefelter syndrome affects the development of the testicles. • It causes changes in the balance of hormones in the body, which can increase the risk of male breast cancer. • Liver disease. • Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can change the balance of hormones in the body. • This raises the risk of male breast cancer. • Obesity. • Obesity is linked with higher levels of estrogen in the body. • This increases the risk of male breast cancer. • Testicle disease or surgery. • Having inflamed testicles, called orchitis, or surgery to remove a testicle, called orchiectomy, can increase the risk of male breast cancer. • For most men, there's no way to prevent male breast cancer. • For those that have an increased risk of cancer, there may be ways to lower the risk. • If breast cancer runs in your family. • Certain DNA changes are linked to breast cancer. • If these DNA changes run in your family, you might have an increased risk of breast cancer. • DNA changes that increase the risk of male breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2. • If you know that a blood relative carries DNA changes linked to breast cancer, tell your doctor or other health care professional. • Together you can decide whether you should have genetic testing to see if you also carry the DNA changes. • If you carry a DNA change that increases your risk, you might need breast cancer screening. • Usually this involves becoming familiar with the skin and tissue on your chest. • Tell your health professional if you notice any changes. • You also might have an annual exam of your chest. • If you're a transgender man. • If you haven't had gender-affirming surgery on your chest, talk with your doctor or other health care professional about breast cancer screening. • In general, follow the screening guidelines for people assigned female at birth. • If you've had gender-affirming surgery to your chest, breast cancer is still possible, though it's rare. • Often a small amount of breast tissue remains after surgery. • Get to know the look and feel of the skin on your chest. • Report any changes to your health care team right away.",

      "Overview": "Nearly 1 in 7 couples is infertile, which means they haven't been able to conceive a child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer. • In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays at least a partial role. • Male infertility can be caused by low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. • Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors may contribute to male infertility. • The inability to conceive a child can be stressful and frustrating, but a number of treatments are available for male infertility.",
      "Symptoms": "The main sign of male infertility is the inability to conceive a child. • There may be no other obvious signs or symptoms. • In some cases, however, an underlying problem such as an inherited disorder, hormonal imbalance, dilated veins around the testicle or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm causes signs and symptoms. • Signs and symptoms you may notice include: Problems with sexual function — for example, difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated, reduced sexual desire, or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area Recurrent respiratory infections Inability to smell Abnormal breast growth (gynecomastia) Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosomal or hormonal abnormality A lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate) See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following: Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area A history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems A groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery A partner over age 35 Male fertility is a complex process. • To get your partner pregnant, the following must occur: You must produce healthy sperm. • Initially, this involves the growth and formation of the male reproductive organs during puberty. • At least one of your testicles must be functioning correctly, and your body must produce testosterone and other hormones to trigger and maintain sperm production. • Sperm have to be carried into the semen. • Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis. • There needs to be enough sperm in the semen. • If the number of sperm in your semen (sperm count) is low, it decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg. • A low sperm count is fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or fewer than 39 million per ejaculate. • Sperm must be functional and able to move. • If the movement (motility) or function of your sperm is abnormal, the sperm may not be able to reach or penetrate your partner's egg. • Problems with male fertility can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments: Varicocele. • A varicocele is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. • It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility. • Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it may be related to abnormal blood flow. • Varicoceles lead to reduced sperm quantity and quality. • Infection. • Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm. • These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. • Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved. • Ejaculation issues. • Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out the tip of the penis. • Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, medications, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra. • Antibodies that attack sperm. • Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to eliminate them. • Tumors. • Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes. • In some cases, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can affect male fertility. • Undescended testicles. • In some males, during fetal development one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). • Decreased fertility is more likely in men who have had this condition. • Hormone imbalances. • Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves or an abnormality affecting other hormonal systems including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands. • Low testosterone (male hypogonadism) and other hormonal problems have a number of possible underlying causes. • Defects of tubules that transport sperm. • Many different tubes carry sperm. • They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions. • Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra. • Chromosome defects. • Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome — in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (instead of one X and one Y) — cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs. • Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis and Kallmann's syndrome. • Problems with sexual intercourse. • These can include trouble keeping or maintaining an erection sufficient for sex (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse, anatomical abnormalities such as having a urethral opening beneath the penis (hypospadias), or psychological or relationship problems that interfere with sex. • Celiac disease. • Celiac disease is a digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to a protein found in wheat called gluten. • The condition may contribute to male infertility. • Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet. • Certain medications. • Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), some ulcer drugs, some arthritis drugs and certain other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility. • Prior surgeries. • Certain surgeries may prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others. • Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm production or sperm function. • Specific causes include: Industrial chemicals. • Extended exposure to certain chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents and painting materials may contribute to low sperm counts. • Heavy metal exposure. • Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also may cause infertility. • Radiation or X-rays. • Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal. • With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced. • Overheating the testicles. • Elevated temperatures may impair sperm production and function. • Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs may temporarily impair your sperm count. • Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also may increase the temperature in your scrotum and may slightly reduce sperm production. • But, the research isn't conclusive. • Some other causes of male infertility include: Drug use. • Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. • Use of cocaine or marijuana may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well. • Alcohol use. • Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production. • Liver disease caused by excessive drinking also may lead to fertility problems. • Tobacco smoking. • Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. • Secondhand smoke also may affect male fertility. • Weight. • Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm themselves as well as by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility. • Risk factors linked to male infertility include: Smoking tobacco Using alcohol Using certain illicit drugs Being overweight Having certain past or present infections Being exposed to toxins Overheating the testicles Having experienced trauma to the testicles Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery Having a history of undescended testicles Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses, such as sickle cell disease Taking certain medications or undergoing medical treatments, such as surgery or radiation used for treating cancer Complications of male infertility can include: Stress and relationship difficulties related to the inability to have a child Expensive and involved reproductive techniques Increased risk of testicular cancer, melanoma, colon cancer and prostate cancer Male infertility isn't always preventable. • However, you can try to avoid some known causes of male infertility. • For example: Don't smoke. • Limit or abstain from alcohol. • Steer clear of illicit drugs. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Don't get a vasectomy. • Avoid things that lead to prolonged heat for the testicles. • Reduce stress. • Avoid exposure to pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins.",

      "Symptoms": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors often cause symptoms that get worse quickly. • Symptoms include: Pain where the tumor is growing. • Weakness when trying to move the body part that has the tumor. • A growing lump of tissue under the skin. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. • Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are rare, so your provider might first look for more-common causes for your symptoms. • It's not clear what causes most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. • Experts know that these cancers begin when a cell in the lining around a nerve gets changes in its DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to make more cells quickly. • These cells continue to live when healthy cells die as part of their life cycle. • The cells then can form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow into and kill healthy body tissue. • In time, the cells can spread to other parts of the body. • Factors that increase the risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors include: Radiation therapy for cancer. • A malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor might occur in the area treated with radiation 10 to 20 years after treatment. • Noncancerous nerve tumors. • Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors can develop from nerve tumors that aren't cancerous, such as neurofibroma. • A condition that runs in families. • Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors occur more often in people with neurofibromatosis 1. • This condition increases the risk of tumors in the nerves.",

      "Overview": "Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue — the fibers that support and anchor your organs and other structures in your body. • Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels and skeleton. • People with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and thin with unusually long arms, legs, fingers and toes. • The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe. • If your aorta — the large blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — is affected, the condition can become life-threatening. • Treatment usually includes medications to keep your blood pressure low to reduce the strain on your aorta. • Regular monitoring to check for damage progression is vital. • Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome can vary greatly, even among members of the same family, because the disorder can affect so many different areas of the body. • Some people experience only mild effects, but others develop life-threatening complications. • Marfan syndrome features may include: Tall and slender build Disproportionately long arms, legs and fingers A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward A high, arched palate and crowded teeth Heart murmurs Extreme nearsightedness An abnormally curved spine Flat feet If you think that you or your child may have Marfan syndrome, talk to your doctor or pediatrician. • If your doctor suspects a problem, you'll likely be referred to a specialist for further evaluation. • Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect in the gene that enables your body to produce a protein that helps give connective tissue its elasticity and strength. • Most people with Marfan syndrome inherit the abnormal gene from a parent who has the disorder. • Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the defective gene. • In about 25% of the people who have Marfan syndrome, the abnormal gene comes from neither parent. • In these cases, a new mutation develops spontaneously. • Marfan syndrome affects men and women equally and occurs among all races and ethnic groups. • Because it's a genetic condition, the greatest risk factor for Marfan syndrome is having a parent with the disorder. • Because Marfan syndrome can affect almost any part of your body, it may cause a wide variety of complications. • The most dangerous complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels. • Faulty connective tissue can weaken the aorta — the large artery that arises from the heart and supplies blood to the body. • Aortic aneurysm. • The pressure of blood leaving your heart can cause the wall of your aorta to bulge out, like a weak spot in a tire. • In people who have Marfan syndrome, this is most likely to happen at the aortic root — where the artery leaves your heart. • Aortic dissection. • The wall of the aorta is made up of layers. • Dissection occurs when a small tear in the innermost layer of the aorta's wall allows blood to squeeze between the inner and outer layers of the wall. • This can cause severe pain in the chest or back. • An aortic dissection weakens the vessel's structure and can result in a rupture, which may be fatal. • Valve malformations. • People who have Marfan syndrome can have weak tissue in their heart valves. • This can produce stretching of the valve tissue and abnormal valve function. • When heart valves don't work properly, your heart often has to work harder to compensate. • This can eventually lead to heart failure. • Eye complications may include: Lens dislocation. • The focusing lens within your eye can move out of place if its supporting structures weaken. • The medical term for this problem is ectopia lentis, and it occurs in more than half the people who have Marfan syndrome. • Retinal problems. • Marfan syndrome also increases the risk of a detachment or tear in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back wall of your eye. • Early-onset glaucoma or cataracts. • People who have Marfan syndrome tend to develop these eye problems at a younger age. • Glaucoma causes the pressure within the eye to increase, which can damage the optic nerve. • Cataracts are cloudy areas in the eye's normally clear lens. • Marfan syndrome increases the risk of abnormal curves in the spine, such as scoliosis. • It can also interfere with the normal development of the ribs, which can cause the breastbone to either protrude or appear sunken into the chest. • Foot pain and low back pain are common with Marfan syndrome. • Marfan syndrome can weaken the walls of the aorta, the main artery that leaves the heart. • During pregnancy, the heart pumps more blood than usual. • This can put extra stress on the aorta, which increases the risk of a deadly dissection or rupture.",

      "Overview": "Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an inherited disorder that prevents your body from breaking down certain fats and turning them into energy. • Your metabolism involves the processes your body uses to produce energy. • MCAD deficiency can cause problems with your metabolism. • If left untreated, MCAD deficiency may lead to severe lack of energy and tiredness, liver disease, coma, and other serious health problems. • Also, the level of sugar in your blood can drop dangerously low — a condition called hypoglycemia. • Prevention and prompt treatment are essential regardless of blood sugar level. • If you have MCAD deficiency, a sudden episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be caused by common illnesses, high fever, stomach problems or going too long without eating, known as prolonged fasting. • MCAD deficiency is present from birth and is a lifelong condition. • In the United States, all states test for MCAD deficiency at birth as part of newborn screening. • Many other countries also provide routine newborn screening for MCAD deficiency. • If MCAD deficiency is diagnosed and treated early, the disorder can be well managed through diet and lifestyle.",
      "Symptoms": "MCAD deficiency is usually first identified in babies and young children. • In rare cases, the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood. • Symptoms can vary among people with MCAD deficiency. • They may include: Vomiting. • Low or no energy. • Weak feeling. • Low blood sugar. • A sudden severe episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be due to: Going too long without eating. • Missing meals. • Common infections. • High fever. • Ongoing stomach and digestive problems that may cause vomiting and diarrhea. • Intense exercise. • In the United States and many other countries, newborn screening programs test for MCAD deficiency. • After your first evaluation, you may be referred to a specialist in evaluating and treating MCAD deficiency. • You may also be referred to other health care team members, such as a registered dietitian. • Contact your health care team if you've been diagnosed with MCAD deficiency and have a high fever, no appetite, stomach or digestive symptoms, or a planned medical procedure that requires fasting.",
      "Causes": "When you don't have enough of the MCAD enzyme in your body, certain fats called medium-chain fatty acids can't be broken down and turned into energy. • This leads to low energy and low blood sugar. • Also, fatty acids can build up in body tissues and cause damage. • MCAD deficiency is caused by a change in the ACADM gene. • The condition is inherited from both parents in an autosomal recessive pattern. • This means that both parents are carriers — each has one changed gene and one unchanged gene — but they don't have symptoms of the condition. • The child with MCAD deficiency inherits two copies of the changed gene — one from each parent. • If you inherit only one changed gene, you won't develop MCAD deficiency. • With one changed gene, you are a carrier and can pass the changed gene to your children. • But they wouldn't develop the condition unless they also inherited a changed gene from their other parent.",
      "Risk factors": "A child is at risk of MCAD deficiency if both parents are carriers of a gene known to cause it. • The child then inherits two copies of the gene — one from each parent. • Children who inherit only one copy of the affected gene from one parent typically won't develop MCAD deficiency but will be carriers of the gene.",
      "Complications": "If metabolic crisis caused by MCAD deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to: Seizures. • Liver problems. • Brain damage. • Coma. • Sudden death."

      "Overview": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. • This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. • The artery is called the celiac artery. • The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. • Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. • The celiac artery sits just below the arch. • But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. • The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. • This pressure can cause the symptoms of MALS. • The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people. • MALS can occur in anyone, even children. • Other names for MALS are: Celiac artery compression syndrome. • Celiac axis syndrome. • Dunbar syndrome. • Treatment involves surgery to release pressure from the ligament on the artery and nerves.",
      "Symptoms": "Pressure on the celiac artery doesn't always cause symptoms. • MALS symptoms are mainly caused by pressure on the nerves. • Symptoms of MALS include: Stomach pain after eating or exercising. • The stomach pain gets better by leaning forward or backward or standing while eating. • Fear of eating food because of pain. • Unintended weight loss. • Bloating. • Diarrhea. • Nausea and vomiting. • There are many different causes of stomach pain. • If your stomach pain continues despite home care, call your healthcare professional. • You need a complete physical exam and tests to determine the specific cause. • If your stomach pain is bad and activity or movement makes it worse, call your healthcare professional immediately. • Get medical help right away if your stomach pain occurs with: Bloody stools. • Fever. • Nausea and vomiting that doesn't go away. • Severe tenderness when you touch your belly. • Swelling of the belly. • Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, also called jaundice. • Sometimes upper stomach pain can be confused with chest pain. • Sometimes chest pain can be due to a heart attack. • Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have chest or upper stomach pain with or without any of the following symptoms: Pressure, fullness or tightness in your chest. • Crushing or searing pain that spreads to your jaw, neck, shoulders, and one or both arms. • Pain that lasts more than a few minutes or gets worse with activity. • Shortness of breath. • Cold sweats. • Dizziness or weakness. • Nausea or vomiting.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, is not known.",
      "Risk factors": "Because the cause of MALS is poorly understood, the risk factors are unclear. • Median arcuate ligament syndrome is more common in adults than in children. • It also is more common among women than among men. • MALS also has been seen in identical twins, so genetics may play a role. • Some people have developed median arcuate ligament syndrome after pancreatic surgery or blunt injury to the upper stomach area.",
      "Complications": "A complication of median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, is long-term pain, especially after meals. • The pain can lead to a fear of eating and significant weight loss. • The pain and related depression or anxiety can greatly impact quality of life. • MALS symptoms may be vague. • The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. • It may take some time to get an accurate diagnosis."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of medication overuse headaches depend on the type of headache being treated and the medicine used. • Medication overuse headaches tend to: Happen every day or nearly every day. • These headaches often wake people from sleep. • Improve with pain medicine but then return as the medicine wears off. • Other symptoms may include: Nausea. • Restlessness. • Trouble concentrating. • Memory problems. • Irritability. • It's common to have some headaches. • But take headaches seriously. • Some types of headaches can be life-threatening. • Seek immediate medical care if your headache: Is sudden and very bad. • Happens with a fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, seizure, double vision, weakness, numbness or trouble speaking. • Follows a head injury. • Gets worse even with rest and pain medicine. • Is a new type of headache that's lasting, especially in people older than 50. • Happens with shortness of breath. • Happens when upright but goes away when lying flat. • Talk with your healthcare professional if: You have two or more headaches a week. • You take a pain reliever for your headaches more than twice a week. • You need more than the dose you're supposed to take of pain medicines you get without a prescription to relieve your headaches. • Your headache pattern changes.",
      "Causes": "Experts don't know exactly why medication overuse headaches happen. • The risk of getting these headaches varies depending on the medicine. • But most headache medicines can lead to medication overuse headaches, including: Simple pain relievers. • Common pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) have a low risk of causing medication overuse headaches. • Taking more than the daily dosages raises the risk. • Combined pain relievers. • Pain relievers you can buy at the store that combine caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin) have a moderate risk of causing medication overuse headaches. • This group also includes combined prescription medicines that have the sedative butalbital (Butapap, Lanorinal, others). • Medicines with butalbital have a high risk of causing medication overuse headaches. • It's best not to take them to treat headaches. • Migraine medicines. • Triptans (Imitrex, Zomig, others) used to treat migraine have a high risk of medication overuse headaches. • The ergot dihydroergotamine (Migranal, Trudhesa) appears to have a lower risk of causing medication overuse headaches. • A newer group of migraine medicines known as gepants don't seem to cause medication overuse headaches. • Gepants include ubrogepant (Ubrelvy), rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) and zavegepant (Zavzpret). • Opioids. • Painkillers made from opium or from human-made opium compounds have a high risk of causing medication overuse headaches. • They include oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others) hydrocodone, tramadol (Conzip, Qdolo, others), and combined codeine and acetaminophen. • Taking them 10 or more days a month can lead to medication overuse headaches.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for getting medication overuse headaches include: Long-term history of headaches. • A long-term history of headaches, especially migraines, raises the risk. • Medication overuse headache often occurs when a headache condition such as migraine is not well controlled and may make the underlying headache condition difficult to treat. • Regular use of headache medicines. • Your risk goes up if you use combined painkillers, opioids, ergotamine or triptans 10 or more days a month. • Risk also rises if you use simple painkillers more than 15 days a month. • This is especially true if you use these medicines for three months or longer. • History of substance use disorders. • A history of alcohol use disorder or another substance use disorder puts you at risk.",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent medication overuse headaches: Take your headache medicine as prescribed. • Contact your healthcare professional if you need headache medicine more than twice a week. • Don't take medicines that have butalbital or opioids if possible. • Use painkillers you can get without a prescription fewer than 14 days a month. • Limit use of triptans or combined pain relievers to no more than nine days a month. • Taking care of yourself can help prevent most headaches. • Stay away from headache triggers. • If you're not sure what triggers your headaches, keep a headache diary. • Write down details about every headache. • You may see a pattern. • Get enough sleep. • Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. • Don't skip meals. • Start your day with a healthy breakfast. • Eat lunch and dinner at about the same time every day. • Stay hydrated. • Be sure to drink plenty of water or other fluids that don't have caffeine. • Exercise regularly. • Physical activity causes the body to release chemicals that block pain signals to the brain. • With your healthcare professional's OK, choose activities you enjoy. • You might walk, swim or cycle. • Lower stress. • Make your schedule simpler. • Plan your day. • Try to stay positive. • Lose weight. • Obesity can add to headaches. • If you need to lose weight, ask your healthcare professional to help you find a program that works for you. • Quit smoking. • If you smoke, talk to your healthcare professional about quitting. • Smoking is linked to a higher risk of medication overuse headaches. • Limit caffeine. • Daily doses of caffeine also may add to medication overuse headaches. • Caffeine may come from coffee, soda, pain relievers and other products. • Read product labels to make sure you're not getting more caffeine than you know about."

      "Symptoms": "Medulloblastoma symptoms happen when the cancer grows or causes pressure to build up in the brain. • Signs and symptoms of medulloblastoma may include: Dizziness. • Double vision. • Headaches. • Nausea. • Poor coordination. • Tiredness. • Unsteady walk. • Vomiting. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes medulloblastoma. • This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the brain. • Medulloblastoma happens when cells in the brain develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor that can grow to push on nearby structures. • The cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • They also can spread to other areas.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of medulloblastoma include: Young age. • Medulloblastoma can happen at any age. • This cancer happens most often in children. • Inherited syndromes. • Medulloblastoma happens more often in families that have a history of conditions that increase the risk of cancer. • These conditions include Fanconi anemia, Gorlin syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Turcot syndrome."

      "Overview": "Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes. • Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. • The pigment is called melanin. • Melanoma typically starts on skin that's often exposed to the sun. • This includes the skin on the arms, back, face and legs. • Melanoma also can form in the eyes. • Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat. • The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. • Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. • Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. • Limiting exposure to UV light can help reduce the risk of melanoma. • The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women. • Knowing the symptoms of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. • Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is found early.",
      "Symptoms": "The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: A change in an existing mole. • The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin. • Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. • It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. • Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. • Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. • This includes the arms, back, face and legs. • Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. • This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. • Melanoma also can happen inside the body. • These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin. • Typical moles are generally a uniform color. • They might look pink, tan, brown or black. • In people with brown and Black skin, typical moles are more likely to be dark brown or black. • Typical moles have a distinct border separating the mole from the surrounding skin. • They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter. • Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. • By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. • Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even go away with age. • Some moles aren't typical. • They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers. • Characteristics may include: Asymmetrical shape. • Look for moles with unusual shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. • Changes in color. • Look for growths that have many colors or unusual color patterns. • Changes in size. • Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). • Changes in symptoms. • Look for changes in symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding. • Unusual border. • Look for moles with unusual, notched or scalloped borders. • Moles that become cancers can all look very different. • Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. • Melanomas also can develop in areas of the body that have little or no exposure to the sun. • These areas may include the spaces between the toes and on the palms, soles, scalp or genitals. • These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. • When melanoma occurs in people with brown or Black skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. • Hidden melanomas include: Melanoma inside the body. • Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane. • This tissue lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. • Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. • Melanoma in the eye. • Eye melanoma also is called ocular melanoma. • It most often occurs in the layer of tissue beneath the white of the eye. • This layer is called the uvea. • An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam. • Melanoma under a nail. • Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. • It also can be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. • Acral-lentiginous melanoma tends to be very dark, flat and have very unusual borders. • It's more common in people of Asian descent and people with brown or Black skin. • Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice any skin changes that worry you. • Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. • Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. • The pigment is called melanin. • Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. • It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. • Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. • Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds. • UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. • This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma. • Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include: A family history of melanoma. • If a close relative has had melanoma, you have a greater chance of developing a melanoma, too. • Close relatives may include a parent, child or sibling. • A history of sunburn. • One or more severe, blistering sunburns can increase your risk of melanoma. • Exposure to UV light. • The ultraviolet light, also called UV light, that comes from the sun and from tanning lights and beds increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. • Having many moles or moles that aren't typical. • Having more than 50 typical moles on your body indicates an increased risk of melanoma. • Also, having a type of mole that isn't typical increases the risk of melanoma. • Known medically as dysplastic nevi, these moles tend to be larger than typical moles. • They may have unusual borders and a mixture of colors. • Living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation. • People living closer to the earth's equator experience more direct sun rays. • Therefore, they experience higher amounts of UV light from the sun than people living farther north or south. • Also, people who live at a higher elevation are more exposed to UV light. • Skin that sunburns easily. • Anyone can get melanoma, but it's most common in people with white skin. • If you have blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily, you're more likely to develop melanoma. • Weakened immune system. • If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medications or illness, there might be a higher risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. • People with a weakened immune system include those taking medicines to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. • Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, can weaken the immune system. • You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: Avoid tanning lamps and beds. • Tanning lamps and beds give off ultraviolet light, also called UV light. • Exposure to this kind of light can increase your risk of skin cancer. • Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. • For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. • Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. • Become familiar with your skin so that you'll notice changes. • Check your skin often for new skin growths. • Look for changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. • With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. • Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. • Check both the front and back of your legs and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. • Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. • Wear protective clothing. • When you go outside during the day, wear clothes that help protect your skin from the sun's rays. • Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. • Wear a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor. • Some companies also sell protective clothing. • A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. • Don't forget sunglasses. • Look for those that block both types of UV light that come from the sun, called UVA and UVB. • Wear sunscreen year-round. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously. • Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.",

      "Overview": "Meniere's disease is an inner ear problem that can cause dizzy spells, also called vertigo, and hearing loss. • Most of the time, Meniere's disease affects only one ear. • Meniere's disease can happen at any age. • But it usually starts between the ages of 40 to 60. • It's thought to be a lifelong condition. • But some treatments can help ease symptoms and lessen how it affects your life long term.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Meniere's disease include: Regular dizzy spells. • You have a spinning feeling that starts and stops suddenly. • Vertigo may start without warning. • It usually lasts 20 minutes to 12 hours, but not more than 24 hours. • Serious vertigo can cause nausea. • Hearing loss. • Hearing loss in Meniere's disease may come and go, especially early on. • Over time, hearing loss can be long-lasting and not get better. • Ringing in the ear. • Ringing in the ear is called tinnitus. • Tinnitus is the term for when you have a ringing, buzzing, roaring, whistling or hissing sound in your ear. • Feeling of fullness in the ear. • People with Meniere's disease often feel pressure in the ear. • This is called aural fullness. • After a vertigo attack, symptoms get better and might go away for a while. • Over time, how many vertigo attacks you have may lessen. • See your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of Meniere's disease. • Other illnesses can cause these problems. • So, it's important to find out what's causing your symptoms as soon as possible. • The cause of Meniere's disease isn't known. • Symptoms of Meniere's disease may be due to extra fluid in the inner ear called endolymph. • But it isn't clear what causes this fluid to build up in the inner ear. • Issues that affect the fluid, which might lead to Meniere's disease, include: Poor fluid drainage. • This may be due to a blockage or irregular ear shape. • Autoimmune disorders. • Viral infection. • Genetics. • Because no single cause has been found, Meniere's disease likely has a combination of causes. • Meniere's disease is most common in people ages 40 to 60. • Females may have a slightly higher risk than men. • You may have a higher chance of getting Meniere's disease if someone in your family has had the condition. • You may have a higher risk of Meniere's disease if you have an autoimmune disorder. • The most difficult complications of Meniere's disease can be: Unexpected vertigo attacks. • Possibly losing your hearing long term. • The disease can happen at any time. • This can cause worry and stress. • Vertigo can cause you to lose balance. • This can increase your risk of falls and accidents.",

      "Overview": "A meningioma is a tumor that grows from the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, called the meninges. • A meningioma is not a brain tumor, but it may press on the nearby brain, nerves and vessels. • Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head. • Most meningiomas grow very slowly. • They can grow over many years without causing symptoms. • But sometimes, their effects on nearby brain tissue, nerves or vessels may cause serious disability. • Meningiomas occur more often in women. • They're often found at older ages. • But they can happen at any age. • Because most meningiomas grow slowly, often without symptoms, they do not always need treatment right away. • Instead, they may be watched over time.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a meningioma most often begin slowly. • They may be hard to notice at first. • Symptoms may depend on where in the brain the meningioma is. • Rarely, it can be in the spine. • Symptoms may include: Changes in vision, such as seeing double or blurring. • Headaches that are worse in the morning. • Hearing loss or ringing in the ears. • Memory loss. • Loss of smell. • Seizures. • Weakness in the arms or legs. • Trouble speaking. • Most symptoms of a meningioma come on slowly. • But sometimes a meningioma needs care right away. • Seek emergency care if you have: Sudden onset of seizures. • Sudden changes in vision or memory. • Make an appointment to see your healthcare professional if you have lasting symptoms that worry you, such as headaches that get worse over time. • Often, because meningiomas do not cause any symptoms you notice, they are found only from imaging scans done for other reasons. • It isn't clear what causes a meningioma. • Experts know that something changes some cells in the meninges. • The changes makes them multiply out of control. • This leads to a meningioma. • Being exposed to radiation as a child is the only known environmental risk factor for getting meningioma. • There's no good evidence to show that meningiomas happen because of cellphone use. • Risk factors for a meningioma include: Radiation treatment. • Radiation therapy that involves the head may increase the risk of a meningioma. • Female hormones. • Meningiomas are more common in women. • This might mean that female hormones may play a role. • Some studies also have suggested a link between breast cancer and meningioma risk related to the role of hormones. • Some research suggests that the use of oral birth control and hormone replacement therapy could raise the risk of meningioma growth. • An inherited nervous system condition. • The rare condition neurofibromatosis 2 increases the risk of meningioma and other brain tumors. • Obesity. • A high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for many types of cancers. • Several large studies have found that meningiomas happen more often in obese people. • But the link between obesity and meningiomas is not clear. • A meningioma and its treatment can cause long-term complications. • Treatment most often involves surgery and radiation therapy. • Complications may include: Trouble focusing. • Memory loss. • Personality changes. • Seizures. • Weakness. • Changes in the senses. • Trouble with language. • Your healthcare professional can treat some complications and refer you to specialists to help you cope with other complications.",

      "Overview": "Meningitis is an infection and swelling, called inflammation, of the fluid and membranes around the brain and spinal cord. • These membranes are called meninges. • The inflammation from meningitis most often triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck. • Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States. • Bacteria, parasites and fungi also can cause it. • Sometimes meningitis improves in a few weeks without treatment. • But meningitis also can cause death. • It often needs quick treatment with antibiotics. • Seek medical care right away if you think that you or someone in your family has meningitis. • For meningitis caused by bacteria, early treatment can prevent serious complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Early meningitis symptoms may be like those of the flu. • Symptoms may come on over several hours or over a few days. • The following may be symptoms of meningitis in people older than 2 years: Sudden high fever. • Stiff neck. • Bad headache. • Nausea or vomiting. • Confusion or trouble concentrating. • Seizures. • Sleepiness or trouble waking. • Sensitivity to light. • No desire to eat or drink. • Skin rash sometimes, such as in meningococcal meningitis. • The following may be symptoms of meningitis in newborns and infants: High fever. • Constant crying. • Being very sleepy or irritable. • Trouble waking from sleep. • Being not active or sluggish. • Not waking to eat. • Poor feeding. • Vomiting. • A bulge in the soft spot on top of the baby's head. • Stiffness in the body and neck. • Seek medical care right away if you or someone in your family has meningitis symptoms such as: Fever. • Bad headache that doesn't go away. • Confusion. • Vomiting. • Stiff neck. • Bacterial meningitis can cause death within days without fast antibiotic treatment. • Delayed treatment also increases the risk of long-term brain damage. • Talk with your healthcare professional if you've been near someone with meningitis. • That may be a family member or someone you live or work with. • You may need to take medicines to prevent getting an infection. • Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States, followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections. • Because bacterial infections can lead to death, finding the cause is vital. • Germs that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause bacterial meningitis. • But bacterial meningitis also can happen when bacteria directly enter the meninges. • This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection or a skull fracture. • Rarely, some surgeries can cause it. • Several strains of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. • The most common are: Streptococcus pneumoniae. • This germ is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States. • It more often causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections. • A vaccine can help prevent this infection. • Neisseria meningitidis. • This germ causes a bacterial meningitis called meningococcal meningitis. • These germs most often cause an upper respiratory infection. • But they can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream. • This is an easy-to-catch infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults. • It may cause local outbreaks in college dorms, boarding schools and military bases. • A vaccine can help prevent infection. • Even if vaccinated, anybody who has been in close contact with a person with meningococcal meningitis should get an oral antibiotic. • This can help prevent the disease. • Haemophilus influenzae. • Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria, also called Hib bacteria, was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children. • But new Hib vaccines have greatly cut this type of meningitis. • Listeria monocytogenes. • These bacteria can be found in cheeses that aren't pasteurized, hot dogs and lunch meats. • People who are pregnant, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most likely to be affected. • During pregnancy, listeria can cross the placenta. • Infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby. • Viral meningitis is most often mild and clears on its own. • A group of viruses known as enteroviruses is most often the cause in the United States. • Enteroviruses are most common in late summer and early fall. • Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps virus, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis. • Chronic meningitis is meningitis whose symptoms last at least four weeks without letup. • There are many causes of chronic meningitis. • Symptoms can be like those of new-onset meningitis. • But they come on slower and last longer. • Symptoms may include headache, fever, vomiting and brain fog. • Fungal meningitis isn't common in the United States. • It may act like bacterial meningitis. • But symptoms may start slower and build over time. • Breathing in fungal spores found in soil, decaying wood and bird droppings can be the cause. • Fungal meningitis doesn't spread from person to person. • Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease. • It affects people with weakened immune systems, such as from AIDS. • It can cause death if not treated with an antifungal medicine. • Even with treatment, fungal meningitis may come back. • This type of meningitis is a rare complication of tuberculosis, also called TB. • But it can be serious. • Like fungal meningitis, its symptoms can start slowly and build up over days to weeks. • Tuberculosis passes easily from person to person. • Tuberculous meningitis needs treatment with TB medicines. • Parasites can cause a rare type of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis. • A tapeworm infection in the brain or cerebral malaria also can cause parasitic meningitis. • Amoebic meningitis is a rare type that sometimes comes from swimming in fresh water. • It can quickly become life-threatening. • The main parasites that cause meningitis most often infect animals. • People can get infected by eating foods that have these parasites. • Parasitic meningitis isn't spread from person to person. • Causes of meningitis that aren't infections include chemical reactions, medicines, allergies, some types of cancer and diseases such as sarcoidosis. • Risk factors for meningitis include: Not getting vaccinations. • Risk rises for anyone who hasn't gotten all the childhood or adult vaccinations. • Age. • Viral meningitis most often happens in children younger than age 5 years. • Bacterial meningitis is common in those younger than age 20 years. • Living in groups. • College students living in dorms, people on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis. • This is probably because the germ quickly spreads through large groups. • Pregnancy. • Pregnancy increases the risk of an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which also may cause meningitis. • The infection raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery. • Weakened immune system. • AIDS, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, medicines that lower the immune system and other factors that affect the immune system raise the risk of meningitis. • Having a spleen removed also raises risk. • For people without a spleen, a vaccine can lower the risk. • Meningitis complications can be serious. • The longer someone has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and long-term nervous system damage. • Damage can include: Hearing loss. • Trouble with vision. • Memory issues. • Learning disabilities. • Brain damage. • Trouble walking. • Seizures. • Kidney failure. • Shock. • Death. • Common germs that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing or kissing. • Germs also can spread by shared eating utensils, toothbrushes or cigarettes. • These steps can help prevent meningitis: Wash your hands. • Careful hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs. • Teach children to wash their hands often. • Teach them to wash hands before eating and after using the toilet, spending time in a crowded public place, or petting animals. • Show them how to wash and rinse their hands well. • Practice good hygiene. • Don't share drinks, foods, straws, eating utensils, lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone. • Teach children and teens to avoid sharing these items too. • Stay healthy. • Keep your immune system strong by getting enough rest, exercising regularly, and eating a good diet with fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Cover your mouth. • When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose. • Even better, cough or sneeze into your shoulder. • If you're pregnant, watch what you eat. • Reduce your risk of a listeria infection by cooking meat, including hot dogs and lunch meats, to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). • Eat only cheeses made from milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. • Check labels to be sure cheeses are made with pasteurized milk. • Vaccinations can help prevent some forms of bacterial meningitis. • Vaccinations include: Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. • This vaccine is called Hib for short. • The U.S. • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also called the CDC, suggest this vaccine for children starting at about 2 months of age. • The vaccine also is for some adults. • This includes adults who have sickle cell disease or AIDS and those who don't have a spleen. • Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. • This vaccine also is called PCV15 or PCV20. • The CDC suggests this vaccination for children younger than 2 years. • The vaccine is also for children ages 2 through 18 who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease. • Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. • This vaccine also is called PPSV23. • Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal germs might get this vaccine. • The CDC suggests the PPSV23 vaccine for all adults older than 65. • It's also for younger adults and children ages 2 and older who have weak immune systems or ongoing illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes or sickle cell anemia. • And it's for anyone who doesn't have a spleen. • Meningococcal conjugate vaccine. • This vaccine also is called MenACWY. • The CDC suggests giving a single dose of MenACWY to children ages 11 to 12, with a booster shot given at age 16. • Children who get the first vaccine between ages 13 and 15 can have the booster between ages 16 and 18. • Those who get the first shot at age 16 or older don't need a booster. • Children between the ages of 2 months and 10 years who are at high risk of bacterial meningitis can get this vaccine. • So can children in this age range who have been around someone with the disease. • It's also a vaccine for people who haven't been vaccinated who have been exposed to meningitis but aren't sick. • Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB). • The CDC suggests this vaccine for adults and children 10 years and older who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. • They include adults and children with sickle cell disease, those who have a damaged spleen or those who have had their spleen removed. • This vaccine also is for people with the rare immune disorder called complement component deficiency or who take certain medicines. • People who are exposed to an outbreak of serogroup B meningococcal disease also might get this vaccine.",
      "Causes": "Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States, followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections. • Because bacterial infections can lead to death, finding the cause is vital. • Germs that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause bacterial meningitis. • But bacterial meningitis also can happen when bacteria directly enter the meninges. • This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection or a skull fracture. • Rarely, some surgeries can cause it. • Several strains of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. • The most common are: Streptococcus pneumoniae. • This germ is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States. • It more often causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections. • A vaccine can help prevent this infection. • Neisseria meningitidis. • This germ causes a bacterial meningitis called meningococcal meningitis. • These germs most often cause an upper respiratory infection. • But they can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream. • This is an easy-to-catch infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults. • It may cause local outbreaks in college dorms, boarding schools and military bases. • A vaccine can help prevent infection. • Even if vaccinated, anybody who has been in close contact with a person with meningococcal meningitis should get an oral antibiotic. • This can help prevent the disease. • Haemophilus influenzae. • Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria, also called Hib bacteria, was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children. • But new Hib vaccines have greatly cut this type of meningitis. • Listeria monocytogenes. • These bacteria can be found in cheeses that aren't pasteurized, hot dogs and lunch meats. • People who are pregnant, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most likely to be affected. • During pregnancy, listeria can cross the placenta. • Infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby. • Viral meningitis is most often mild and clears on its own. • A group of viruses known as enteroviruses is most often the cause in the United States. • Enteroviruses are most common in late summer and early fall. • Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps virus, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis. • Chronic meningitis is meningitis whose symptoms last at least four weeks without letup. • There are many causes of chronic meningitis. • Symptoms can be like those of new-onset meningitis. • But they come on slower and last longer. • Symptoms may include headache, fever, vomiting and brain fog. • Fungal meningitis isn't common in the United States. • It may act like bacterial meningitis. • But symptoms may start slower and build over time. • Breathing in fungal spores found in soil, decaying wood and bird droppings can be the cause. • Fungal meningitis doesn't spread from person to person. • Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease. • It affects people with weakened immune systems, such as from AIDS. • It can cause death if not treated with an antifungal medicine. • Even with treatment, fungal meningitis may come back. • This type of meningitis is a rare complication of tuberculosis, also called TB. • But it can be serious. • Like fungal meningitis, its symptoms can start slowly and build up over days to weeks. • Tuberculosis passes easily from person to person. • Tuberculous meningitis needs treatment with TB medicines. • Parasites can cause a rare type of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis. • A tapeworm infection in the brain or cerebral malaria also can cause parasitic meningitis. • Amoebic meningitis is a rare type that sometimes comes from swimming in fresh water. • It can quickly become life-threatening. • The main parasites that cause meningitis most often infect animals. • People can get infected by eating foods that have these parasites. • Parasitic meningitis isn't spread from person to person. • Causes of meningitis that aren't infections include chemical reactions, medicines, allergies, some types of cancer and diseases such as sarcoidosis.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for meningitis include: Not getting vaccinations. • Risk rises for anyone who hasn't gotten all the childhood or adult vaccinations. • Age. • Viral meningitis most often happens in children younger than age 5 years. • Bacterial meningitis is common in those younger than age 20 years. • Living in groups. • College students living in dorms, people on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis. • This is probably because the germ quickly spreads through large groups. • Pregnancy. • Pregnancy increases the risk of an infection caused by listeria bacteria, which also may cause meningitis. • The infection raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery. • Weakened immune system. • AIDS, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, medicines that lower the immune system and other factors that affect the immune system raise the risk of meningitis. • Having a spleen removed also raises risk. • For people without a spleen, a vaccine can lower the risk.",
      "Complications": "Meningitis complications can be serious. • The longer someone has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and long-term nervous system damage. • Damage can include: Hearing loss. • Trouble with vision. • Memory issues. • Learning disabilities. • Brain damage. • Trouble walking. • Seizures. • Kidney failure. • Shock. • Death.",
      "Prevention": "Common germs that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing or kissing. • Germs also can spread by shared eating utensils, toothbrushes or cigarettes. • These steps can help prevent meningitis: Wash your hands. • Careful hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs. • Teach children to wash their hands often. • Teach them to wash hands before eating and after using the toilet, spending time in a crowded public place, or petting animals. • Show them how to wash and rinse their hands well. • Practice good hygiene. • Don't share drinks, foods, straws, eating utensils, lip balms or toothbrushes with anyone. • Teach children and teens to avoid sharing these items too. • Stay healthy. • Keep your immune system strong by getting enough rest, exercising regularly, and eating a good diet with fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Cover your mouth. • When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose. • Even better, cough or sneeze into your shoulder. • If you're pregnant, watch what you eat. • Reduce your risk of a listeria infection by cooking meat, including hot dogs and lunch meats, to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). • Eat only cheeses made from milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. • Check labels to be sure cheeses are made with pasteurized milk. • Vaccinations can help prevent some forms of bacterial meningitis. • Vaccinations include: Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. • This vaccine is called Hib for short. • The U.S. • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also called the CDC, suggest this vaccine for children starting at about 2 months of age. • The vaccine also is for some adults. • This includes adults who have sickle cell disease or AIDS and those who don't have a spleen. • Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. • This vaccine also is called PCV15 or PCV20. • The CDC suggests this vaccination for children younger than 2 years. • The vaccine is also for children ages 2 through 18 who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease. • Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. • This vaccine also is called PPSV23. • Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal germs might get this vaccine. • The CDC suggests the PPSV23 vaccine for all adults older than 65. • It's also for younger adults and children ages 2 and older who have weak immune systems or ongoing illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes or sickle cell anemia. • And it's for anyone who doesn't have a spleen. • Meningococcal conjugate vaccine. • This vaccine also is called MenACWY. • The CDC suggests giving a single dose of MenACWY to children ages 11 to 12, with a booster shot given at age 16. • Children who get the first vaccine between ages 13 and 15 can have the booster between ages 16 and 18. • Those who get the first shot at age 16 or older don't need a booster. • Children between the ages of 2 months and 10 years who are at high risk of bacterial meningitis can get this vaccine. • So can children in this age range who have been around someone with the disease. • It's also a vaccine for people who haven't been vaccinated who have been exposed to meningitis but aren't sick. • Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB). • The CDC suggests this vaccine for adults and children 10 years and older who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. • They include adults and children with sickle cell disease, those who have a damaged spleen or those who have had their spleen removed. • This vaccine also is for people with the rare immune disorder called complement component deficiency or who take certain medicines. • People who are exposed to an outbreak of serogroup B meningococcal disease also might get this vaccine."

      "Overview": "Menopause is when periods stop for good. • It's diagnosed after 12 months without a menstrual period, vaginal bleeding or spotting. • Menopause can happen in the 40s or 50s. • But the average age is 51 in the United States. • Menopause is natural. • But the physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, and emotional symptoms of menopause may disrupt sleep, lower energy or affect mood. • There are many treatments, from lifestyle changes to hormone therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Most often, menopause happens over time. • The months or years leading up to menopause are called perimenopause or the menopausal transition. • During the transition, the amount of hormones your ovaries make varies. • Perimenopause can last 2 to 8 years. • The average is about four years. • The hormone changes can cause symptoms such as: Irregular periods. • Vaginal dryness. • Hot flashes. • Night sweats. • Sleep problems. • Mood changes. • Trouble finding words and remembering, often called brain fog. • Different people have different menopause symptoms. • Most often, periods are not regular before they end. • Skipped periods during perimenopause are common and expected. • Often, menstrual periods skip a month and return. • Or they skip a few months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. • Period cycles tend to get shorter in early perimenopause, so periods are closer together. • As menopause gets closer, periods get farther apart for months before they end. • You can still get pregnant during this time. • If you've skipped a period but aren't sure it's due to menopause, think about taking a pregnancy test. • Keep seeing your healthcare professional for wellness visits and medical concerns before, during and after menopause. • See your healthcare professional as soon as you can if you bleed from your vagina after menopause. • Menopause can result from: Natural decline of hormones. • As you enter your late 30s, your ovaries start making less of the hormones that control your period. • These are called estrogen and progesterone. • With lower levels of them, it's harder to get pregnant. • In your 40s, your menstrual periods may get longer or shorter, heavier or lighter, and happen more often or less often. • In time, your ovaries stop releasing eggs. • Then you have no more periods. • This happens on average around age 51. • Surgery that removes the ovaries, called oophorectomy. • Ovaries make hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, that control the menstrual cycle. • Surgery to remove the ovaries causes instant menopause. • Your periods stop. • You're likely to have hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. • Symptoms can be severe because the surgery causes hormones to drop all at once rather than slowly over several years. • Surgery that removes the uterus but not the ovaries, called hysterectomy, most often doesn't cause instant menopause. • You no longer have periods. • But your ovaries still release eggs and make estrogen and progesterone for a time. • Chemotherapy and radiation therapy. • These cancer therapies can cause menopause. • They can cause symptoms such as hot flashes during or shortly after treatment. • Periods sometimes return after chemotherapy. • Then you can still get pregnant. • So you might want to keep using birth control. • Radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis, belly and lower spine can cause menopause. • Radiation to the whole body for stem cell transplant also can cause menopause. • Radiation therapy to other parts of the body, such as breast tissue or the head and neck, likely won't affect menopause. • Primary ovarian insufficiency. • About 1% of people who have menopause get it before age 40. • This is called premature menopause. • Premature menopause may result from the ovaries not making the usual levels of hormones. • This is called primary ovarian insufficiency. • It can happen from gene changes or an autoimmune disease. • Often no cause of premature menopause can be found. • Then healthcare professionals most often suggest hormone therapy. • Taken at least until the typical age of menopause, hormone therapy can protect the brain, heart and bones. • People assigned female at birth go through menopause. • The main risk factor is reaching the age of menopause. • Other risk factors include: Surgery to remove the ovaries. • Certain cancer treatments. • After menopause, your risk of certain medical conditions increases. • Examples include: Heart and blood vessel disease. • This also is called cardiovascular disease. • When your estrogen levels fall, your risk of cardiovascular disease increases. • Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both women and men. • Weakened bones, called osteoporosis. • This condition causes bones to become brittle and weak, leading to a greater risk of breaking bones. • During the first few years after menopause, you may lose bone density quickly. • This ups your risk of osteoporosis. • Bones often broken after menopause include the spine, hips and wrists. • Loss of bladder control, called urinary incontinence. • As the tissues of your vagina and urethra change, you may have sudden, strong urges to urinate often. • Then you might lose urine, called urge incontinence. • Or you might lose urine with coughing, laughing or lifting, called stress incontinence. • You may have urinary tract infections more often. • Sex problems. • Menopause causes the vagina to get drier and lose its stretch. • This can cause discomfort and slight bleeding during sexual intercourse. • Also, less feeling in the area may lessen your desire for sex, called libido. • Weight gain. • Many women gain weight during and after menopause because calorie burning, called metabolism, slows.",

      "Overview": "Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. • Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. • Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. • But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. • A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. • In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. • Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors. • Examples of signs and symptoms include: Feeling sad or down Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt Extreme mood changes of highs and lows Withdrawal from friends and activities Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations Inability to cope with daily problems or stress Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people Problems with alcohol or drug use Major changes in eating habits Sex drive changes Excessive anger, hostility or violence Suicidal thinking Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains. • If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. • Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with some mental illnesses. • If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Call your mental health specialist. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • Seek help from your primary care provider. • Reach out to a close friend or loved one. • Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. • Suicidal thinking doesn't get better on its own — so get help. • If your loved one shows signs of mental illness, have an open and honest discussion with him or her about your concerns. • You may not be able to force someone to get professional care, but you can offer encouragement and support. • You can also help your loved one find a qualified mental health professional and make an appointment. • You may even be able to go along to the appointment. • If your loved one has done self-harm or is considering doing so, take the person to the hospital or call for emergency help. • Mental illnesses, in general, are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors: Inherited traits. • Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. • Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it. • Environmental exposures before birth. • Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol or drugs while in the womb can sometimes be linked to mental illness. • Brain chemistry. • Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. • When the neural networks involving these chemicals are impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression and other emotional disorders. • Certain factors may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, including: A history of mental illness in a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce An ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes Brain damage as a result of a serious injury (traumatic brain injury), such as a violent blow to the head Traumatic experiences, such as military combat or assault Use of alcohol or recreational drugs A childhood history of abuse or neglect Few friends or few healthy relationships A previous mental illness Mental illness is common. • About 1 in 5 adults has a mental illness in any given year. • Mental illness can begin at any age, from childhood through later adult years, but most cases begin earlier in life. • The effects of mental illness can be temporary or long lasting. • You also can have more than one mental health disorder at the same time. • For example, you may have depression and a substance use disorder. • Mental illness is a leading cause of disability. • Untreated mental illness can cause severe emotional, behavioral and physical health problems. • Complications sometimes linked to mental illness include: Unhappiness and decreased enjoyment of life Family conflicts Relationship difficulties Social isolation Problems with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs Missed work or school, or other problems related to work or school Legal and financial problems Poverty and homelessness Self-harm and harm to others, including suicide or homicide Weakened immune system, so your body has a hard time resisting infections Heart disease and other medical conditions There's no sure way to prevent mental illness. • However, if you have a mental illness, taking steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and to boost low self-esteem may help keep your symptoms under control. • Follow these steps: Pay attention to warning signs. • Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms. • Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. • Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. • Consider involving family members or friends to watch for warning signs. • Get routine medical care. • Don't neglect checkups or skip visits to your primary care provider, especially if you aren't feeling well. • You may have a new health problem that needs to be treated, or you may be experiencing side effects of medication. • Get help when you need it. • Mental health conditions can be harder to treat if you wait until symptoms get bad. • Long-term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of symptoms. • Take good care of yourself. • Sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important. • Try to maintain a regular schedule. • Talk to your primary care provider if you have trouble sleeping or if you have questions about diet and physical activity.",

      "Symptoms": "The first symptom of Merkel cell carcinoma most often is a growth on the skin. • This skin cancer can happen anywhere on the body. • It happens most often on skin that typically gets sunlight. • In white people, the growth is most likely to be on the head or neck. • In Black people, the growth more often is on the legs. • A Merkel cell carcinoma can cause: A bump on the skin that often is painless. • A bump that grows quickly. • A bump whose two sides don't match. • A bump that looks pink, purple, red-brown, or the same color as the skin around it. • Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have a mole, freckle or bump that changes size, shape or color. • Also see a healthcare professional if you have a bump that grows fast or bleeds easily after minor injury, such as washing your skin or shaving.",
      "Causes": "It's often not clear what causes Merkel cell carcinoma. • This skin cancer happens when cells in the skin develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give other instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply at a fast rate. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • Merkel cell carcinoma is named for the cells where experts once thought it started. • The Merkel cells are found at the bottom of the outer layer of skin. • The Merkel cells are connected to the nerve endings in the skin that play a role in the sense of touch. • Healthcare professionals no longer believe that this cancer starts in the Merkel cells. • They don't know exactly what kind of cells it starts in. • It's often not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to Merkel cell carcinoma. • Researchers have found that a common virus plays a role in causing Merkel cell carcinoma. • The virus, called Merkel cell polyomavirus, lives on the skin. • It doesn't cause symptoms. • Experts don't know exactly how this virus causes Merkel cell carcinoma.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may raise the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma include: Skin that sunburns easily. • Anyone of any skin color can get Merkel cell carcinoma. • But it's more common in people who have less melanin in their skin. • Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. • It also helps protect the skin from damaging rays from the sun. • People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than do people with white skin. • So white people are more likely to get Merkel cell carcinoma than are people with Black or brown skin. • Too much UV light. • Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, raises the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. • UV light can come from the sun. • Being in the sun without covering the skin with clothing or sunblock raises the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. • UV light for treatment of the skin condition psoriasis also can raise the risk of this skin cancer. • Tanning bed use. • People who use indoor tanning beds have a higher risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. • A weakened immune system. • People with weakened immune systems are more likely to get Merkel cell carcinoma. • A weakened immune system can happen in people with certain health conditions, such as HIV infection and chronic leukemia. • It also can happen in people taking certain medicines, such as medicines that lower the immune response. • History of other skin cancers. • Merkel cell carcinoma is linked to other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. • Older age. • The risk of Merkel cell carcinoma goes up with age. • This cancer is most common in people older than age 50, though it can happen at any age.",
      "Complications": "Even with treatment, Merkel cell carcinoma often spreads to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, healthcare professionals sometimes say it metastasizes. • Merkel cell carcinoma tends to travel first to nearby lymph nodes. • Later it may spread to the brain, bones, liver or lungs. • It can keep these organs from working as they should. • Cancer that spreads is harder to treat and can be fatal.",
      "Prevention": "While exposure to sunlight isn't proved to cause all Merkel cell carcinomas, it is thought to be a risk factor for this cancer. • Getting less sun exposure may lower your risk of skin cancer. • Try to: For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. • Plan to be outdoors at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. • When outside, stay in the shade as much as possible. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously. • Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • To protect your skin from the sun, wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover the arms and legs. • Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face and ears. • Don't forget sunglasses. • Look for sunglasses that block both types of ultraviolet light, also called UV light, that comes from the sun. • The two types are UVA and UVB. • Look at your skin often for new growths or changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. • Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp. • Report any changes to your healthcare professional. • Even though Merkel cell carcinoma most often is on the face, head and neck, look at other areas of your body. • Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. • Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. • Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. • Also check your genital area and between your buttocks."

      "Overview": "Mesenteric ischemia (mez-un-TER-ik is-KEE-me-uh) is a condition that happens when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to your small intestine. • Decreased blood flow can permanently damage the small intestine. • Sudden loss of blood flow to the small intestine is called acute mesenteric ischemia. • The acute type is often caused by a blood clot and requires an immediate treatment, such as surgery. • Mesenteric ischemia that develops over time is called chronic mesenteric ischemia. • The chronic type is usually caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. • Chronic mesenteric ischemia is treated with open surgery or a procedure called angioplasty. • Chronic mesenteric ischemia can become acute if it's not treated. • It also can lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of the acute form of mesenteric ischemia include: Sudden, severe belly pain. • Urgent need to have a bowel movement. • Fever. • Nausea and vomiting. • Symptoms of the chronic form of mesenteric ischemia include: Belly pain that starts about 30 minutes after eating. • Pain that worsens over an hour. • Pain that goes away within 1 to 3 hours. • If you have severe, sudden belly pain that persists, seek emergency medical care. • If you develop pain after eating, make an appointment with your primary care provider.",
      "Causes": "Both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia are caused by a decrease in blood flow to the small intestine. • Acute mesenteric ischemia is most commonly caused by a blood clot in the main mesenteric artery. • The blood clot often starts in the heart. • The chronic form is most commonly caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, that narrows the arteries.",
      "Risk factors": "The most common risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia include: Atrial fibrillation — an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. • Congestive heart failure — a condition in which the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. • Recent vascular surgery. • The most common risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include: Type 2 diabetes. • High cholesterol levels. • High blood pressure. • Artery disease. • Smoking. • Obesity. • Older age.",
      "Complications": "If not treated promptly, acute mesenteric ischemia can lead to: Irreversible bowel damage. • Not getting enough blood flow to the bowel can cause parts of the bowel to die. • Sepsis. • This potentially life-threatening condition is caused by the body releasing chemicals into the bloodstream to fight infection. • In sepsis, the body overreacts to the chemicals, triggering changes that can lead to multiple organ failure. • Death. • Both of the above complications may lead to death. • People with chronic mesenteric ischemia can develop: Fear of eating. • This happens because of the after-meal pain associated with the condition. • Weight loss that isn't intended. • This can occur as a result of the fear of eating. • Acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia. • Symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia can get worse, leading to the acute form of the condition."

      "Symptoms": "Possible symptoms of mesenteric lymphadenitis include: Pain in the stomach area, often on the lower right side, but the pain can be more spread out. • General tenderness of the stomach area. • Fever. • Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. • Depending on what's causing the condition, symptoms also might include: Diarrhea. • Nausea and vomiting. • Pain in the stomach area is common in children and teens. • So it can be hard to know when to seek medical advice. • Call a healthcare professional right away for a child who has: Sudden, severe pain in the stomach area. • Stomach area pain with fever. • Stomach area pain with diarrhea or vomiting. • Tenderness to touch of the stomach area. • Bloody or maroon-colored stool. • Also, call a healthcare provider for a child who has pain in the stomach area that doesn't get better in a short time and who also: Has a change in bowel habits. • Has a loss of appetite. • Is not able to sleep.",
      "Causes": "The most common cause of mesenteric lymphadenitis is a viral infection, such as gastroenteritis. • Gastroenteritis is often called stomach flu. • This infection causes inflammation and swelling in the lymph nodes in the thin tissue that attaches the intestine to the back of the wall around the stomach area, called mesentery. • Other causes of mesenteric lymphadenitis include bacterial infection, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphoma.",
      "Risk factors": "Any infection that causes inflammation and swelling in the lymph nodes in the tissue that attaches the bowel to the abdominal wall increases the risk of mesenteric lymphadenitis. • Conditions that raise the risk of mesenteric lymphadenitis include: Viral or bacterial gastroenteritis. • Inflammatory bowel disease. • Lymphoma."

mesothelioma include: Being around asbestos. • If you've been directly exposed to asbestos fibers at work or at home, your risk of mesothelioma is increased. • Living with someone who works with asbestos. • People who work with asbestos may carry the fibers home on their skin and clothing. • Over many years, these fibers can put others in the home at risk of mesothelioma. • A family history of mesothelioma. • If your parent, sibling or child has mesothelioma, you may have a higher risk of this disease. • Radiation therapy to the chest. • If you had radiation therapy to your chest for cancer, you might have a higher risk of mesothelioma. • As pleural mesothelioma spreads in the chest, it puts pressure on the structures in that area. • This can cause complications such as: Trouble breathing. • Chest pain. • Trouble swallowing. • Pain caused by pressure on the nerves and spinal cord. • Buildup of fluid in the chest, called pleural effusion. • The fluid can press on the nearby

      "Overview": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a rare hereditary (genetic) disorder that causes fatty substances (lipids) to build up in cells, particularly in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. • This buildup is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme that helps break down lipids called sulfatides. • The brain and nervous system progressively lose function because the substance that covers and protects the nerve cells (myelin) is damaged. • There are three forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy, which involve different age ranges: late infantile form, juvenile form and adult form. • Signs and symptoms can vary. • The infantile form is the most common and progresses more rapidly than the other forms. • There is no cure for metachromatic leukodystrophy yet. • Depending on the form and age of onset, early identification and treatment may help manage some signs and symptoms and delay progression of the disorder.",
      "Symptoms": "Damage to the protective myelin covering the nerves results in progressive worsening of brain and nervous system functions, including: Loss of the ability to detect sensations, such as touch, pain, heat and sound Loss of intellectual, thinking and memory skills Loss of motor skills, such as walking, moving, speaking and swallowing Stiff, rigid muscles, poor muscle function and paralysis Loss of bladder and bowel function Gallbladder problems Blindness Hearing loss Seizures Emotional and behavioral problems, including unstable emotions and substance misuse Each form of metachromatic leukodystrophy occurs at a different age and can have different initial signs and symptoms and rates of progression: Late infantile form. • This is the most common form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, starting around 2 years of age or younger. • Progressive loss of speech and muscle function occurs rapidly. • Children with this form often do not survive beyond childhood. • Juvenile form. • This is the second most common form and starts in children between 3 and 16 years of age. • Early signs are behavior and cognitive problems and increasing difficulty in school. • Loss of the ability to walk may occur. • Although the juvenile form doesn't progress as fast as the late infantile form, survival is generally less than 20 years after symptoms begin. • Adult form. • This form is less common and typically starts after age 16. • Signs progress slowly and may begin with behavior and psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol misuse, and issues with school and work. • Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations may occur. • The course of this form varies, with periods of stable symptoms and periods of rapid decline in functioning. • Adults may survive for several decades after initial symptoms. • Talk to your doctor if you observe any signs listed above or if you have concerns about your own signs or symptoms.",
      "Causes": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal (mutated) gene. • The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. • The abnormal recessive gene is located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes). • To inherit an autosomal recessive disorder, both parents must be carriers, but they do not typically show signs of the condition. • The affected child inherits two copies of the abnormal gene — one from each parent. • The most common cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy is a mutation in the ARSA gene. • This mutation results in a lack of the enzyme that breaks down lipids called sulfatides that build up in the myelin. • Rarely, metachromatic leukodystrophy is caused by a deficiency in another kind of protein (activator protein) that breaks down sulfatides. • This is caused by a mutation in the PSAP gene. • The buildup of sulfatides is toxic, destroying the myelin-producing cells — also called white matter — that protect the nerves. • This results in damage to the function of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of microscopic colitis include: Watery diarrhea. • Belly pain, cramps or bloating. • Weight loss. • Nausea. • Not being able to control bowel movements, called fecal incontinence. • The body not having enough water, called dehydration. • The symptoms of microscopic colitis can come and go. • At times, symptoms improve on their own. • If you have watery diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, contact your healthcare professional to diagnose and treat your condition. • It's not clear what causes the swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the colon found in microscopic colitis. • Researchers believe that the causes may include: Medicines that can inflame the lining of the colon. • Bile acid not absorbed as it should be that inflames the lining of the colon. • Bacteria that make toxins or viruses that interact with the lining of the colon. • Autoimmune disease linked to microscopic colitis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease or psoriasis. • Autoimmune disease happens when the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues. • Risk factors for microscopic colitis include: Age. • Microscopic colitis is most common in people older than age 50. • Sex. • Women are more likely to have microscopic colitis than are men. • Some studies suggest a link between post-menopausal hormone therapy and microscopic colitis. • Autoimmune disease. • People with microscopic colitis sometimes also have an autoimmune disorder, such as celiac disease, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes or psoriasis. • Genetic link. • Research suggests that there may be a link between microscopic colitis and a family history of irritable bowel syndrome. • Smoking. • Recent research studies have shown a link between tobacco smoking and microscopic colitis, mostly in people ages 16 to 44. • Some research studies show a link between using certain medicines that may increase the risk of microscopic colitis. • But not all studies agree. • Medicines that may be linked to the condition include: Pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). • Proton pump inhibitors including lansoprazole (Prevacid), esomeprazole (Nexium), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), omeprazole (Prilosec) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). • Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline (Zoloft). • Acarbose. • Flutamide. • Ranitidine. • Carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol, others). • Clozapine (Clozaril, Versacloz). • Entacapone (Comtan). • Paroxetine (Paxil). • Simvastatin (Flolipid, Zocor). • Topiramate (Topamax, Qsymia, others). • There are minimal complications for most people once microscopic colitis is successfully treated. • The condition does not increase the risk of colon cancer.",

      "Overview": "A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. • It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. • Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so bad that it interferes with your daily activities. • For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. • An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking. • Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful. • The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help.",
      "Symptoms": "Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. • Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages. • One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including: Constipation. • Mood changes, from depression to euphoria. • Food cravings. • Neck stiffness. • Increased urination. • Fluid retention. • Frequent yawning. • For some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. • Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. • They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. • Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes. • Examples of migraine auras include: Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light. • Vision loss. • Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg. • Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body. • Difficulty speaking. • A migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. • How often migraines occur varies from person to person. • Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month. • During a migraine, you might have: Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides. • Pain that throbs or pulses. • Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch. • Nausea and vomiting. • After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day. • Some people report feeling elated. • Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly. • Migraines are often undiagnosed and untreated. • If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them. • Then make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your headaches. • Even if you have a history of headaches, see your health care provider if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different. • See your health care provider immediately or go to the emergency room if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which could indicate a more serious medical problem: An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap. • Headache with fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, double vision, numbness or weakness in any part of the body, which could be a sign of a stroke. • Headache after a head injury. • A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement. • New headache pain after age 50. • Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role. • Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved. • So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system. • Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines. • Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). • There are a number of migraine triggers, including: Hormonal changes in women. • Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women. • Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines. • Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications. • Drinks. • These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee. • Stress. • Stress at work or home can cause migraines. • Sensory stimuli. • Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds. • Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people. • Sleep changes. • Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people. • Physical strain. • Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines. • Weather changes. • A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine. • Medications. • Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines. • Foods. • Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines. • So might skipping meals. • Food additives. • These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods. • Several factors make you more prone to having migraines, including: Family history. • If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too. • Age. • Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence. • Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades. • Sex. • Women are three times more likely than men to have migraines. • Hormonal changes. • For women who have migraines, headaches might begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation. • They might also change during pregnancy or menopause. • Migraines generally improve after menopause. • Taking painkillers too often can trigger serious medication-overuse headaches. • The risk seems to be highest with aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and caffeine combinations. • Overuse headaches may also occur if you take aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for more than 14 days a month or triptans, sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) or rizatriptan (Maxalt) for more than nine days a month. • Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches. • You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.",

      "Overview": "Mild cognitive impairment is the in-between stage between typical thinking skills and dementia. • The condition causes memory loss and trouble with language and judgment, but it doesn't affect daily activities. • People with mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, may be aware that their memory or mental ability has changed. • Family and close friends also may notice changes. • But these changes aren't bad enough to impact daily life or affect usual activities. • MCI raises the risk of developing dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or other brain conditions. • But for some people with mild cognitive impairment, symptoms might never get worse or even get better.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, include trouble with memory, language and judgment. • The symptoms are more serious than the memory issues that are expected as people get older. • But the symptoms don't affect daily life at work or at home. • The brain, like the rest of the body, changes with age. • Many people notice they become more forgetful as they age. • It may take longer to think of a word or to recall a person's name. • But if concerns with memory go beyond what's expected, the symptoms may be due to mild cognitive impairment. • People with MCI may have symptoms that include: Forgetting things more often. • Missing appointments or social events. • Losing their train of thought. • Or not following the plot of a book or movie. • Trouble following a conversation. • Trouble finding the right word or with language. • Finding it hard to make decisions, finish a task or follow instructions. • Trouble finding their way around places they know well. • Poor judgment. • Changes that are noticed by family and friends. • People with MCI also may experience: Depression. • Anxiety. • A short temper and aggression. • A lack of interest. • Talk to your healthcare professional if you or someone close to you notices changes in memory or thinking. • This may include forgetting recent events or having trouble thinking clearly.",
      "Causes": "There's no single cause of mild cognitive impairment. • In some people, mild cognitive impairment is due to Alzheimer's disease. • But there's no single outcome. • Symptoms may remain stable for years or they may improve over time. • Or mild cognitive impairment may progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia or another type of dementia. • Mild cognitive impairment, also known as MCI, often involves the same types of brain changes seen in Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. • But in MCI, the changes occur at a lesser degree. • Some of these changes have been seen in autopsy studies of people with mild cognitive impairment. • These changes include: Clumps of beta-amyloid protein, called plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins that are seen in Alzheimer's disease. • Microscopic clumps of a protein called Lewy bodies. • These clumps are related to Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and, sometimes, Alzheimer's disease. • Small strokes or less blood flow through brain blood vessels. • Brain-imaging studies show that the following changes may be related to MCI: Decreased size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain important for memory. • Larger size of the brain's fluid-filled spaces, known as ventricles. • Reduced use of glucose in key brain areas. • Glucose is the sugar that is the main source of energy for cells.",
      "Risk factors": "The strongest risk factors for mild cognitive impairment are: Older age. • Having a form of a gene known as APOE e4. • This gene also is linked to Alzheimer's disease. • But having the gene doesn't guarantee a decline in thinking and memory. • Other medical conditions and lifestyle factors have been linked to a higher risk of changes in thinking, including: Diabetes. • Smoking. • High blood pressure. • High cholesterol, especially high levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL. • Obesity. • Depression. • Obstructive sleep apnea. • Hearing loss and vision loss that are not treated. • Traumatic brain injury. • Lack of physical exercise. • Low education level. • Lack of mentally or socially stimulating activities. • Exposure to air pollution.",
      "Complications": "Complications of mild cognitive impairment include a higher risk — but not a certainty — of dementia. • Overall, about 1% to 3% of older adults develop dementia every year. • Studies suggest that around 10% to 15% of people with mild cognitive impairment go on to develop dementia each year.",
      "Prevention": "Mild cognitive impairment can't be prevented. • But research has found that some lifestyle factors may lower the risk of getting it. • These steps may offer some protection: Don't drink large amounts of alcohol. • Limit exposure to air pollution. • Reduce your risk of a head injury, such as by wearing a helmet when riding a motorcycle or bicycle. • Don't smoke. • Manage health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and depression. • Watch your levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and get treatment if the levels are high. • Practice good sleep habits and manage any sleep conditions. • Eat a healthy diet full of nutrients. • Include fruits and vegetables and foods low in saturated fats. • Stay social with friends and family. • Get moderate to vigorous exercise most days of the week. • Wear a hearing aid if you have hearing loss. • Get regular eye exams and treat any vision changes. • Stimulate your mind with puzzles, games and memory training."

      "Overview": "Miscarriage is the sudden loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. • About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. • But the actual number is likely higher. • This is because many miscarriages happen early on, before people realize they're pregnant. • The term miscarriage might sound as if something was amiss in the carrying of the pregnancy. • This is rarely true. • Many miscarriages happen because the unborn baby does not develop properly. • Miscarriage is a somewhat common experience — but that doesn't make it any easier. • If you've lost a pregnancy, take a step toward emotional healing by learning more. • Understand what can cause a miscarriage, what raises the risk and what medical care might be needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Most miscarriages happen during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is about the first 13 weeks. • The symptoms can include: Bleeding from the vagina with or without pain, including light bleeding called spotting. • Pain or cramping in the pelvic area or lower back. • Fluid or tissue passing from the vagina. • Fast heartbeat. • If you have passed tissue from your vagina, place it in a clean container. • Then, bring it to your health care professional's office or the hospital. • A lab can examine the tissue to check for signs of a miscarriage. • Keep in mind that most pregnant people who have vaginal spotting or bleeding in the first trimester go on to have successful pregnancies. • But call your pregnancy care team right away if your bleeding is heavy or happens with cramping pain. • Most miscarriages happen because the unborn baby doesn't develop properly. • About half to two-thirds of miscarriages in the first trimester are linked with extra or missing chromosomes. • Chromosomes are structures in each cell that contain genes, the instructions for how people look and function. • When an egg and sperm unite, two sets of chromosomes — one from each parent — join together. • But if either set has fewer or more chromosomes than usual, that can lead to a miscarriage. • Chromosome conditions might lead to: Anembryonic pregnancy. • This happens when no embryo forms. • Or the embryo forms but is absorbed back into the body. • The embryo is the group of cells that develops into an unborn baby, also called a fetus. • Intrauterine fetal demise. • In this situation, an embryo forms but stops developing. • It dies before any symptoms of pregnancy loss occur. • Molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy. • With a molar pregnancy, a fetus doesn't develop. • This most often happens if both sets of chromosomes come from the sperm. • A molar pregnancy is linked with irregular growth of the placenta, the pregnancy-associated organ that gives an unborn baby oxygen and nutrients. • With a partial molar pregnancy, a fetus may develop, but it can't survive. • A partial molar pregnancy happens when there is an extra set of chromosomes, also called triploidy. • The extra set is often contributed from the sperm but can also be contributed from the egg. • Molar and partial molar pregnancies can't continue because they can cause serious health problems. • Sometimes, they can be linked with changes of the placenta that lead to cancer in the pregnant person. • In a few cases, having certain health conditions might lead to miscarriage. • Examples include: Uncontrolled diabetes. • Infections. • Hormonal problems. • Uterus or cervix problems. • Thyroid disease. • Obesity. • Routine activities such as these don't cause a miscarriage: Exercise, as long as you're healthy. • But talk with your pregnancy care team first. • And stay away from activities that could lead to injury, such as contact sports. • Sex. • Arguments. • Use of birth control pills before getting pregnant. • Working, as long as you're not exposed to high doses of harmful chemicals or radiation. • Talk with your health care professional if you're concerned about work-related risks. • Some people who've had a miscarriage blame themselves. • They think they lost the pregnancy because they fell, had a bad scare or other reasons. • But most of the time, miscarriage happens because of a random event that is no one's fault. • Various factors raise the risk of miscarriage, including: Age. • If you're older than age 35, you have a higher risk of miscarriage than a younger person. • At age 35, you have about a 20% risk. • At age 40, the risk is about 33% to 40%. • And at age 45, it ranges from 57% to 80%. • Past miscarriages. • If you've had one or more prior miscarriages before, you're at higher risk of pregnancy loss. • Long-term conditions. • If you have an ongoing health condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes, you have a higher risk of miscarriage. • Uterine or cervical problems. • Certain uterine conditions or weak cervical tissues, also called incompetent cervix, might raise the chances of a miscarriage. • Smoking, alcohol, caffeine and illegal drugs. • People who smoke have a greater risk of miscarriage than do nonsmokers. • Heavy use of caffeine or alcohol use also raises the risk. • So does using illegal drugs such as cocaine. • Weight. • Being underweight or being overweight has been linked with a higher risk of miscarriage. • Genetic conditions. • Sometimes, one of the partners may be healthy but carry a genetic problem that raises the risk of a miscarriage. • For example, one partner could have a unique chromosome that formed when the pieces of two different chromosomes attached to each other. • This is called translocation. • If either partner carries a chromosome translocation, passing it to an unborn child makes a miscarriage more likely. • Sometimes, pregnancy tissue that stays in the uterus after a miscarriage can lead to a uterine infection about 1 to 2 days later. • The infection is called a septic miscarriage. • Symptoms include: Fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit more than two times. • Chills. • Pain in the lower stomach area. • Foul-smelling fluid called discharge from the vagina. • Vaginal bleeding. • Call your health care professional's office or your local OB triage or emergency department if you have these symptoms. • The illness can get worse fast and become life-threatening without treatment. • Heavy bleeding from the vagina, called a hemorrhage, is another miscarriage complication. • Along with the bleeding, a hemorrhage often happens with symptoms such as: Fast heartbeat. • Dizziness from low blood pressure. • Tiredness or weakness due low red blood cells, also called anemia. • Get medical care at once. • Some people who have a hemorrhage need blood from a donor or surgery. • Often, there's nothing you can do to prevent a miscarriage. • Instead, focus on taking good care of yourself and your unborn baby: Get regular prenatal care while you're pregnant and right after you give birth. • Stay away from miscarriage risk factors — such as smoking, drinking alcohol and illegal drug use. • Take a daily multivitamin. • If you've had one or more prior miscarriages, ask your health care professional if you should take low-dose aspirin. • Limit caffeine. • Many experts recommend having no more than 200 milligrams per day while pregnant. • This is the amount of caffeine in a 12-ounce cup of brewed coffee. • Also, check food labels for amounts of caffeine. • The effects of caffeine aren't clear for your unborn baby and higher amounts may include miscarriage or preterm birth. • Ask your pregnancy care team what's right for you. • If you have a long-term health condition, work with your health care team to keep it under control.",

      "Overview": "Mitral valve disease is a problem with the valve located between the left heart chambers. • The upper left heart chamber is called the left atrium. • The bottom left heart chamber is called the left ventricle. • Mitral valve disease includes: Mitral valve regurgitation. • The mitral valve flaps, also called leaflets, may not close tightly. • This causes blood to leak backward. • Mitral valve stenosis. • The flaps of the mitral valve become thick or stiff, and they can fuse together. • This narrows the valve opening, which reduces blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. • Treatment for mitral valve disease depends on the severity of the condition and whether it is worsening. • Sometimes, surgery is recommended to repair or replace the mitral valve.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people with mitral valve disease might not have symptoms for many years, if at all. • Symptoms of mitral valve disease can include: Fatigue. • Irregular heartbeat. • Shortness of breath. • If you have symptoms of mitral valve disease, you may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.",
      "Causes": "To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. • The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. • Each valve has flaps, called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • If a valve doesn't open or close properly, blood flow through the heart to the body can be reduced. • In mitral valve regurgitation, the flaps don't close tightly. • Blood flows backward when the valve is closed, making it harder for the heart to work properly. • In mitral valve stenosis, the valve opening narrows. • The heart now must work harder to force blood through the smaller valve opening. • If the opening in the valve becomes small enough, it can reduce blood flow between the left heart chambers. • Mitral valve disease has many causes. • Some forms of mitral valve disease can be present at birth. • A heart problem that you're born with is called a congenital heart defect. • Mitral valve disease also may develop later in life. • This means it is acquired. • For example, mitral valve stenosis is often caused by rheumatic fever. • This fever is a complication of a strep infection that can affect the heart. • When this happens, it's called rheumatic mitral valve disease. • Other causes of acquired mitral valve disease include: Other heart conditions. • Infection. • Age-related changes. • Autoimmune disease, such as lupus.",
      "Risk factors": "Several things can increase the risk of mitral valve disease, including: Older age. • Certain infections that affect the heart. • Heart attack and some types of heart disease. • Use of certain drugs. • Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Radiation to the chest.",
      "Complications": "Mitral valve disease can cause many complications. • Severe mitral valve regurgitation, for example, causes the heart to work harder, which can cause the left ventricle to enlarge and the heart muscle to weaken. • Other complications of mitral valve disease may include: Irregular and often rapid heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. • High blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension. • Blood clots. • Congestive heart failure. • Stroke."

      "Overview": "Mitral valve regurgitation is the most common type of heart valve disease. • In this condition, the valve between the left heart chambers doesn't close fully. • Blood leaks backward across the valve. • If the leakage is severe, not enough blood moves through the heart or to the rest of the body. • Mitral valve regurgitation can make you feel very tired or short of breath. • Other names for mitral valve regurgitation are: Mitral regurgitation (MR). • Mitral insufficiency. • Mitral incompetence. • Treatment of mitral valve regurgitation may include regular health checkups, medicines or surgery. • You may not need treatment if the condition is mild. • Severe mitral valve regurgitation often requires a catheter procedure or heart surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve. • Without proper treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart rhythm problems or heart failure.",
      "Symptoms": "Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and develops slowly. • Some people do not have symptoms for many years. • But sometimes, mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly. • When this happens, it's called acute mitral valve regurgitation. • Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation. • Other symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include: Irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia. • Shortness of breath, especially when lying down. • Feelings of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. • Swollen feet or ankles. • If you have symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation, make an appointment for a health checkup. • You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. • To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. • The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. • Each valve has flaps, also called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • In mitral valve regurgitation, the valve flaps don't close tightly. • Blood moves backward when the valve is closed. • This makes it harder for the heart to work properly. • If mitral valve regurgitation is due to problems with the mitral valve, the condition is called primary mitral valve regurgitation. • If a problem or disease affecting other areas of the heart cause a leaky mitral valve, the condition is called functional or secondary mitral regurgitation. • Possible causes of mitral valve regurgitation include: Mitral valve prolapse. • In this condition, the mitral valve's flaps bulge back into the left upper heart chamber when the heart squeezes. • This common heart problem can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and cause blood to flow backward. • Rheumatic fever. • Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat. • Rheumatic fever can damage the mitral valve, leading to mitral valve regurgitation early or later in life. • If rheumatic fever causes mitral valve disease, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease. • Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States. • Heart attack. • A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve. • If there is a lot of heart attack damage, sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation can occur. • A leaky mitral valve caused by a heart attack is called ischemic mitral regurgitation. • Heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect. • Some people are born with heart structure problems, including damaged heart valves. • Thickening of the heart muscle, called cardiomyopathy. • Cardiomyopathy makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. • The condition can affect how the mitral valve works, causing regurgitation. • Types of cardiomyopathy linked to mitral valve regurgitation include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • Damaged tissue cords. • Over time, the pieces of tissue that hold the flaps of the mitral valve to the heart wall may stretch or tear. • This is especially likely in people with mitral valve prolapse. • A tear can cause blood to suddenly leak through the mitral valve. • It may require mitral valve repair surgery. • A chest injury also can cause rupture of the cords. • Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves, called endocarditis. • This condition is usually caused by an infection. • Germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. • Radiation therapy. • Rarely, radiation therapy for cancer that is focused on the chest area can lead to mitral valve regurgitation. • Several things can increase the risk of mitral valve regurgitation, including: Certain infections that affect the heart. • Heart attack. • Heart problems present at birth, called congenital heart defects. • History of other heart valve diseases, including mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve stenosis. • Older age. • Radiation to the chest. • Mitral valve regurgitation complications often depend on the severity of disease. • Mild mitral valve regurgitation usually does not cause any problems. • As mitral valve regurgitation gets worse, the heart must work harder to pump blood to the body. • The strain on the heart can cause the left lower chamber to widen. • The heart muscle may become weak. • Potential complications of severe mitral valve regurgitation include: An irregular and often rapid heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. • Mitral valve regurgitation may trigger this common heart rhythm disorder. • Atrial fibrillation has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots and stroke. • High blood pressure in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension. • Long-term untreated or improperly treated mitral regurgitation can increase pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. • As pressure rises, fluid builds up in the lungs. • Congestive heart failure. • In severe mitral valve regurgitation, the heart has to work harder to pump enough blood to the body. • The extra effort causes the left lower heart chamber

      "Overview": "Mitral valve stenosis — sometimes called mitral stenosis — is a narrowing of the valve between the two left heart chambers. • The narrowed valve reduces or blocks blood flow into the lower left heart chamber. • The lower left heart chamber is the heart's main pumping chamber. • It also is called the left ventricle. • Mitral valve stenosis can make you tired and short of breath. • Other symptoms may include irregular heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain or coughing up blood. • Some people don't notice symptoms. • Mitral valve stenosis can be caused by a complication of strep throat called rheumatic fever. • Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States. • Treatment for mitral valve stenosis may include medicine or mitral valve repair or replacement surgery. • Some people only need regular health checkups. • Treatment depends on how severe the valve disease is and whether it's getting worse. • Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to serious heart complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Mitral valve stenosis usually worsens slowly. • You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years. • Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age, even during childhood. • Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis include: Shortness of breath, especially with activity or when you lie down. • Fatigue, especially during increased activity. • Swollen feet or legs. • Pounding, skipping or otherwise irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Dizziness or fainting. • Fluid buildup in the lungs. • Chest discomfort or chest pain. • Coughing up blood. • Mitral valve stenosis symptoms may appear or get worse when the heart rate increases, such as during exercise. • Anything that puts stress on the body, including pregnancy or infections, may trigger symptoms. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional right away if you have chest pain, a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, or shortness of breath during activity. • Your healthcare professional may tell you to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. • If you have been diagnosed with mitral valve stenosis but haven't had symptoms, ask your healthcare team how often to have follow-up exams.",
      "Causes": "To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. • The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. • Each valve has flaps, called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • If a valve doesn't open or close properly, less blood may flow through the heart to the body. • In mitral valve stenosis, the valve opening narrows. • The heart now must work harder to force blood through the smaller valve opening. • Blood flow between the upper left and lower left heart chambers may decrease. • Causes of mitral valve stenosis include: Rheumatic fever. • This complication of strep throat is the most common cause of mitral valve stenosis. • When rheumatic fever damages the mitral valve, the condition is called rheumatic mitral valve disease. • Symptoms may not be seen until years to decades after rheumatic fever. • Calcium deposits. • As you age, calcium deposits can build up around the mitral valve. • This can cause narrowing of the structures that support the mitral valve flaps. • The condition is called mitral annular calcification, or MAC for short. • Severe MAC can cause mitral stenosis symptoms. • It's difficult to treat even with surgery. • People with calcium around the mitral valve often have similar problems with the heart's aortic valve. • Radiation therapy. • This is a treatment for certain types of cancer. • Radiation to the chest area can sometimes cause the mitral valve to thicken and harden. • The heart valve damage typically occurs 20 to 30 years after radiation therapy. • Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Rarely, some babies are born with a narrowed mitral valve. • Other health conditions. • Lupus and other autoimmune conditions may rarely cause mitral valve stenosis.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for mitral valve stenosis include: Untreated strep infections. • A history of untreated strep throat or rheumatic fever increases the risk of mitral valve stenosis. • However, rheumatic fever is rare in the United States. • But it's still a problem in developing nations. • Aging. • Older adults are at increased risk of calcium buildup around the mitral valve. • Radiation therapy. • Radiation causes changes in the mitral valve shape and structure. • Rarely, people who receive radiation therapy to the chest area for certain types of cancer may develop mitral valve stenosis. • Illicit drug use. • MDMA, short for methylenedioxymethamphetamine and commonly called molly or ecstasy, increases the risk of mitral valve disease. • Use of certain medicines. • Some migraine medicines have an ingredient called ergot alkaloids. • Ergotamine (Ergomar) is an example. • Ergot alkaloids may rarely cause heart valve scarring that leads to mitral stenosis. • Older weight-loss medicines that contained fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine also are linked to heart valve disease and other heart problems. • Fen-phen is an example. • It's no longer sold in the United States.",
      "Complications": "Mitral valve stenosis that is not treated can lead to complications such as: Irregular heartbeats. • Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias. • Mitral valve stenosis may cause an irregular and chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. • It's commonly known as AFib. • AFib is a common complication of mitral stenosis. • The risk increases with age and more-severe stenosis. • Blood clots. • Irregular heartbeats linked to mitral valve stenosis can cause blood clots to form in the heart. • If a blood clot from the heart travels to the brain, a stroke can occur. • High blood pressure in the lung arteries. • The medical name for this condition is pulmonary hypertension. • It can happen if a narrowed mitral valve slows or blocks blood flow. • Decreased blood flow raises pressure in the lung arteries. • The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. • Right-sided heart failure. • Changes in blood flow and high pressure in the lung arteries put a strain on the heart. • The heart must work harder to pump blood to the chambers on the right side of the heart. • The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail.",
      "Prevention": "Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of mitral valve stenosis. • So the best way to prevent mitral valve stenosis is to prevent rheumatic fever. • You can do this by making sure you and your children see a healthcare professional for sore throats. • Untreated strep throat infections can develop into rheumatic fever. • Strep throat is usually easily treated with antibiotics."

      "Overview": "Mittelschmerz is one-sided, lower abdominal pain associated with ovulation. • German for \"middle pain,\" mittelschmerz occurs midway through a menstrual cycle — about 14 days before your next menstrual period. • In most cases, mittelschmerz doesn't require medical attention. • For minor mittelschmerz discomfort, over-the-counter pain relievers and home remedies are often effective. • If your mittelschmerz pain is troublesome, your doctor may prescribe an oral contraceptive to stop ovulation and prevent midcycle pain.",
      "Symptoms": "Mittelschmerz pain usually lasts a few minutes to a few hours, but it may continue for as long as a day or two. • Pain from mittelschmerz may be: On one side of your lower abdomen Dull and achy, similar to menstrual cramps Sharp and sudden Accompanied by slight vaginal bleeding or discharge Rarely, severe Mittelschmerz pain occurs on the side of the ovary that's releasing an egg (ovulating). • The pain may switch sides every other month, or you may feel pain on the same side for several months. • Keep track of your menstrual cycle for several months and note when you feel lower abdominal pain. • If it occurs midcycle and goes away without treatment, it's most likely mittelschmerz. • Mittelschmerz rarely requires medical intervention. • However, contact your doctor if a new pelvic pain becomes severe, if it's accompanied by nausea or fever, or if it persists — any of which could indicate you have a condition more serious than mittelschmerz, such as appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or even an ectopic pregnancy. • Mittelschmerz occurs during ovulation, when the follicle ruptures and releases its egg. • Some women have mittelschmerz every month; others have it only occasionally. • The exact cause of mittelschmerz is unknown, but possible reasons for the pain include these: Just before an egg is released with ovulation, follicle growth stretches the surface of your ovary, causing pain. • Blood or fluid released from the ruptured follicle irritates the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum), leading to pain. • Pain at any other point in your menstrual cycle isn't mittelschmerz. • It may be normal menstrual cramping (dysmenorrhea) if it occurs during your period, or it may be from other abdominal or pelvic problems. • If you have severe pain, see your doctor. • Mittelschmerz has no clear risk factors. • But it may be more likely to happen between the ages of 15 and 25. • Mittelschmerz doesn't lead to other health conditions, also called complications. • The pain goes away on its own, or with medicine or home remedies. • Mittelschmerz can't be prevented. • It's linked with natural changes in the body that happen during the menstrual cycle.",

      "Overview": "A molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy. • It involves unusual growth of cells called trophoblasts. • These cells typically become the organ that feeds a growing fetus. • That organ also is known as the placenta. • There are two types of molar pregnancy — complete molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy. • In a complete molar pregnancy, the placental tissue swells and appears to form fluid-filled cysts. • There is no fetus. • In a partial molar pregnancy, the placenta might have both regular and irregular tissue. • There may be a fetus, but the fetus can't survive. • The fetus usually is miscarried early in the pregnancy. • A molar pregnancy can have serious complications, including a rare form of cancer. • A molar pregnancy requires early treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "A molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first. • But most molar pregnancies cause symptoms that can include: Dark brown to bright red bleeding from the vagina during the first three months Severe nausea and vomiting Sometimes grapelike cysts that pass from the vagina Pelvic pressure or pain Because of improved ways of detecting a molar pregnancy, most are found in the first trimester. • If it is not found in the first three months, symptoms of a molar pregnancy might include: A uterus growing quickly and being too large early in the pregnancy Preeclampsia — a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine — before 20 weeks of pregnancy Ovarian cysts Overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism",
      "Causes": "An egg fertilized atypically causes a molar pregnancy. • Human cells usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes. • In a typical fertilization, one chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. • In a complete molar pregnancy, one or two sperm fertilize an egg. • The chromosomes from the mother's egg are missing or don't work. • The father's chromosomes are copied. • There's none from the mother. • In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes are present, but the father supplies two sets of chromosomes. • The embryo then has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. • This most often occurs when two sperm fertilize an egg, resulting in an extra copy of the father's genes.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can contribute to a molar pregnancy include: Earlier molar pregnancy. • If you've had one molar pregnancy, you're more likely to have another. • A repeat molar pregnancy happens, on average, in 1 out of every 100 people. • Age of the mother. • A molar pregnancy is more likely in people older than age 43 or younger than age 15.",
      "Complications": "After removing a molar pregnancy, molar tissue might remain and continue to grow. • This is called persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). • GTN happens more often in complete molar pregnancies than it does in partial molar pregnancies. • One sign of persistent GTN is a high level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) — a pregnancy hormone — after the molar pregnancy has been removed. • In some cases, the mole that causes the molar pregnancy goes deep into the middle layer of the uterine wall. • This causes bleeding from the vagina. • Persistent GTN is usually treated with chemotherapy. • Another treatment possibility is removal of the uterus, also known as hysterectomy. • Rarely, a cancerous form of GTN known as choriocarcinoma develops and spreads to other organs. • Choriocarcinoma is usually successfully treated with chemotherapy. • A complete molar pregnancy is more likely to have this complication than is a partial molar pregnancy.",
      "Prevention": "If you've had a molar pregnancy, talk to your pregnancy care provider before trying to get pregnant again. • You might want to wait six months to one year. • The risk of having another molar pregnancy is low, but it's higher once you've had a molar pregnancy. • During future pregnancies, a care provider may do early ultrasounds to check your condition and make sure the baby is developing."

      "Overview": "Moles, also known as nevi, are a common type of skin growth. • They often appear as small, dark brown spots that are caused by clusters of pigment-forming cells called melanocytes. • Most people have 10 to 45 moles that appear during childhood and the teenage years. • How these moles look may change over time. • They also may fade over time. • Most moles are harmless. • Rarely, they become cancerous. • Being aware of changes in your moles and other pigmented patches is important to finding skin cancer, especially malignant melanoma.",
      "Symptoms": "The typical mole is a small brown spot. • But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes: Color and texture. • Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. • They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. • They may have hair growing from them. • Shape. • Most moles are oval or round. • Size. • Moles are typically less than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. • Those present at birth, known as congenital nevi, can be bigger and cover part of the face, trunk or a limb. • Moles can grow anywhere on your body, including your scalp and armpits, as well as under your nails and between your fingers and toes. • Most people have 10 to 45 moles. • Many of these moles occur by age 40. • Moles may change or fade away over time. • They may become darker and larger with hormonal changes that occur during the teenage years and while pregnant. • Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis that is noncancerous and appears as waxy brown, black or tan growths. • They aren't clusters of pigment-forming cells, known as nevi. • Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. • These lesions don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated as a cosmetic concern. • A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape, or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. • This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: A is for asymmetrical shape. • One half is unlike the other half. • B is for border. • Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. • C is for changes in color. • Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. • D is for diameter. • Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 mm). • E is for evolving. • Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. • Also, new symptoms can arise, such as itchiness or bleeding. • Cancerous moles, also known as malignant moles, vary greatly in how they look. • Some may show all of the changes listed above. • Others may have only one or two unusual traits. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if a mole looks unusual, grows or otherwise changes. • Moles are caused when cells in the skin called melanocytes grow in clusters. • Melanocytes generally are distributed throughout the skin. • They produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color. • Melanoma is the main complication of moles. • Some people have an above-average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and leading to melanoma. • Factors that raise melanoma risk include: Being born with large moles. • These type of moles are called congenital nevi. • They are subclassified based on their estimated adult size. • Large and giant congenital nevi that are more than 20 centimeters in diameter are at higher risk of developing melanoma. • Having unusual moles. • Moles that are large with an irregular border are known as atypical nevi, also known as dysplastic nevi. • They tend to run in families. • Having many moles. • Having more than 50 moles suggests a greater risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer. • Having a personal or family history of melanoma. • If you've had melanoma before, there is a higher risk of getting melanoma again. • Also, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma. • Using tanning lamps or beds. • Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays and can raise your risk of skin cancer. • The following measures can help limit the growth of moles and the main complication of moles: melanoma. • Become familiar with the location and pattern of your moles. • Regularly look at your skin for changes that may signal melanoma. • Do self-exams of the skin monthly. • With the help of mirrors, do a head-to-toe check, including: Scalp. • Palms and fingernails. • Armpits. • Chest. • Legs. • Feet, including the soles and between the toes. • Genital area and between the buttocks. • Talk with your healthcare professional about your risk factors for melanoma and whether you need a professional skin exam regularly. • Take measures to protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as from the sun or tanning beds. • UV radiation has been linked to a higher melanoma risk. • And children who haven't been protected from sun exposure tend to grow more moles. • Stay out of the sun during peak times. • For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. • Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even on cloudy days or during the winter. • When you are outdoors, seek shade or use an umbrella to protect yourself from the sun. • Use sunscreen year-round. • Apply sunscreen to dry skin about 15 minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days. • Use a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. • Apply it generously and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Wear protective clothing. • Sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves and other clothing can protect you from damaging UV rays. • You also might want to think about clothing that's made with fabric specially treated to block UV radiation. • Don't use tanning lamps or beds. • Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays that can raise your risk of skin cancer.",
      "Causes": "Moles are caused when cells in the skin called melanocytes grow in clusters. • Melanocytes generally are distributed throughout the skin. • They produce melanin, the natural pigment that gives skin its color.",
      "Complications": "Melanoma is the main complication of moles. • Some people have an above-average risk of their moles becoming cancerous and leading to melanoma. • Factors that raise melanoma risk include: Being born with large moles. • These type of moles are called congenital nevi. • They are subclassified based on their estimated adult size. • Large and giant congenital nevi that are more than 20 centimeters in diameter are at higher risk of developing melanoma. • Having unusual moles. • Moles that are large with an irregular border are known as atypical nevi, also known as dysplastic nevi. • They tend to run in families. • Having many moles. • Having more than 50 moles suggests a greater risk of melanoma and possibly breast cancer. • Having a personal or family history of melanoma. • If you've had melanoma before, there is a higher risk of getting melanoma again. • Also, some types of atypical nevi lead to a genetic form of melanoma. • Using tanning lamps or beds. • Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays and can raise your risk of skin cancer.",
      "Prevention": "The following measures can help limit the growth of moles and the main complication of moles: melanoma. • Become familiar with the location and pattern of your moles. • Regularly look at your skin for changes that may signal melanoma. • Do self-exams of the skin monthly. • With the help of mirrors, do a head-to-toe check, including: Scalp. • Palms and fingernails. • Armpits. • Chest. • Legs. • Feet, including the soles and between the toes. • Genital area and between the buttocks. • Talk with your healthcare professional about your risk factors for melanoma and whether you need a professional skin exam regularly. • Take measures to protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as from the sun or tanning beds. • UV radiation has been linked to a higher melanoma risk. • And children who haven't been protected from sun exposure tend to grow more moles. • Stay out of the sun during peak times. • For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. • Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even on cloudy days or during the winter. • When you are outdoors, seek shade or use an umbrella to protect yourself from the sun. • Use sunscreen year-round. • Apply sunscreen to dry skin about 15 minutes before going outdoors, even on cloudy days. • Use a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. • Apply it generously and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Wear protective clothing. • Sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, long sleeves and other clothing can protect you from damaging UV rays. • You also might want to think about clothing that's made with fabric specially treated to block UV radiation. • Don't use tanning lamps or beds. • Tanning lamps and beds release UV rays that can raise your risk of skin cancer."

      "Overview": "Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which an atypical protein is found in the blood. • The protein is called monoclonal protein or M protein. • This protein is made in the soft, blood-producing tissue in the center of bones. • This blood-producing tissue is bone marrow. • Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance occurs most often in older men. • MGUS usually causes no problems. • But sometimes it can lead to more-serious diseases. • These include some forms of blood cancer. • People who have high amounts of this protein in the blood need regular checkups. • That's so they can get earlier treatment if the condition gets worse. • If it doesn't get worse, MGUS doesn't need treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "People with monoclonal gammopathy often don't have symptoms. • Some people have a rash or nerve problems, such as numbness or tingling. • A blood test for another condition might find MGUS by chance.",
      "Causes": "Experts don't know what causes MGUS. • Changes in genes and being around certain chemicals, such as those used to kill pests, appear to play a role.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase your risk of developing MGUS include: Age. • The average age at diagnosis is 70 years. • Race. • Africans and Black Americans are more likely to get MGUS than white people are. • Sex. • MGUS is more common in men. • Family history. • Having family members with MGUS might increase the risk.",
      "Complications": "Each year, about 1% of people with MGUS get certain types of blood cancers or other serious diseases, such as: Multiple myeloma. • Light chain amyloidosis. • Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. • Lymphoma. • Other issues linked to MGUS include broken bones, blood clots, kidney problems, and damage to nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, also known as peripheral neuropathy."

      "Overview": "Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, affect people emotionally. • If you have depression, you may constantly feel sad. • You also may be anxious. • If you have bipolar disorder, you'll likely have extreme mood swings. • Your feelings may range from being very sad, empty or cranky to being very happy — going back and forth between each mood. • Mood disorders are more common in women. • Having a mood disorder may raise your risk of suicide. • This risk is higher if the mood disorder is serious and you also have problems with alcohol or drugs. • If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for help. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. • It's available 24 hours a day, every day. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and private. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish-language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • Mood disorders are divided into two major groups: depressive disorders and bipolar disorders. • Each group includes several different types. • Depressive disorders cause loss of pleasure in most or all activities and ultimately affect your quality of life. • You could have less energy, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite and lack interest. • You also could have feelings of worthlessness or guilt and be in pain and tired. • Types of depressive disorders include: Major depression — typically lasts for at least two weeks and often longer than four weeks. • Seasonal affective disorder — occurs at certain times of the year, typically with a change of season. • Persistent depressive disorder — a long-term form of depression that causes feelings of sadness, emptiness and often hopelessness. • Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder — a diagnosis used for children and teenagers. • It features constant, serious and lasting testiness with frequent temper outbursts that are not consistent with the age of the child. • Premenstrual dysphoric disorder — features mood changes, hopelessness and feelings of being overwhelmed or out of control. • These symptoms occur in the 10 days before a menstrual period and go away within a few days after a period begins. • Depression related to a medical condition — features a great loss of pleasure in most or all activities due to the physical effects of another medical health problem. • Depression related to substance or medicine use — features depression symptoms that start during or soon after using a street drug or medicine, or after withdrawal from these substances. • Bipolar disorders feature mood swings that include emotional highs called manic or hypomanic episodes, and lows, called depressive episodes. • These highs and lows are usually continuous. • But they also can change from high to low or low to high — or shift into a normal mood. • Sometimes both the highs and lows might occur together. • This is called a mixed episode. • You could be easily distracted and have racing thoughts. • Your sleep also could be affected. • Types include: Bipolar I disorder — features a constantly elevated mood that lasts for at least one week. • This is called a manic episode. • It affects your overall ability to function and makes it more likely that you'll take part in risky behavior. • Bipolar II disorder — features constantly elevated moods — called hypomanias — that last at least four days and less than one week. • There may be risky behaviors, but usually hypomania does not greatly affect your ability to function. • But other people should be able to notice that something is different about you. • Cyclothymia — features shifts from emotional highs to emotional lows that can affect your ability to function. • The emotional ups and downs are not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder. • Bipolar related to a medical condition — features symptoms that are the same as bipolar disorder, but they can be due to a medical condition. • For example, Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and traumatic brain injury can cause bipolar mania or hypomania. • Bipolar related to the use of certain substances — features symptoms that are the same as bipolar disorder, but they can be due to alcohol, street drugs or medicine.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of mood disorder. • Depressive disorders are common and often long-lasting. • They can: Cause you to feel sad, empty, anxious and cranky. • Affect your ability to focus and function. • Cause loss of pleasure in most or all activities. • Affect your energy level and quality of life. • Make you feel worthless or guilty. • Affect how much you eat and sleep. • Raise thoughts about suicide. • Bipolar disorders may feature: Moods that go back and forth between emotional highs, called mania or hypomania, and lows, called depression. • Feeling on top of the world, superior to others, or that you're so strong that nothing can harm or change you. • Racing thoughts. • Increased energy. • Disrupted sleep, usually a decreased need for sleep, but a continued high energy level. • Impulsive behaviors. • You also could be easily distracted and more likely to think about suicide or plan for suicide, depending on the seriousness of symptoms. • Other types of mood disorders may include other symptoms. • If you're concerned that you may have a mood disorder, see your doctor or a mental health professional as soon as you can. • If you're not sure you want to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. • Talk to a health care professional if you: Feel like your emotions are getting in the way of work, how you get along with others or other areas of your life, or you're not taking part in social activities. • Have trouble with alcohol or drugs. • Are thinking about taking your own life. • If this is the case, seek emergency treatment at once. • Your mood disorder is not likely to go away on its own. • And it may get worse over time. • Get professional help before your mood disorder becomes serious. • It may be easier to treat early on. • Mood disorders are caused by traits passed down to you, as well as environmental factors and life events. • Environmental factors can include, for example, childhood experiences and stressful life events. • Some prescription drugs, such as corticosteroids and medicines for Parkinson's disease, and street drugs also can cause mood disorders. • Risk factors include life experiences and stressful life events that increase the risk of certain types of mood disorders. • Mood disorders may occur along with neurological disorders. • These are conditions that affect the brain and the nervous system. • For example, depression is common among people with multiple sclerosis, dementia, traumatic brain injury, stroke and epilepsy. • Depression also often occurs in people who have movements disorders like Parkinson's disease and those who have other long-term health conditions.",

      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. • They include: Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. • The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. • It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. • It is possible for morphea to recur. • See your doctor if you notice reddish patches of hardening or thickening skin. • Early diagnosis and treatment may help slow the development of new patches and allow your doctor to identify and treat complications before they worsen.",
      "Causes": "The cause of morphea is unknown. • It may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. • In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy. • The condition isn't contagious.",
      "Risk factors": "Certain factors may affect your risk of developing morphea, including: Being white and female. • Morphea is most common in white females. • Age. • The condition can affect people at any age. • It usually appears between the ages of 2 and 14 or in the mid-40s. • A family history of morphea. • This condition can run in families. • People with morphea are more likely to have a family history of morphea and other autoimmune diseases.",
      "Complications": "Morphea can cause a number of complications, including: Self-esteem issues. • Morphea can have a negative effect on your self-esteem and body image, particularly if discolored patches of skin appear on your arms, legs or face. • Movement problems. • Morphea that affects the arms or legs can impair joint mobility. • Widespread areas of hardened, discolored skin. • Numerous new patches of hardened, discolored skin may seem to join together, a condition known as generalized morphea. • Loss of hair and sweat glands. • Over time, you may lose hair and sweat glands in the affected area. • Eye damage. • Children with head and neck morphea may experience unnoticeable but permanent eye damage."

      "Overview": "Mosquito bites are the itchy bumps that form on the skin after mosquitoes feed on your blood. • The bumps usually go away without treatment in a few days. • Some mosquito bites may get very swollen, sore and inflamed. • This type of reaction, sometimes called skeeter syndrome, is most common in children. • Mosquito bites can cause severe illnesses if the insects carry certain viruses or parasites. • Infected mosquitoes can spread West Nile virus, Zika virus, and the viruses that cause malaria, yellow fever and some types of brain infection.",
      "Symptoms": "Mosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren't covered by clothing. • Symptoms include: An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite A painful spot that looks like a hive and forms within 24 hours after a bite Small blisters A severe reaction to mosquito bites can cause: A large, swollen, inflamed area A hive-like rash Swelling around the eyes Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults. • Contact your health care provider if the mosquito bites seem to occur with warning signs of a serious condition. • These might include a high fever, severe headache, body aches and signs of infection.",
      "Causes": "Mosquito bites are caused by female mosquitoes feeding on your blood. • As a biting mosquito fills itself with blood, it injects saliva into your skin. • The saliva triggers an immune system reaction that results in the classic itching and bump. • Mosquitoes are attracted to smells, such as from sweat, floral scents and exhaled carbon dioxide.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for mosquito bites include: Sweating Wearing floral scents Living in an area where mosquitoes are active Spending time outside without using mosquito repellent",
      "Complications": "Scratching bites can lead to infection. • Mosquitoes can carry the viruses that cause certain diseases, such as West Nile virus and the viruses that cause malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever. • The mosquito gets a virus or parasite by biting an infected person or animal. • Then when it's biting you, the mosquito can transfer that virus or parasite to you through its saliva. • West Nile, dengue fever and some types of encephalitis occur in the United States. • Other diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, are far more common in tropical areas of the world.",
      "Prevention": "Mosquitos bite during both day and night, and they can live indoors. • You can take several steps to protect yourself from mosquito bites. • Limit exposure to mosquitoes by: Repairing any tears in the screens on windows, doors and camping gear Using mosquito netting over strollers and cribs Using mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors Selecting self-care products that don't have scents Use insect repellent when mosquitoes are active. • The most effective insect repellents in the United States include one of these active ingredients: DEET Icaridin, also called picaridin Oil of lemon eucalyptus IR3535 Para-menthane-diol (PMD) 2-Undecanone These ingredients temporarily repel mosquitoes and ticks. • DEET may offer longer lasting protection. • Whichever product you choose, read the label before you apply it. • If you're using a spray repellent, apply it outdoors and away from food. • You may need to reapply it 6 to 8 hours later if you're still in an area where mosquitoes are active. • If you're also using sunscreen, put it on first, about 20 minutes before applying the repellent. • Avoid products that have both sunscreen and repellent, because you'll likely need to reapply sunscreen more often than repellent. • And it's best to use only as much repellent as you need and to wash your hands after applying it. • Used according to package directions, these products are generally safe for children and adults, with a few exceptions: Don't use DEET-containing products on infants younger than 2 months. • Don't use icaridin on infants younger than 6 months. • Check the labels of products with oil of lemon eucalyptus — some aren't suitable for children under 3 years old. • Don't use para-menthane-diol on children under 3 years old. • Don't let young children get insect repellent on their hands, as they might get it in their mouths. • Don't apply repellent near the eyes and mouth. • Don't apply repellent under clothing. • Don't apply repellent over sunburns, cuts, wounds or rashes. • When the risk of mosquito bites has passed, wash repellent off the skin with soap and water. • Permethrin is an insecticide and insect repellent used for added protection. • This product is made to use on clothing and outdoor gear, not skin. • Check the product label for instructions. • Some sporting goods stores sell clothing pretreated with permethrin. • Don't wash bed nets or set them in sunlight, as this breaks down permethrin. • Clothing sprayed with permethrin can offer protection for two washings and up to two weeks. • Weather permitting, wear a hat, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. • Get vaccinations or take preventive medicine that your health care provider has suggested. • Think about whether you tend to have large or severe reactions to mosquito bites — skeeter syndrome. • You might want to take a nondrowsy, nonprescription antihistamine when you know you'll be exposed to mosquitoes. • Get rid of standing water, which mosquitoes need to breed. • Take these steps to keep your house and yard free of mosquito pools: Unclog roof gutters. • Empty children's wading pools at least once a week, and preferably more often. • Change water in birdbaths at least weekly. • Get rid of old tires in your yard. • Empty outdoor flower pots regularly or store them upside down so that they can't collect water. • Drain your fire pit if water collects there."

      "Overview": "Movement disorders are a group of nervous system conditions that affect movement. • They can cause either increased movements or reduced or slow movements. • These movements may be under the person's control, known as voluntary. • Or the movements may not be under the person's control, known as involuntary. • There are many types of movement disorders that cause different symptoms. • For example, dystonia causes muscle contractions that lead to twisting of the body. • Another movement disorder called chorea causes brief periods of quick involuntary movements that happen over and over. • Parkinsonism causes slowness of movement with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. • Treatments may be available to help manage the symptoms of movement disorders. • Depending on the type of movement disorder, medicines, therapies or surgeries may be available. • If a condition causes the movement disorder, treating the condition may help improve symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of movement disorders vary depending on the type of the disorder. • Common types of movement disorders and their symptoms include: Ataxia. • Ataxia affects the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement. • Ataxia may cause clumsy movements of the arms and legs, and a loss of balance. • Ataxia also can change a person's speech and cause other symptoms. • There are many causes of ataxia, including genetic and degenerative conditions. • Ataxia also may be caused by an infection or another treatable condition. • Chorea. • Chorea causes brief, irregular, somewhat rapid, involuntary movements that happen over and over. • The movements typically involve the face, mouth, trunk, arm and leg. • Chorea can look like exaggerated fidgeting. • The most common genetic chorea is Huntington's disease. • This disease is passed down from a parent and gets worse over time. • It can be confirmed with genetic testing. • Huntington's disease has three types of symptoms. • They include movements that can't be controlled, trouble with thinking and mental health conditions. • Dystonia. • This condition involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, irregular postures, or movements that occur again and again. • Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body. • The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. • In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. • This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. • The head also may shake, known as a tremor. • Functional movement disorder. • This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. • But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. • Functional movement disorders are treatable. • Multiple system atrophy. • This rare condition affects many brain systems and gets worse over time. • Multiple system atrophy causes a movement disorder, such as ataxia or parkinsonism. • It also can cause low blood pressure, bladder symptoms and acting out dreams. • Myoclonus. • Myoclonus are very quick jerks of a muscle. • Parkinson's disease. • Parkinson's disease causes tremors, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or loss of balance. • It also can cause symptoms not related to movement. • These symptoms include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, acting out dreams and a decline in thinking skills. • Parkinson's disease slowly gets worse over time. • Parkinsonism. • Parkinsonism is a general term for slowness of movement along with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. • There are many different causes. • Parkinson's disease and certain dopamine blocking medicines are the most common causes. • Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. • Stroke or repeated head trauma also can cause parkinsonism. • Progressive supranuclear palsy. • This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. • It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition. • Restless legs syndrome. • This movement disorder causes aching, itching, or creeping feelings in the legs while relaxing or lying down. • The feeling often goes away with movement. • Tardive dyskinesia. • This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. • It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). • Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. • Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements. • Tourette syndrome. • This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. • Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. • Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years. • Tremor. • This movement disorder causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, such as the hands, head or other body parts. • The most common type is essential tremor.",
      "Causes": "A wide variety of factors can cause movement disorders, including: Genetics. • Some types of movement disorders can be caused by an altered gene. • The altered gene is passed down from a parent to a child. • This is called an inherited condition. • Huntington's disease and Wilson's disease are two movement disorders that can be inherited. • Medicines. • Medicines such as anti-seizure and anti-psychotic medicines can lead to movement disorders. • Illegal drugs or large amounts of alcohol. • Illegal drugs such as cocaine can cause movement disorders such as chorea. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol can cause chorea or ataxia. • Not getting enough of certain vitamins. • Having low levels of certain vitamins in the body, known as a vitamin deficiency, can cause movement disorders. • A deficiency in vitamin B-1, vitamin B-12 or vitamin E can lead to ataxia. • Medical conditions. • Thyroid conditions, multiple sclerosis, stroke, viral encephalitis and several others can cause movement disorders. • Brain tumors also can lead to movement disorders. • Head injury. • Head trauma from an injury can lead to movement disorders. • For most people with a movement disorders, there is no known cause. • When healthcare professionals haven't found the exact cause, it's called idiopathic.",
      "Risk factors": "Your risk of some movement disorders is higher if you have a parent with the condition. • Movement disorders that can be passed down through families include essential tremor, Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease and Tourette syndrome. • Other factors that may increase the risk of having a movement disorder include having certain medical conditions or taking certain medicines. • Drinking large amount of alcohol, doing illegal drugs such as cocaine or not having enough of certain vitamins in the body also can increase risk."

      "Overview": "Moyamoya disease is a rare blood vessel condition in which the carotid artery in the skull becomes blocked or narrowed. • The carotid artery is a major artery that brings blood to the brain. • When it's blocked, blood flow to the brain is reduced. • Tiny blood vessels then form at the base of the brain to supply the brain with blood. • The condition may cause a ministroke, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a stroke. • It also can cause bleeding in the brain. • Moyamoya disease can affect how well the brain functions and can cause cognitive and developmental delays or disability. • Moyamoya disease most commonly affects children. • However, adults may have the condition as well. • Moyamoya disease is found all over the world. • But it's more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China. • This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations.",
      "Symptoms": "Moyamoya disease may happen at any age. • But symptoms are most common in children between ages 5 and 10 and in adults between ages 30 and 50. • Spotting symptoms early is very important to prevent complications such as a stroke. • Moyamoya disease causes different symptoms in adults and children. • In children, the first symptom is usually a stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack, also called TIA. • Adults may experience these symptoms, as well. • But adults also may experience bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. • The bleeding happens because of the way blood vessels in the brain formed. • Symptoms of moyamoya disease related to reduced blood flow to the brain include: Headache. • Seizures. • Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. • This is typically on one side of the body. • Vision problems. • Trouble speaking or understanding others, known as aphasia. • Cognitive or developmental delays. • Involuntary movements. • These symptoms can be triggered by exercise, crying, coughing, straining or a fever. • See your healthcare professional if you have any of the symptoms of moyamoya disease. • Early detection and treatment can help prevent a stroke and serious complications. • Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a stroke or ministroke, even if the symptoms seem to come and go or disappear. • To check for signs of stroke, think \"FAST\" and do the following: Face. • Ask the person to smile. • Does one side of the face droop? Arms. • Ask the person to raise both arms. • Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise up? Speech. • Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. • Is the person's speech slurred or strange? Time. • If you observe any of these signs, call 911 or emergency medical help right away. • Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. • Every minute counts. • The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. • If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of moyamoya disease isn't known. • Moyamoya disease is most commonly seen in Japan, Korea and China. • But it also happens in other parts of the world. • Because moyamoya disease is most common in these Asian countries, researchers believe this strongly suggests a genetic factor in some populations. • Sometimes changes to the blood vessels, known as vascular changes, can happen that mimic moyamoya disease. • These changes may have different causes and symptoms. • This is known as moyamoya syndrome. • Moyamoya syndrome can be linked to certain conditions, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, neurofibromatosis type 1 and hyperthyroidism.",
      "Risk factors": "Though the cause of moyamoya disease is not known, certain factors may increase your risk of having the condition. • They include: Asian heritage. • Although moyamoya disease is found all over the world, it's more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China. • This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations. • People with Asian heritage living in Western countries also have a higher risk of moyamoya disease. • Family history of moyamoya disease. • If you have a family member with moyamoya disease, your risk of having the condition is 30 to 40 times higher than that of the general population. • This strongly suggests a genetic link. • Medical conditions. • Moyamoya syndrome sometimes happens with other disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1, sickle cell disease and Down syndrome, among many others. • Being female. • Moyamoya disease is slightly more common in females. • Being young. • Though adults can have moyamoya disease, children younger than 15 years old are most commonly affected.",
      "Complications": "Most complications from moyamoya disease are linked to the effects of strokes. • They include seizures, paralysis and vision problems. • Other complications include speech problems, movement disorders and developmental delays. • Moyamoya disease can cause serious and permanent damage to the brain.",

      "Causes": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is caused by a change in the MEN1 gene. • That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin. • Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly. • Many different changes in the MEN1 gene can cause the MEN 1 condition to develop. • People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children. • Many people with a change in the MEN1 gene inherit it from a parent. • But some people are the first in their family to have a new MEN1 gene change that doesn't come from a parent.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) include the following: Children with a parent who has a genetic change in the MEN1 gene are at risk of the MEN 1 condition. • That's because these children have a 50% chance of having the same genetic change that causes MEN 1. • Parents and siblings of people who have a change in the MEN1 gene also are at risk. • That's because they may have the same genetic change, even if they haven't had any symptoms of MEN 1."

      "Causes": "MEN 2 is an inherited condition. • This means someone who has a changed gene that can cause MEN 2 can pass that gene on to their children. • Many people also may be the first person in their families to have this disorder. • People diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer are screened regularly for MEN 2.",
      "Complications": "MEN 2 can cause the parathyroid glands to put too much calcium into the blood. • This is known as primary hyperparathyroidism. • The parathyroid glands are located in your neck. • The extra calcium in the blood can cause many issues, including weak bones, called osteoporosis, kidney stones and having to urinate a lot. • Medullary thyroid cancer shows up as a lump on the thyroid or neck. • It can be hard to swallow when the tumor is large or other symptoms if the cancer spreads outside the neck. • People with MEN 2 also can have a condition called pheochromocytoma. • This condition causes noncancerous tumors on an adrenal gland. • The adrenal glands are located at the top of the kidneys. • These tumors can release hormones that cause high blood pressure, sweating and other symptoms.",
      "Prevention": "Genetic testing is used to find out if someone has a changed gene that causes MEN 2. • Children of someone who has this changed gene could inherit it and develop MEN 2. • Parents and siblings also could have the changed gene even if they don't have symptoms. • If someone in your family is diagnosed with MEN 2, your health care provider will likely recommend you and your family members have genetic testing. • This is because MEN 2 can be treated or managed by removing the thyroid gland early in life. • Being screened for parathyroid or adrenal tumors also can help. • If no gene changes are found in family members, usually no other screening tests are needed. • However, genetic testing doesn't find all MEN 2 gene changes. • If MEN 2 isn't found in people who may have it, they and their family members will have regular blood and imaging tests over time to check for signs of the disease."

      "Overview": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes breakdown of the protective covering of nerves. • Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. • It's also known as MS. • In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. • This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. • Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers. • Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. • Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. • Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. • The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS. • There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. • However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. • Some conditions are classified as stages, but multiple sclerosis is classified as types. • MS types depend on the progression of symptoms and frequency of relapses. • Types of MS include: Most people with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing-remitting type. • They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. • These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. • At least 20% to 40% of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms. • This progression may come with or without periods of remission and happens within 10 to 40 years of disease onset. • This is known as secondary-progressive MS. • The worsening of symptoms usually includes trouble with mobility and walking. • The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. • Some people with multiple sclerosis experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. • This type of MS is known as primary-progressive MS. • Clinically isolated syndrome refers to the first episode of a condition that affects the myelin. • After further testing, clinically isolated syndrome may be diagnosed as MS or a different condition. • Radiologically isolated syndrome refers to findings on MRIs of the brain and spinal cord that look like MS in someone without classic symptoms of MS.",
      "Symptoms": "Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. • Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. • Common symptoms include: Numbness or tingling. • Electric-shock sensations that happen with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward. • This sensation is called Lhermitte sign. • Lack of coordination. • Trouble with walking or not being able to walk at all. • Weakness. • Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time. • Vision loss often happens with pain during eye movement. • Double vision. • Blurry vision. • Dizziness and a false sense that you or your surroundings are moving, known as vertigo. • Trouble with sexual, bowel and bladder function. • Fatigue. • Slurred speech. • Troubles with memory, thinking and understanding information. • Mood changes. • Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen symptoms of MS. • These aren't considered true disease relapses but pseudorelapses. • Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. • The cause of multiple sclerosis is not known. • It's considered an immune-mediated disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. • In MS, the immune system attacks and destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. • This fatty substance is called myelin. • Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. • When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages traveling along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked. • It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. • A combination of genetics and environmental factors may increase the risk of MS. • Factors that increase the risk of multiple sclerosis include: Age. • MS can happen at any age. • However, onset most commonly happens between 20 and 40 years of age. • Sex. • Women are 2 to 3 times more likely than men to have relapsing-remitting MS. • Family history. • If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease. • Certain infections. • A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr. • Epstein-Barr is the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis. • Race. • People with white skin, particularly those of Northern European descent, have the highest risk of developing MS. • People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk. • A recent study suggests that the number of Black and Hispanic young adults with multiple sclerosis may be greater than previously thought. • Climate. • MS is far more common in places with temperate climates. • These include Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. • Vitamin D. • Having low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight is linked to a greater risk of MS. • Your birth month also may affect the chances of developing MS. • This has to do with levels of sun exposure when a mother is pregnant. • Obesity. • People who are obese or were obese in childhood have an increased risk of multiple sclerosis. • Certain autoimmune diseases. • You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have other autoimmune conditions. • These may include thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease. • Smoking. • People who smoke have a higher risk of relapsing-remitting MS than people who don't smoke. • Gut microbiome. • People with MS may have a different gut microbiome than people who don't have MS. • More research is needed to understand this connection. • Complications of multiple sclerosis may include: Mood changes, such as depression, anxiety or mood swings. • Muscle stiffness or spasms. • Seizures, though they are very rare. • Severe weakness or paralysis, typically in the arms or legs. • Trouble with bladder, bowel or sexual function. • Trouble with thinking and memory.",

      "Overview": "Multiple system atrophy, also called MSA, causes people to lose coordination and balance or become slow and stiff. • It also causes changes in speech and loss of control of other bodily functions. • MSA is a rare condition. • It sometimes shares symptoms with Parkinson's disease, including slow movement, rigid muscles and poor balance. • Treatment includes medicines and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms, but there is no cure. • The condition gets worse over time and eventually leads to death. • In the past, this condition has been called Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy or striatonigral degeneration.",
      "Symptoms": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) symptoms affect many parts of the body. • Symptoms start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. • There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. • The type depends on the symptoms a person has when diagnosed. • This is the most common type of MSA. • Symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease, such as: Stiff muscles. • Trouble bending the arms and legs. • Slow movement, known as bradykinesia. • Tremors at rest or when moving the arms or legs. • Slurred, slow or soft speech, known as dysarthria. • Trouble with posture and balance. • The main symptoms of the cerebellar type involve poor muscle coordination, known as ataxia. • Symptoms may include: Trouble with movement and coordination. • This includes loss of balance and not being able to walk steadily. • Slurred, slow or soft speech, known as dysarthria. • Changes in vision. • This may include blurred or double vision and not being able to focus the eyes. • Trouble chewing or swallowing, known as dysphagia. • For both types of multiple system atrophy, the autonomic nervous system doesn't work properly. • The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in the body, such as blood pressure. • When this system doesn't work properly, it can cause the following symptoms. • Postural hypotension is a form of low blood pressure. • People who have this type of low blood pressure feel dizzy or lightheaded when they stand up after sitting or lying down. • They may even faint. • Not everyone with MSA has postural hypotension. • People with MSA also can develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down. • This is called supine hypertension. • These symptoms include: Constipation. • Loss of bladder or bowel control, known as incontinence. • People with multiple system atrophy may: Produce less sweat. • Have heat intolerance because they sweat less. • Have poor body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet. • Sleep symptoms may include: Agitated sleep due to \"acting out\" dreams. • This is known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. • Breathing that stops and starts during sleep, known as sleep apnea. • A high-pitched whistling sound while breathing, called stridor. • These symptoms may include: Trouble getting or keeping an erection, known as erectile dysfunction. • Trouble with lubrication during sex and having an orgasm. • Loss of interest in sex. • MSA may cause: Color changes in the hands and feet. • People with multiple system atrophy also may experience: Trouble controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying when not expected. • If you develop any of the symptoms of multiple system atrophy, see your healthcare professional. • If you have already been diagnosed with MSA, contact your healthcare professional if your symptoms become worse or if new symptoms occur.",
      "Causes": "There is no known cause for multiple system atrophy (MSA). • Some researchers are studying the possible role of genetics or environmental causes such as a toxin in MSA. • But there's no substantial evidence to support these theories. • MSA causes parts of the brain to shrink. • This is known as atrophy. • The areas of the brain that shrink due to MSA include the cerebellum, basal ganglia and brainstem. • The atrophy of these parts of the brain affect internal body functions and movement. • Under a microscope, the brain tissue of people with MSA shows a buildup of a protein called alpha-synuclein. • Some research suggests that the buildup of this protein leads to multiple system atrophy.",
      "Risk factors": "A risk factor for multiple system atrophy (MSA) is having rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. • People with this disorder act out their dreams. • Most people who have MSA have a history of REM sleep behavior disorder. • Another risk factor is having a condition caused by the autonomic nervous system not working properly. • Symptoms such as urinary incontinence could be an early sign of MSA. • The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions.",
      "Complications": "Complications of multiple system atrophy (MSA) vary from person to person. • But for everyone with the disease, MSA symptoms get worse over time. • The symptoms can make daily activities harder as time goes on. • Possible complications include: Worsening breathing symptoms during sleep. • Injuries from falls caused by poor balance or fainting. • The breakdown of the skin in people who have trouble moving or can't move. • Not being able to care for yourself in day-to-day activities. • Vocal cord paralysis, which affects speech and breathing. • Increased trouble swallowing. • People typically live about 7 to 10 years after multiple system atrophy symptoms first appear. • However, the survival rate with MSA varies widely. • Death is often due to trouble breathing, infections or blood clots in the lungs."

      "Overview": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a group of symptoms linked to swollen, called inflamed, organs or tissues. • People with MIS-C need care in the hospital. • MIS-C was first detected in April 2020. • MIS-C is currently linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Experts are still studying the cause of MIS-C and risk factors for getting it. • Most children who catch the COVID-19 virus have only a mild illness. • But in children with MIS-C, after infection with the COVID-19 virus, the blood vessels, digestive system, skin or eyes become swollen and irritated. • MIS-C is rare. • It most often happens within 2 months after having COVID-19. • The child may have had a known infection. • Or a close contact may have a confirmed infection. • Most children who have MIS-C eventually get better with medical care. • But some kids quickly get worse. • MIS-C can cause life-threatening illness or death. • Rarely, some adults develop symptoms similar to those of MIS-C. • This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). • It also is linked to a current or earlier infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. • People with a prior infection may not have had serious symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of MIS-C are serious and are treated in the hospital. • Not all kids have the same symptoms. • But if no other diagnosis fits, health care professionals may diagnose MIS-C if a child: Either had COVID-19 or has a close contact who had COVID-19 in the 2 months before hospitalization. • Has a fever. • Has a blood test result that shows a high level of inflammation throughout the body, called systemic inflammation. • Has at least two of the following symptoms: Heart problems. • Red, bloodshot eyes. • Redness or swelling of the lips and tongue. • Redness or swelling of the hands or feet. • Pain in the belly, vomiting or diarrhea. • Problems with blood clotting. • Shock. • Get help right away if your child has: Severe stomach pain. • Pain or a feeling of pressure in the chest. • Problems breathing. • Pale gray or blue skin, lips or nail beds. • New confusion. • Inability to wake up or stay awake. • If your child has any of the emergency warning signs listed above, or is severely sick with other symptoms, get care right away. • Take your child to the nearest emergency department or call 911 or your local emergency number. • If your child isn't severely ill but shows other symptoms of MIS-C, contact your child's health care professional right away for advice. • The health care team may want to do tests to check for areas of inflammation and other signs of MIS-C. • These may include blood tests, or imaging tests of the chest, heart or abdomen. • The exact cause of MIS-C is not known yet. • Many children with MIS-C have had a recent infection with the COVID-19 virus. • Some may have a current infection with the virus. • One idea of a possible cause of MIS-C is that infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, either current or earlier, causes the immune system to overreact. • Children diagnosed with MIS-C are often between the ages of 5 and 11 years old. • But cases are reported among children ages 1 to 15. • A few cases have also happened in older kids and in babies. • MIS-C is thought to be a complication of COVID-19. • Without early diagnosis and treatment, MIS-C can lead to severe problems with vital organs, such as the heart. • In rare cases, MIS-C could lead to permanent damage or even death. • In the U.S., COVID-19 vaccines are now offered to people age 6 months and older. • A vaccine can prevent you or your child from getting or spreading the COVID-19 virus. • If you or your child gets COVID-19, a COVID-19 vaccine could prevent you or your child from becoming seriously ill. • To prevent getting the COVID-19 virus and spreading it to others, the CDC recommends following these precautions: Keep hands clean. • Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • If soap and water aren't available, use a hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. • Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick. • Avoid people who are coughing, sneezing or showing other signs that they might be sick and contagious. • In public indoor spaces, keep distance between yourself and others. • This is especially important in places with poor airflow. • When COVID-19 community levels are high, wear a face mask in public indoor places. • If your area has a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital, masks help prevent infection. • The CDC suggests wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable. • Avoid touching your nose, eyes and mouth. • Urge your child to follow your lead and avoid touching the face. • Cover your mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you sneeze or cough. • Throw away the used tissue. • Wash your hands right away. • Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces regularly. • This includes areas of your home such as doorknobs, light switches, remotes and keyboards.",

      "Overview": "A muscle strain is an injury to a muscle or a tendon — the fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones. • Minor injuries may only overstretch a muscle or tendon, while more severe injuries may involve partial or complete tears in these tissues. • Sometimes called pulled muscles, strains commonly occur in the lower back and in the muscles at the back of the thigh (hamstrings). • The difference between a strain and a sprain is that a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone, while a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together. • Initial treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. • Mild strains can be successfully treated at home. • Severe strains sometimes require surgical repair.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include: Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasms Swelling Muscle weakness Mild strains can be treated at home. • See a doctor if your symptoms worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable, or you experience numbness or tingling.",
      "Causes": "Acute strains can be caused by one event, such as using poor body mechanics to lift something heavy. • Chronic muscle strains can result from repetitive injuries when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over.",
      "Risk factors": "Participating in contact sports — such as soccer, football, hockey, boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains. • Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports. • Examples include: Legs and ankles. • Sports that feature quick starts and jumping, such as hurdling and basketball, can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle. • Hands. • Gripping sports, such as gymnastics or golf, can increase your risk of muscle strains in your hands. • Elbows. • Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports.",
      "Prevention": "Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport, fitness or work activity, as part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains. • Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. • If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries."

      "Overview": "Myasthenia gravis (my-us-THEE-nee-uh GRAY-vis) causes muscles under your voluntary control to feel weak and get tired quickly. • This happens when the communication between nerves and muscles breaks down. • There's no cure for myasthenia gravis. • Treatment can help with symptoms. • These symptoms can include weakness of arm or leg muscles, double vision, drooping eyelids, and problems with speaking, chewing, swallowing and breathing. • This disease can affect people of any age, but it's more common in women younger than 40 and in men older than 60.",
      "Symptoms": "Muscle weakness caused by myasthenia gravis gets worse when the affected muscle is used. • Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. • However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. • They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins. • Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control. • Certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others. • In more than half the people who develop myasthenia gravis, their first symptoms affect the eyes. • Symptoms include: Drooping of one or both eyelids, called ptosis. • Double vision, called diplopia, which may be horizontal or vertical, and improves or resolves when one eye is closed. • In about 15% of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles. • These symptoms can: Make speaking difficult. • Your speech might sound soft or nasal, depending on which muscles are affected. • Cause problems with swallowing. • You might choke easily, making it difficult to eat, drink or take pills. • Sometimes, liquids you're trying to swallow come out your nose. • Affect chewing. • The muscles used for chewing might tire halfway through a meal. • This is especially true if you've been eating something hard to chew, such as steak. • Change facial expressions. • For example, your smile might look like a snarl. • Myasthenia gravis also can cause weakness in the neck, arms and legs. • Weakness in the legs can affect how you walk. • Weak neck muscles make it hard to hold up the head. • Talk to your health care provider if you have problems: Breathing. • Seeing. • Swallowing. • Chewing. • Walking. • Using your arms or hands. • Holding up your head. • Your nerves communicate with your muscles by releasing chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that fit into places on the muscle cells, called receptor sites, at the nerve-muscle junction. • In myasthenia gravis, the immune system makes antibodies that block or destroy many of your muscles' receptor sites for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (as-uh-teel-KOH-leen). • With fewer receptor sites available, your muscles receive fewer nerve signals. • This causes weakness. • Antibodies also can block a protein called muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE-roh-seen KIE-nays), sometimes referred to as MuSK. • This protein helps form the nerve-muscle junction. • Antibodies against this protein can lead to myasthenia gravis. • Antibodies against another protein, called lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), can play a part in this condition. • Research studies have found other antibodies and the number of antibodies involved will likely grow over time. • Some people have myasthenia gravis that isn't caused by antibodies blocking acetylcholine, MuSK or LRP4. • This type of myasthenia gravis is called seronegative myasthenia gravis, also known as antibody-negative myasthenia gravis. • In general, researchers believe that this type of myasthenia gravis still comes from a problem with autoimmunity, but the antibodies involved just can't be found yet. • The thymus gland is a part of your immune system. • This gland is located in the upper chest beneath the breastbone. • Researchers believe that the thymus gland makes or helps produce the antibodies that block acetylcholine. • The thymus gland is large in babies and small in healthy adults. • In some adults with myasthenia gravis, however, the thymus gland is larger than usual. • Some people with myasthenia gravis also have tumors of the thymus gland, called thymomas. • Usually, thymomas aren't cancerous, also known as malignant. • But thymomas can become cancerous. • Rarely, mothers with myasthenia gravis have children who are born with myasthenia gravis. • This is called neonatal myasthenia gravis. • If treated immediately, children usually recover within two months after birth. • Some children are born with a rare, hereditary form of myasthenia gravis, called congenital myasthenic syndrome. • Factors that can make myasthenia gravis worse include: Fatigue. • Illness or infection. • Surgery. • Stress. • Some medicines — such as beta blockers, quinidine gluconate, quinidine sulfate, quinine (Qualaquin), phenytoin (Dilantin), certain anesthetics and some antibiotics. • Pregnancy. • Menstrual periods. • Complications of myasthenia gravis are treatable, but some can be life-threatening. • Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition. • It happens when the muscles that control breathing become too weak to work. • Emergency treatment and mechanical assistance with breathing are needed. • Medicines and therapies that filter the blood help people to breathe on their own. • Some people with myasthenia gravis have a tumor in the thymus gland. • The thymus is a gland under the breastbone that is part of the immune system. • Most of these tumors, called thymomas, aren't cancerous. • People with myasthenia gravis are more likely to have the following conditions: Underactive or overactive thyroid. • The thyroid gland in the neck secretes hormones that regulate the metabolism. • If the thyroid is underactive, you might have problems dealing with cold, weight gain and other issues. • An overactive thyroid can cause problems dealing with heat, weight loss and other issues. • Autoimmune conditions. • People with myasthenia gravis might be more likely to have autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.",

      "Overview": "Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease, also known as MOGAD, is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system. • In MOGAD, the immune system attacks the fatty substance that protects nerve fibers in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord. • Symptoms of MOGAD may include vision loss, muscle weakness, stiffness or paralysis, confusion, seizures, and headaches. • These symptoms can be sometimes confused with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis. • There's no cure for MOGAD. • However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, manage symptoms and reduce the likelihood of symptoms returning.",
      "Symptoms": "MOGAD causes painful swelling, known as inflammation. • Symptoms are caused by attacks from: Inflammation of the optic nerve. • Called optic neuritis, this condition may lead to vision loss in one or both eyes and eye pain that gets worse with eye movement. • Optic neuritis in children may be mistaken for a headache. • Inflammation of the spinal cord. • Called transverse myelitis, this condition may lead to arm or leg weakness, muscle stiffness, or paralysis. • It also may cause sensory loss and changes in bowel, bladder or sexual function. • Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. • Called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, also known as ADEM, this condition may lead to vision loss, weakness, unsteady walk and confusion. • ADEM is more common in children with MOGAD. • Other symptoms of MOGAD may include: Seizures. • Headaches. • Fever. • Some people who have MOGAD only experience one attack of symptoms. • This is called monophasic MOGAD and is slightly more common. • However, some people experience multiple attacks, called relapsing MOGAD. • Attacks usually develop over days and can be severe and debilitating. • Disability usually gets worse with each attack. • Attack recovery can take weeks to months. • See a doctor or other healthcare professional if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons.",
      "Causes": "The cause of MOGAD is not known. • It's an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. • In people with MOGAD, the immune system destroys the fatty substance called myelin. • Myelin coats and protects nerve fibers in the optic nerve, brain and spinal cord. • The brain sends messages down nerve fibers that help tell parts of the body what to do. • When the myelin is damaged and nerve fibers are exposed, those messages may be slowed or blocked. • This means those parts of the body won't work properly. • MOGAD is often misdiagnosed as another disease that attacks myelin and causes similar symptoms. • It may be mistaken for multiple sclerosis, known as MS. • Or it may be confused with a condition called neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, also known as NMOSD. • MOGAD is different from MS and NMOSD because the first attack of MOGAD is usually the most severe, but people with the disease can have a complete recovery. • MOGAD also is diagnosed differently, using results from MRI and blood tests. • People with MS and NMOSD typically have multiple attacks, while about half of people with MOGAD have only one attack.",
      "Risk factors": "These factors may increase your risk of developing MOGAD: Age. • Children and young adults are slightly more likely to develop MOGAD. • Recent infection or vaccination. • MOGAD may develop after an infectious illness or vaccination, such as SARS-CoV-2.",
      "Complications": "MOGAD complications are caused by the attacks on the fatty substance that protects nerve fibers in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord. • The first attack is usually the worst, but each attack can cause more damage. • Some possible complications may include: Permanent paralysis in the arms and legs. • Long-term bowel and bladder difficulties. • Blindness in one or both eyes. • Trouble with language, memory and thinking. • Some MOGAD treatments also may cause complications. • Long-term use of certain medicines may result in: Infection. • Lymphoma or skin cancers. • Slowed growth in children. • Headaches. • Kidney failure. • Your healthcare team will work with you to decide which treatment options are the best and how long to continue them."

      "Overview": "Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by blood cells that are poorly formed or don't work properly. • Myelodysplastic syndromes result from something amiss in the spongy material inside your bones where blood cells are made (bone marrow). • Management of myelodysplastic syndromes is most often intended to slow the disease, ease symptoms and prevent complications. • Common measures include blood transfusions and medications to boost blood cell production. • In certain situations, a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be recommended to replace your bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a donor.",
      "Symptoms": "People with myelodysplastic syndromes might not experience signs and symptoms at first. • In time, myelodysplastic syndromes might cause: Fatigue Shortness of breath Unusual paleness (pallor), which occurs due to a low red blood cell count (anemia) Easy or unusual bruising or bleeding, which occurs due to a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) Pinpoint-sized red spots just beneath the skin that are caused by bleeding (petechiae) Frequent infections, which occur due to a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "In a healthy person, bone marrow makes new, immature blood cells that mature over time. • Myelodysplastic syndromes occur when something disrupts this process so that the blood cells don't mature. • Instead of developing normally, the blood cells die in the bone marrow or just after entering the bloodstream. • Over time, there are more immature, defective cells than healthy ones, leading to problems such as fatigue caused by too few healthy red blood cells (anemia), infections caused by too few healthy white blood cells (leukopenia) and bleeding caused by too few blood-clotting platelets (thrombocytopenia). • Most myelodysplastic syndromes have no known cause. • Others are caused by exposure to cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, or to toxic chemicals, such as benzene. • The World Health Organization divides myelodysplastic syndromes into subtypes based on the type of blood cells — red cells, white cells and platelets — involved. • Myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes include: Myelodysplastic syndromes with single-lineage dysplasia. • One blood cell type — white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets — is low in number and appears abnormal under the microscope. • Myelodysplastic syndromes with multilineage dysplasia. • In this subtype, two or three blood cell types are abnormal. • Myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts. • This subtype involves a low number of one or more blood cell types. • A characteristic feature is that existing red blood cells in the bone marrow contain rings of excess iron. • Myelodysplastic syndromes with isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality. • People with this subtype have low numbers of red blood cells, and the cells have a specific mutation in their DNA. • Myelodysplastic syndromes with excess blasts. • In this subtype, any of the three types of blood cells — red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets — might be low and appear abnormal under a microscope. • Very immature blood cells (blasts) are found in the blood and bone marrow. • Myelodysplastic syndromes, unclassifiable. • In this subtype, there are reduced numbers of one or more types of mature blood cells and the cells might look abnormal under the microscope. • Sometimes the blood cells appear normal, but analysis might find that the cells have DNA changes that are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase your risk of myelodysplastic syndromes include: Older age. • Most people with myelodysplastic syndromes are older than 60. • Previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiation. • Chemotherapy or radiation therapy, both of which are commonly used to treat cancer, can increase your risk of myelodysplastic syndromes. • Exposure to certain chemicals. • Chemicals, including benzene, have been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes.",
      "Complications": "Complications of myelodysplastic syndromes include: Anemia. • Reduced numbers of red blood cells can cause anemia, which can make you feel tired. • Recurrent infections. • Having too few white blood cells increases your risk of serious infections. • Bleeding that won't stop. • Lacking platelets in your blood to stop bleeding can lead to excessive bleeding. • Increased risk of cancer. • Some people with myelodysplastic syndromes might eventually develop a cancer of the bone marrow and blood cells (leukemia)."

      "Overview": "Myelofibrosis is an uncommon type of bone marrow cancer that disrupts your body's normal production of blood cells. • Myelofibrosis causes extensive scarring in your bone marrow, leading to severe anemia that can cause weakness and fatigue. • Bone marrow scarring can also cause you to have a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets, which increases the risk of bleeding. • Myelofibrosis often causes an enlarged spleen. • Myelofibrosis is considered to be a chronic leukemia — a cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body. • Myelofibrosis belongs to a group of diseases called myeloproliferative disorders. • Myelofibrosis can happen on its own (primary myelofibrosis) or it can develop from another bone marrow disorder (secondary myelofibrosis). • Some people with myelofibrosis have no symptoms and might not need treatment right away. • Others with more-serious forms of the disease might need aggressive treatments right away. • Treatment for myelofibrosis, which focuses on relieving symptoms, can involve a variety of options.",
      "Symptoms": "Myelofibrosis usually develops slowly. • In its very early stages, many people don't experience signs or symptoms. • As disruption of normal blood cell production increases, signs and symptoms may include: Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen Easy bruising Easy bleeding Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats) Fever Bone pain Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Myelofibrosis occurs when bone marrow stem cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. • The stem cells have the ability to replicate and divide into the multiple specialized cells that make up your blood — red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. • It's not clear what causes the genetic mutations in bone marrow stem cells. • As the mutated blood stem cells replicate and divide, they pass along the mutations to the new cells. • As more and more of these mutated cells are created, they begin to have serious effects on blood production. • The end result is usually a lack of red blood cells — which causes the anemia characteristic of myelofibrosis — and an overabundance of white blood cells and varying levels of platelets. • In people with myelofibrosis, the normally spongy bone marrow becomes scarred. • Several specific gene mutations have been identified in people with myelofibrosis. • The most common is the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene mutation. • Other less common mutations include CALR and MPL. • Some people with myelofibrosis don't have any identifiable gene mutations. • Knowing whether these gene mutations are associated with your myelofibrosis helps determine your prognosis and your treatment.",
      "Risk factors": "Although the cause of myelofibrosis often isn't known, certain factors are known to increase your risk: Age. • Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50. • Another blood cell disorder. • A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. • Exposure to certain chemicals. • Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene. • Exposure to radiation. • People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.",
      "Complications": "Complications that may result from myelofibrosis include: Increased pressure on blood flowing into your liver. • Normally, blood flow from the spleen enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. • Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can lead to high blood pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). • This in turn can force excess blood into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, potentially causing these veins to rupture and bleed. • Pain. • A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain. • Growths in other areas of your body. • Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis) may create clumps (tumors) of developing blood cells in other areas of your body. • These tumors may cause problems such as bleeding in your gastrointestinal system, coughing or spitting up of blood, compression of your spinal cord, or seizures. • Bleeding complications. • As the disease progresses, your platelet count tends to drop below normal (thrombocytopenia) and platelet function becomes impaired. • An insufficient number of platelets can lead to easy bleeding — an issue that you and your doctor will want to discuss if you're contemplating any type of surgical procedure. • Acute leukemia. • Some people with myelofibrosis eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly."

      "Symptoms": "Some people with early myocarditis don't have symptoms. • Others have mild symptoms. • Common myocarditis symptoms include: Chest pain. • Fatigue. • Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet. • Rapid or irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Shortness of breath, at rest or during activity. • Lightheadedness or feeling like you might faint. • Flu-like symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, fever or sore throat. • Sometimes, myocarditis symptoms are like symptoms of a heart attack. • If you are having unexplained chest pain and shortness of breath, seek emergency medical help. • When children get myocarditis, symptoms may include: Difficulty breathing. • Rapid breathing. • Chest pain. • Rapid or irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Fainting. • Fever. • Contact a healthcare professional if you have symptoms of myocarditis. • Symptoms of myocarditis can seem like a heart attack. • Get emergency medical help if you have unexplained chest pain, rapid heartbeats or shortness of breath. • If you have severe symptoms, go to the emergency room or call for emergency medical help. • Infections can cause myocarditis. • Viruses. • Many viruses have been linked to myocarditis, including the adenovirus, which causes the common cold; the COVID-19 virus; viruses that cause hepatitis B and C; parvovirus, which causes a mild rash, usually in children; and herpes simplex virus. • Gastrointestinal infections due to echoviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, and German measles, also called rubella, all can cause myocarditis. • Myocarditis also can be caused by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. • Bacteria. • Bacteria that can cause myocarditis include staphylococcus, streptococcus, and bacteria that cause diphtheria and Lyme disease. • Parasites. • Parasites that can cause myocarditis are Trypanosoma cruzi and toxoplasma. • Some parasites are transmitted by insects and can cause a condition called Chagas disease. • Chagas disease is much more common in Central and South America than in the United States. • Fungi. • A fungal infection may cause myocarditis, particularly in people with weakened immune systems. • Fungal infections linked to myocarditis include yeast infections, such as candida; molds, such as aspergillus; and histoplasma, often found in bird droppings. • Myocarditis also may be caused by: Certain medicines or illegal drugs. • These include medicines used to treat cancer; antibiotics, such as penicillin and sulfonamide drugs; some anti-seizure medicines; and cocaine. • When these cause myocarditis, it's called drug-induced myocarditis. • Chemicals or radiation. • Exposure to carbon monoxide and radiation can sometimes cause myocarditis. • Other health conditions. • Conditions that may cause myocarditis include lupus, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. • Often, the cause of myocarditis isn't found. • Usually, myocarditis goes away without complications. • However, severe myocarditis can permanently damage the heart muscle. • Possible complications of myocarditis may include: Heart failure. • Untreated, myocarditis can damage the heart muscle so that it can't pump blood well. • People with myocarditis-related heart failure may need a ventricular assist device or a heart transplant. • Heart attack or stroke. • If the heart muscle is damaged and can't pump blood, the blood that collects in the heart can form clots. • A heart attack can occur if a clot blocks one of the heart arteries. • A stroke can happen if a blood clot in the heart travels to an artery leading to the brain. • Rapid or irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Damage to the heart muscle can change how the heart beats. • Certain arrhythmias increase the risk of stroke. • Sudden cardiac death. • Certain serious irregular heartbeats can cause the heart to suddenly stop beating, a condition called sudden cardiac arrest. • If it leads to death it's called sudden cardiac death. • There's no specific prevention for myocarditis. • However, taking these steps to prevent infections might help: Stay away from people who are sick. • Stay away from people with symptoms of the flu or other respiratory illness until they are better. • If you're sick with symptoms of a viral infection, try to avoid passing the germs to others. • Wash your hands regularly. • Frequent hand-washing is one of the best ways to not get sick and spread germs. • Avoid risky behaviors. • To reduce the chances of getting an HIV-related myocardial infection, practice safe sex and don't use illegal drugs. • Get recommended vaccines. • Stay up to date on recommended vaccines, including those that protect against COVID-19, influenza and rubella — diseases that can cause myocarditis. • Rarely, the COVID-19 vaccine can cause myocarditis and inflammation of the outer heart lining, called pericarditis, particularly in males ages 12 to 29. • Talk with your healthcare team about the benefits and risks of vaccines.",

      "Causes": "Myoclonus may be caused by a variety of underlying problems. • It is commonly separated into different types based on what is causing it. • The cause can help determine treatment. • This type of myoclonus occurs in healthy people and rarely needs treatment. • Examples include: Hiccups. • Sleep starts. • Shakes or spasms due to anxiety or exercise. • Infant muscle twitching during sleep or after a feeding. • Essential myoclonus occurs on its own, usually without other symptoms and without being related to any underlying illness. • The cause of essential myoclonus is often unknown. • In some cases, the cause is hereditary, meaning passed down in families. • This type of myoclonus occurs as part of an epileptic disorder. • Symptomatic myoclonus results from an underlying medical condition. • It is sometimes called secondary myoclonus. • Examples include: Head or spinal cord injury. • Infection. • Kidney or liver failure. • Lipid storage disease. • Chemical or drug poisoning. • Prolonged oxygen deprivation. • Medicine reaction. • Autoimmune inflammatory conditions. • Metabolic disorders. • Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Nervous system conditions that result in secondary myoclonus include: Stroke. • Brain tumor. • Huntington's disease. • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. • Alzheimer's disease. • Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. • Corticobasal degeneration. • Frontotemporal dementia. • Multiple system atrophy."

      "Overview": "Myofascial pain syndrome is a long-term pain condition. • It involves some muscles and the thin cover of tissue that holds muscles in place, called fascia. • Pressure on these areas, called trigger points, causes pain. • Sometimes, the pain is felt in other parts of the body. • This is called referred pain. • The pain often is felt as shoulder pain, back pain, tension headaches and face pain. • This syndrome can happen after a muscle has been tensed over and over. • Repeated motions used in jobs or hobbies can be the cause. • So can stress-related muscle tension, poor posture and weak muscles. • In some cases, the cause of myofascial pain is unknown. • Almost everyone has felt muscle tension pain. • But the pain of myofascial pain syndrome doesn't go away. • Treatment options include exercise, massage, physical therapy and shots in the trigger points. • Pain medicines and finding ways to relax also can help.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may include: Deep, aching pain in a muscle. • Pain that doesn't go away or gets worse. • A tender knot in a muscle. • Trouble sleeping due to pain. • A general feeling of being not well, called malaise. • Tiredness. • Most people have muscle pain at times. • But if your muscle pain doesn't go away with rest, massage and other self-care measures, make an appointment with your healthcare professional.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of myofascial pain syndrome is not known. • Areas of tight muscle fibers, called trigger points, form in muscles. • Too much use of the muscles, most often with poor form, injury to the muscle and mental stress likely help cause trigger points.",
      "Risk factors": "In myofascial pain syndrome, something such as muscle tightness sets off trigger points in the muscles. • Factors that may increase the risk of muscle trigger points include: Muscle injury. • A muscle injury or ongoing muscle stress may lead to the forming of trigger points. • For instance, a spot in or near a strained muscle may become a trigger point. • Repeat motions and poor posture also can increase the risk. • Stress and anxiety. • People who often feel stressed and anxious may be more likely to get trigger points in their muscles. • One theory is that these people may be more likely to clench their muscles. • Clenching is a form of repeated strain that leaves muscles open to trigger points.",
      "Complications": "Complications linked to myofascial pain syndrome include: Sleep problems. • Symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome may make it hard to sleep. • It might be hard to find a good sleep position. • And if you move while sleeping, you might hit a trigger point and awaken. • Fibromyalgia. • Some research suggests that myofascial pain syndrome may lead to fibromyalgia in some people. • Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition of widespread pain. • It's believed that the brains of people with fibromyalgia respond more to pain signals over time. • Some experts believe myofascial pain syndrome might help start this process."

      "Overview": "Myxofibrosarcoma is a type of cancer that begins in the connective tissue. • It tends to happen in the arms and legs. • Myxofibrosarcoma starts as a growth of cells that can grow into healthy body tissue. • Myxofibrosarcoma might cause a lump under the skin that grows slowly. • It often isn't painful. • This cancer happens most often in older adults. • Myxofibrosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. • Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that happen in the soft tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of myxofibrosarcoma include: A painless lump on an arm or leg. • A lump that grows slowly. • Myxofibrosarcoma most often starts in the leg. • It rarely starts in the abdomen, where other kinds of sarcomas tend to grow. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "The cause of myxofibrosarcoma often isn't known. • This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the connective tissue. • Myxofibrosarcoma happens when cells develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells can form a lump that may grow into healthy body tissue.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of myxofibrosarcoma is higher in adults. • This cancer happens most often in adults ages 50 to 70. • It is rare in people under age 30. • There is no way to prevent myxofibrosarcoma."
