      "Overview": "Painful intercourse can happen for reasons that range from structural problems to psychological concerns. • Many people have painful intercourse at some point in their lives. • The medical term for painful intercourse is dyspareunia (dis-puh-ROO-nee-uh). • It is lasting or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after sex. • Talk with your healthcare professional if you're having painful intercourse. • Treatments focus on the cause and can help stop or ease this common problem.",
      "Symptoms": "If you have painful intercourse, you might feel: Pain only at sexual entry, called penetration. • Pain with every penetration, including putting in a tampon. • Deep pain during thrusting. • Burning pain or aching pain. • Throbbing pain lasting hours after sex. • If you have recurrent pain during sex, talk with your healthcare professional. • Treating the problem can help your sex life, your emotional intimacy and your self-image. • Physical causes of painful intercourse differ, depending on whether the pain happens at entry or with deep thrusting. • Emotional factors can be linked to many types of painful intercourse. • Pain during penetration might be associated with a range of factors, including: Not enough lubrication. • This is often the result of not enough foreplay. • A drop in estrogen levels after menopause or childbirth or during breastfeeding also can be a cause. • Certain medicines can affect sexual desire or arousal. • That can decrease lubrication and make sex painful. • Those medicines include antidepressants, high blood pressure medicines, sedatives, antihistamines and certain birth control pills. • Injury, trauma or irritation. • This includes injury or irritation from an accident, pelvic surgery, female circumcision or a cut made during childbirth to enlarge the birth canal, called episiotomy. • Inflammation, infection or skin disorders. • An infection in the genital area or urinary tract can cause painful intercourse. • Eczema or other skin problems in the genital area also can be the cause. • Vaginismus. • These involuntary spasms of the muscles of the vaginal wall can make penetration painful. • A problem present at birth. • Not having a fully formed vagina, called vaginal agenesis, or having a membrane that blocks the vaginal opening, called imperforate hymen, could cause painful intercourse. • Deep pain usually occurs with deep penetration. • It might be worse in certain positions. • Causes include: Certain illnesses and conditions. • The list includes endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine prolapse, retroverted uterus, uterine fibroids, cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic floor conditions, adenomyosis, hemorrhoids and ovarian cysts. • Surgeries or medical treatments. • Scarring from pelvic surgery, including hysterectomy, can cause painful intercourse. • Medical treatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy, can cause changes that make sex painful. • Emotions are deeply intertwined with sexual activity, so they might play a role in sexual pain. • Emotional factors include: Psychological issues. • Anxiety, depression, concerns about physical appearance, fear of intimacy or relationship problems can contribute to a low level of arousal and resulting discomfort or pain. • Stress. • Your pelvic floor muscles tend to tighten in response to stress in your life. • This can contribute to pain during intercourse. • History of sexual abuse. • Not everyone with dyspareunia has a history of sexual abuse. • But if you have been abused, it can play a role. • It can be hard to tell whether emotional factors are associated with dyspareunia. • Initial pain can lead to fear of recurring pain, making it difficult to relax, which can lead to more pain. • You might start avoiding sex if you associate it with the pain. • Many factors can raise the risk of painful intercourse. • They include illnesses, surgeries and other medical treatments, and mental health issues.",

      "Overview": "Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that begins as a growth of cells in the pancreas. • The pancreas lies behind the lower part of the stomach. • It makes enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar. • The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. • This type begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas. • Pancreatic cancer rarely is found at its early stages when the chance of curing it is greatest. • This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs. • Your health care team considers the extent of your pancreatic cancer when creating your treatment plan. • Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a mix of these.",
      "Symptoms": "Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause symptoms until the disease is advanced. • When they happen, signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include: Belly pain that spreads to the sides or back. • Loss of appetite. • Weight loss. • Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. • Light-colored or floating stools. • Dark-colored urine. • Itching. • New diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes that's getting harder to control. • Pain and swelling in an arm or leg, which might be caused by a blood clot. • Tiredness or weakness. • Make an appointment with a health care professional if you have symptoms that worry you. • It's not clear what causes pancreatic cancer. • Doctors have found some factors that might raise the risk of this type of cancer. • These include smoking and having a family history of pancreatic cancer. • The pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side. • It releases hormones, including insulin. • These hormones help the body process the sugar in the foods you eat. • The pancreas also makes digestive juices to help the body digest food and take in nutrients. • Pancreatic cancer happens when cells in the pancreas develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the instructions tell the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The cells die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes there to be too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas. • This type of cancer is called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer. • Less often, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. • These types of cancer are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic endocrine cancer. • Factors that might raise the risk of pancreatic cancer include: Smoking. • Type 2 diabetes. • Chronic inflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis. • Family history of DNA changes that can increase cancer risk. • These include changes in the BRCA2 gene, Lynch syndrome and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome. • Family history of pancreatic cancer. • Obesity. • Older age. • Most people with pancreatic cancer are over 65. • Drinking a lot of alcohol. • As pancreatic cancer progresses, it can cause complications such as: Weight loss. • People with pancreatic cancer might lose weight as the cancer uses more of the body's energy. • Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatments or a cancer pressing on the stomach might make it hard to eat. • Sometimes the body has trouble getting nutrients from food because the pancreas isn't making enough digestive juices. • Jaundice. • Pancreatic cancer that blocks the liver's bile duct can cause jaundice. • Signs include yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. • Jaundice can cause dark-colored urine and pale-colored stools. • Jaundice often occurs without belly pain. • If the bile duct is blocked, a plastic or metal tube called a stent can be put inside it. • The stent helps hold the bile duct open. • This is done using a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, also called ERCP. • During ERCP, a health care professional puts a long tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope, down the throat. • The tube goes through the stomach and into the upper part of the small intestine. • The health professional puts a dye into the pancreatic ducts and bile ducts through a small tube that fits through the endoscope. • The dye helps the ducts show up on imaging tests. • The health professional uses those images to place a stent at the right spot in the duct to help hold it open. • Pain. • A growing tumor may press on nerves in your abdomen, causing pain that can become severe. • Pain medications can help you feel more comfortable. • Treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, might help slow tumor growth and provide some pain relief. • When medicines aren't helping, a health care professional might suggest a celiac plexus block. • This procedure uses a needle to put alcohol into the nerves that control pain in the belly. • The alcohol stops the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain. • Bowel blockage. • Pancreatic cancer can grow into or press on the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. • This can block the flow of digested food from the stomach into the intestines. • A health care professional might suggest putting a tube called a stent in the small intestine to hold it open. • Sometimes, it might help to have surgery to place a feeding tube. • Or surgery can attach the stomach to a lower part of the intestines where the cancer isn't causing a blockage. • Screening uses tests to look for signs of pancreatic cancer in people who don't have symptoms. • It might be an option if you have a very high risk of pancreatic cancer. • Your risk might be high if you have a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or if you have an inherited DNA change that increases the risk of cancer. • Pancreatic cancer screening might involve imaging tests, such as MRI and ultrasound. • These tests are generally repeated every year. • The goal of screening is to find pancreatic cancer when it's small and most likely to be cured. • Research is ongoing, so it's not yet clear whether screening can lower the risk of dying of pancreatic cancer. • There are risks to screening. • This includes the chance of finding something that requires surgery but later turns out to not be cancer. • Talk about the benefits and risks of pancreatic cancer screening with your health care team. • Together you can decide whether screening is right for you. • If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, discuss it with a health care professional. • The health professional can review your family history and help you understand whether genetic testing might be right for you. • Genetic testing can find DNA changes that run in families and increase the risk of cancer. • If you're interested in genetic testing, you might be referred to a genetic counselor or other health care professional trained in genetics. • You might reduce your risk of pancreatic cancer if you: Stop smoking. • If you smoke, talk to a member of your health care team about ways to help you stop. • These might include support groups, medicines and nicotine replacement therapy. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain it. • If you need to lose weight, aim for a slow, steady weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week. • To help you lose weight, exercise most days of the week. • Slowly increase the amount of exercise you get. • Choose a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains with smaller portions.",

      "Overview": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. • Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work. • The pancreas is a long, flat gland that's tucked behind the stomach. • The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars. • Pancreatitis can be an acute condition. • This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time. • Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. • The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time. • Acute pancreatitis may improve on its own. • More-serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life-threatening complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of pancreatitis may vary. • Acute pancreatitis symptoms may include: Pain in the upper belly. • Pain in the upper belly that radiates to the back. • Tenderness when touching the belly. • Fever. • Rapid pulse. • Upset stomach. • Vomiting. • Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms include: Pain in the upper belly. • Belly pain that feels worse after eating. • Losing weight without trying. • Oily, smelly stools. • Some people with chronic pancreatitis only develop symptoms after they get complications of the disease. • Make an appointment with your doctor if you have sudden belly pain or belly pain that doesn't improve. • Seek immediate medical help if your pain is so severe that you can't sit still or find a position that makes you more comfortable. • The pancreas has two major roles. • It produces insulin, which helps the body manage and use sugars. • The pancreas also produces dietary juices, called enzymes, that help with digestion. • The pancreas makes and stores \"turned off\" versions of the enzymes. • After the pancreas sends the enzymes into the small intestine, they are \"turned on\" and break down proteins in the small intestine. • If the enzymes are turned on too soon, they can start acting like digestive juices inside the pancreas. • The action can irritate, damage or destroy cells. • This problem, in turn, leads to immune system responses that cause swelling and other events that affect how the pancreas works. • Several conditions can lead to acute pancreatitis, including: Blockage in the bile duct caused by gallstones. • Heavy alcohol use. • Certain medicines. • High triglyceride levels in the blood. • High calcium levels in the blood. • Pancreas cancer. • Injuries from trauma or surgery. • Conditions that can lead to chronic pancreatitis include: Damage from repeated acute pancreatitis. • Heavy alcohol use. • Inherited genes linked to pancreatitis. • High triglyceride levels in the blood. • High calcium levels in the blood. • Sometimes, a cause for pancreatitis is never found. • This is known as idiopathic pancreatitis. • Factors that increase your risk of pancreatitis include: Excessive alcohol use. • Research shows that having four or five drinks a day increases the risk of pancreatitis. • Cigarette smoking. • Compared with nonsmokers, smokers are on average three times more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis. • Quitting smoking can decrease the risk. • Obesity. • People with a body mass index of 30 or higher are at increased risk of pancreatitis. • Diabetes. • Having diabetes increases the risk of pancreatitis. • Family history of pancreatitis. • A number of genes have been linked to chronic pancreatitis. • A family history of the disease is linked to an increased risk, especially when combined with other risk factors. • Pancreatitis can cause serious complications, including: Kidney failure. • Acute pancreatitis may result in the kidneys not filtering waste from the blood. • Artificial filtering, called dialysis, may be needed for short-term or long-term treatment. • Breathing problems. • Acute pancreatitis can cause changes in how the lungs work, causing the level of oxygen in the blood to fall to dangerously low levels. • Infection. • Acute pancreatitis can make the pancreas vulnerable to infections. • Pancreatic infections are serious and require intensive treatment, such as surgery or other procedures to remove the infected tissue. • Pseudocyst. • Acute and chronic pancreatitis can cause fluid and debris to collect in a \"pocket\" in the pancreas, called a pseudocyst. • A large pseudocyst that ruptures can cause complications such as internal bleeding and infection. • Malnutrition. • With both acute and chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas may not produce enough enzymes for the digestive system. • This can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea and weight loss. • Diabetes. • Diabetes can develop when chronic pancreatitis damages cells that produce insulin. • Pancreatic cancer. • Long-standing inflammation in the pancreas is a risk factor for cancer of the pancreas.",

      "Symptoms": "Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. • They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. • You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently. • Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. • You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides. • Panic attacks typically include some of these signs or symptoms: Sense of impending doom or danger Fear of loss of control or death Rapid, pounding heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Shortness of breath or tightness in your throat Chills Hot flashes Nausea Abdominal cramping Chest pain Headache Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness Numbness or tingling sensation Feeling of unreality or detachment One of the worst things about panic attacks is the intense fear that you'll have another one. • You may fear having panic attacks so much that you avoid certain situations where they may occur. • If you have panic attack symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. • Panic attacks, while intensely uncomfortable, are not dangerous. • But panic attacks are hard to manage on your own, and they may get worse without treatment. • Panic attack symptoms can also resemble symptoms of other serious health problems, such as a heart attack, so it's important to get evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms. • It's not known what causes panic attacks or panic disorder, but these factors may play a role: Genetics Major stress Temperament that is more sensitive to stress or prone to negative emotions Certain changes in the way parts of your brain function Panic attacks may come on suddenly and without warning at first, but over time, they're usually triggered by certain situations. • Some research suggests that your body's natural fight-or-flight response to danger is involved in panic attacks. • For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively. • Your heart rate and breathing would speed up as your body prepared for a life-threatening situation. • Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack. • But it's unknown why a panic attack occurs when there's no obvious danger present. • Symptoms of panic disorder often start in the late teens or early adulthood and affect more women than men. • Factors that may increase the risk of developing panic attacks or panic disorder include: Family history of panic attacks or panic disorder Major life stress, such as the death or serious illness of a loved one A traumatic event, such as sexual assault or a serious accident Major changes in your life, such as a divorce or the addition of a baby Smoking or excessive caffeine intake History of childhood physical or sexual abuse Left untreated, panic attacks and panic disorder can affect almost every area of your life. • You may be so afraid of having more panic attacks that you live in a constant state of fear, ruining your quality of life. • Complications that panic attacks may cause or be linked to include: Development of specific phobias, such as fear of driving or leaving your home Frequent medical care for health concerns and other medical conditions Avoidance of social situations Problems at work or school Depression, anxiety disorders and other psychiatric disorders Increased risk of suicide or suicidal thoughts Alcohol or other substance misuse Financial problems For some people, panic disorder may include agoraphobia — avoiding places or situations that cause you anxiety because you fear being unable to escape or get help if you have a panic attack. • Or you may become reliant on others to be with you in order to leave your home. • There's no sure way to prevent panic attacks or panic disorder. • However, these recommendations may help. • Get treatment for panic attacks as soon as possible to help stop them from getting worse or becoming more frequent. • Stick with your treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of panic attack symptoms. • Get regular physical activity, which may play a role in protecting against anxiety.",

      "Overview": "A paraganglioma is a growth of cells that can happen in different places in the body. • The growth, called a tumor, forms from an important type of nerve cell that's found throughout the body. • Paragangliomas most often start in the head, neck, stomach area or pelvis. • A paraganglioma is rare. • And most often, it's not cancer. • When a tumor isn't cancer, it's called benign. • Sometimes a paraganglioma is cancerous. • A cancerous tumor can spread to other parts of the body. • Paragangliomas often don't have a clear cause. • Some paragangliomas are caused by DNA changes that pass from parents to children. • Paragangliomas can form at any age. • Healthcare professionals most often find them in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. • Paraganglioma treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. • If the paraganglioma is cancerous and spreads to other areas of the body, more treatments may be needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Paraganglioma symptoms may depend on where the tumor starts. • Paragangliomas most often start in the head, neck, stomach area or pelvis. • Symptoms of a paraganglioma in the head or neck can include: A rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound in the ears, called pulsatile tinnitus. • Trouble swallowing. • Hoarse voice. • Hearing loss. • Blurred vision. • Dizziness. • Symptoms of a paraganglioma in the head and neck area might happen as the tumor grows larger. • The tumor can press on nearby structures. • When paragangliomas form in other places in the body, the symptoms are more likely to be caused by hormones that the paraganglioma makes. • The hormones, called catecholamines, play a role in how the body response to stress. • They include adrenaline, also known as the fight-or-flight hormone. • Symptoms of paragangliomas that make hormones include: High blood pressure. • Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. • The sudden loss of color in the face. • Sweating. • Headache. • Uncontrolled shaking in the hands or arms. • General weakness. • These symptoms may come and go. • Some people with paragangliomas don't have any symptoms. • They may learn they have these tumors when imaging tests done for other reasons happen to spot the tumors. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you're concerned you may have paraganglioma symptoms. • This is important if you have multiple paraganglioma symptoms at the same time. • Talk with your healthcare professional about your risk of paraganglioma if you have high blood pressure that's hard to control. • This includes high blood pressure that needs treatment with more than one medicine. • Also talk with your healthcare professional if your blood pressure spikes from time to time when you or a healthcare professional measures it.",
      "Causes": "Paragangliomas often don't have a clear cause. • Sometimes these tumors run in families. • They can be caused by DNA changes that are passed from parents to children. • But many people with paragangliomas don't have a family history of these tumors and the cause is not known. • A paraganglioma is a growth of cells. • It forms from a type of nerve cell called a chromaffin cell. • Chromaffin cells perform key roles in the body, including controlling blood pressure. • A paraganglioma starts when chromaffin cells develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time. • In paraganglioma cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the paraganglioma cells to make many more cells quickly. • The cells keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes a growth of cells called a tumor. • Most paragangliomas stay where they started. • They don't spread to other parts of the body. • But sometimes cells can break away from a paraganglioma and spread. • When this happens, it's called metastatic paraganglioma. • When a paraganglioma spreads, it most often spreads to nearby lymph nodes. • It also can spread to the lungs, liver and bones. • A paraganglioma is closely related to another rare tumor called a pheochromocytoma. • A pheochromocytoma is a tumor that starts in chromaffin cells in the adrenal glands. • The adrenal glands are two glands that sit on top of the kidneys.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of paraganglioma is higher in people who have a family history of this tumor. • Some paragangliomas are caused by DNA changes that pass from parents to children. • Having a family history of paraganglioma might be a sign that certain DNA changes run in your family. • Some other health conditions caused by DNA changes that pass from parents to children raise the risk of paragangliomas. • These conditions include: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2. • Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2, also called MEN 2, can cause tumors in one or more of the glands that make hormones, including the thyroid and the parathyroid glands. • There are two types of MEN 2 — type 2A and type 2B. • Both raise the risk of paragangliomas. • Von Hippel-Lindau disease. • Von Hippel-Lindau disease can cause tumors and cysts to form in many parts of the body. • Possible sites include the brain, spinal cord and kidneys. • Neurofibromatosis 1. • Neurofibromatosis 1 causes tumors called neurofibromas to form in the skin. • The condition also can cause tumors of the optic nerve. • The optic nerve is the nerve at the back of the eye that connects to the brain. • Hereditary paraganglioma syndromes. • Hereditary paraganglioma syndromes can cause pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. • People with these syndromes often have more than one paraganglioma. • Carney-Stratakis dyad. • Carney-Stratakis dyad causes tumors of the digestive tract and paragangliomas."

      "Overview": "Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are a group of rare conditions that develop in some people who have cancer. • In addition to the nervous system, paraneoplastic syndromes also can affect other organ systems including hormones, skin, blood and joints. • Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system occur when cancer-fighting agents of the immune system also attack parts of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscle. • Depending on where the nervous system is affected, paraneoplastic syndromes can affect muscle movement, coordination, sensory perception, memory, thinking skills or even sleep. • Sometimes the injury to the nervous system can be reversed with therapy directed toward the cancer and the immune system. • But sometimes paraneoplastic syndromes can result in permanent damage to the nervous system. • Treating the cancer and other therapies may prevent further damage and improve symptoms and quality of life.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. • They often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. • Symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include: Trouble walking. • Trouble with balance. • Loss of muscle coordination. • Loss of muscle tone or weakness. • Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects. • Trouble swallowing. • Slurred speech or stuttering. • Memory loss and other thinking impairment. • Vision changes. • Trouble sleeping. • Seizures. • Hallucinations. • Movements that can't be controlled. • Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include: Cerebellar degeneration, also known as cerebellar ataxia. • In this syndrome, loss of nerve cells occurs in the area of the brain called the cerebellum that controls muscle functions and balance. • Symptoms may include trouble walking, lack of coordination in the arms and legs, trouble maintaining posture, and dizziness. • They also may include nausea, eye movements that can't be controlled, double vision, trouble speaking or trouble swallowing. • Limbic encephalitis. • This syndrome involves swelling, known as inflammation, of an area of the brain known as the limbic system. • The limbic system controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. • People with this condition may experience personality changes or mood changes, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. • Encephalomyelitis. • This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. • There may be a wide variety of symptoms depending on the area affected. • Opsoclonus-myoclonus. • This syndrome occurs when the cerebellum or its connections don't work properly. • It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements and muscle jerks in the arms, legs and trunk. • Stiff person syndrome. • Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome leads to serious muscle stiffness, known as rigidity, that gets worse over time. • Stiffness mainly affects the spine and legs. • It also may cause painful muscle spasms. • Myelopathy. • This term refers to a syndrome that involves injury to the spinal cord. • Symptoms depend on the level of spinal cord injury. • Symptoms may include changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness and numbness up to a certain level in the body. • If the level of injury includes the neck, it can cause a serious disability that affects the arms and legs. • Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. • This syndrome is caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. • Symptoms include muscle weakness in the pelvis and legs, and fatigue. • It also may cause trouble swallowing and speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. • Other symptoms may include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction. • When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. • Myasthenia gravis. • Myasthenia gravis also is related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. • People with myasthenia gravis have weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control. • These include muscles in the face, eyes, arms and legs. • The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. • When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland, known as thymoma. • Neuromyotonia, also known as Isaacs' syndrome. • Neuromyotonia occurs when there are an excess number of nerve impulses that control muscle movement. • This is known as peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. • These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a \"bag of worms\" and stiffness that gets worse over time. • It also may cause muscle cramps, slowed movement and other issues with the muscles. • Peripheral neuropathy. • In this condition, nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of the body are damaged. • These nerves are known as peripheral nerves. • When damage involves only the sensory nerves, it causes pain and changes in sensation anywhere in the body. • Dysautonomia. • Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of symptoms that result from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions. • Known as the autonomic nervous system, these nerves control heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. • Symptoms may include low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing. • Symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are similar to those of many conditions, including cancer, cancer complications and some cancer treatments. • But if you have any symptoms suggesting a paraneoplastic syndrome, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible. • Early diagnosis and appropriate care are important for treating the cancer and preventing further damage of the nervous system.",
      "Causes": "Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are not caused by cancer cells directly or by the cancer spreading, known as metastasis. • They're also not caused by other complications, such as infections or treatment side effects. • Instead, the syndromes occur alongside the cancer as a result of the activation of your immune system. • Researchers believe that paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system are caused by cancer-fighting abilities of the immune system. • In particular, antibodies and certain white blood cells, known as T cells, are thought to be involved. • Instead of attacking only the cancer cells, these immune system agents also attack the healthy cells of the nervous system.",
      "Risk factors": "Any cancer may be associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome of the nervous system. • However, it occurs more often in people with cancers of the lung, ovary, breast, testis or lymphatic system."

      "Overview": "Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder of the nervous system that worsens over time. • The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement. • Symptoms start slowly. • The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand or sometimes a foot or the jaw. • Tremor is common in Parkinson's disease. • But the disorder also may cause stiffness, slowing of movement and trouble with balance that raises the risk of falls. • In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. • Your arms may not swing when you walk. • Your speech may become soft or slurred. • Symptoms get worse over time. • Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines may help symptoms get better. • Sometimes a healthcare professional may suggest surgery to help control parts of the brain. • This surgery may help lessen symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. • Early symptoms may be mild, and you may not even notice them. • Symptoms often begin on one side of the body, then affect both sides. • Symptoms are usually worse on one side than the other. • Some Parkinson's disease symptoms are similar to those of other disorders. • Parkinson's symptoms may include: Tremor. • This rhythmic shaking usually begins in the hands or fingers. • Sometimes tremor begins in the foot or jaw. • You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. • This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. • Your hand may tremble when it's at rest or when you're under stress. • You may notice that you shake less when you're doing some sort of task or moving around. • Slowed movement, also called bradykinesia. • Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks more difficult. • It may be hard to get out of a chair, shower or get dressed. • You may have less expression in your face. • It may be hard to blink. • Rigid muscles. • You may have stiff muscles in any part of your body. • Your muscles may feel tense and painful, and your arm movements may be short and jerky. • Poor posture and balance. • Your posture may become stooped. • You may fall or have balance problems. • Loss of automatic movements. • You may be less able to make certain movements that you typically do without thinking, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk. • Speech changes. • You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. • Your speech may be flat or monotone, without typical speech patterns. • Writing changes. • You may have trouble writing, and your writing may appear cramped and small. • Nonmotor symptoms. • These may include depression, anxiety, constipation and sleep problems. • They also may include acting out dreams, needing to urinate often, trouble smelling, problems with thinking and memory, and feeling very tired. • See a healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of Parkinson's disease. • This will help diagnose your condition and rule out other causes. • In Parkinson's disease, nerve cells in the brain called neurons slowly break down or die. • Many Parkinson's disease symptoms are caused by a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain. • This messenger is called dopamine. • Decreased dopamine leads to irregular brain activity. • This causes movement problems and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease. • People with Parkinson's disease also lose a chemical messenger called norepinephrine that controls many body functions, such as blood pressure. • The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors seem to play a role, including: Genes. • Specific genetic changes are linked to Parkinson's disease. • But these are rare unless many family members have had Parkinson's disease. • Environmental factors. • Exposure to certain toxins or other environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease. • One example is MPTP, a substance that can be found in illegal drugs and is sometimes sold illegally as \"synthetic heroin.\" Other examples include pesticides and well water used for drinking. • But no environmental factor has proved to be a cause. • Many changes happen in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. • Researchers are studying why the changes happen and the roles they play. • These changes include: The presence of Lewy bodies. • Clumps of proteins in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease. • These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these proteins hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease. • Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies. • Alpha-synuclein is a protein found in all Lewy bodies. • It occurs in a clumped form that cells can't break down. • This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers. • Alpha-synuclein has been found in the spinal fluid of people who later have Parkinson's disease. • Altered mitochondria. • Mitochondria are powerhouse compartments inside cells that create most of the body's energy. • Changes to mitochondria can cause cell damage. • These changes have been found in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. • Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include: Age. • The risk of Parkinson's disease increases with age. • Usually, it starts around age 50 or older. • The average age of onset is around age 70. • Parkinson's disease can occur in younger adults, but it is rare. • When people younger than age 50 have the disease, it's known as early-onset Parkinson's disease. • Genetics. • Having one or more first-degree relatives, such as parents or siblings, with Parkinson's disease increases your risk. • Your risks are still small unless you have many blood relatives with the condition. • Male sex. • Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women. • Exposure to toxins. • Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinson's disease. • People with Parkinson's disease may have other complications that may be treatable. • These may include: Trouble thinking clearly. • Parkinson's disease can affect people's memory, language and reasoning skills. • The disease also can lead to dementia or other conditions that affect thinking. • These complications usually happen later in Parkinson's disease, and medicines usually have only a modest benefit in managing these symptoms. • Emotional changes and depression. • Some people may feel irritable and concerned early in the course of Parkinson's disease. • They also may have depression and anxiety. • Medicines and other treatment can help with these changes. • Trouble swallowing and chewing. • Late-stage Parkinson's disease affects the muscles in the mouth. • This causes trouble swallowing and chewing, which can lead to not getting enough nutrients in your diet. • If food or saliva collects in the mouth, it can cause choking or drooling. • Sleep problems and sleep disorders. • You may wake up often during the night, have nightmares and fall asleep during the day. • Another symptom may be rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. • This involves acting out your dreams. • Medicines and other therapies may help your sleep get better. • Other symptoms that can occur include: Bladder problems. • You may have problems such as urgency. • Constipation. • You may have a hard time passing stool. • You may pass stool fewer than three times a week. • Blood pressure changes. • You may feel dizzy or lightheaded or even faint when you stand up due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. • This also is called orthostatic hypotension. • Loss of smell. • You may fully or partially lose your sense of smell. • Tiredness. • You may feel very tired and lack energy, especially late in the day. • Pain. • You may have pain or cramps in your muscles and joints. • Sexual symptoms. • You may have a decrease in sexual desire or performance. • Because the cause of Parkinson's disease is not known, there are no proven ways to prevent it. • Research shows that some factors may help protect against it. • But scientists don't know for sure. • These factors include: Exercise. • Aerobic exercise has been linked to a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. • Caffeine. • Some studies show a link between drinking caffeinated beverages such as coffee and green tea and a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. • Medicines. • Some medicines, such as

      "Overview": "Patellofemoral (puh-tel-o-FEM-uh-rul) pain syndrome is pain at the front of the knee, around the kneecap. • The kneecap also is known as the patella. • Patellofemoral pain syndrome is sometimes called runner's knee. • It's more common in people who run and who play sports that involve running and jumping. • The knee pain often increases when running, walking up or down stairs, sitting for long periods, or squatting. • Simple treatments, such as rest and ice, often help. • But sometimes patellofemoral pain needs physical therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee. • The following can increase the pain: Walking up or down stairs. • Kneeling or squatting. • Sitting with a bent knee for long periods of time. • If the knee pain doesn't improve within a few days or it gets harder to move the knee, call your health care provider.",
      "Causes": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome can have several causes. • It's been linked with: Overuse. • Running or jumping sports put repeated stress on the knee joint, which can cause irritation under the kneecap. • Muscle imbalances or weaknesses. • Patellofemoral pain can occur when the muscles around the hip and knee don't keep the kneecap in line. • Moving the knee inward during a squat has been linked to patellofemoral pain. • Injury. • Trauma to the kneecap, such as when the kneecap gets out of place or breaks, has been linked to patellofemoral pain syndrome. • Surgery. • Knee surgery can increase the risk of patellofemoral pain. • This is especially true of repair to the anterior cruciate ligament using one's own patellar tendon as a graft.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase your risk include: Age. • Patellofemoral pain syndrome typically affects teens and young adults. • Arthritis is more often to blame for knee problems in older people. • Sex. • Women are twice as likely as men are to develop patellofemoral pain. • This may be because women have wider pelvises. • A wider pelvis increases the angle at which the bones in the knee joint meet. • Certain sports. • Running and jumping sports can put extra stress on the knees. • This is especially true when adding more training.",
      "Prevention": "Sometimes knee pain just happens. • But certain steps may help prevent the pain. • Build strength. • Strong leg and hip muscles help keep the knee balanced during activity. • Avoid deep squatting during weight training. • Move safely. • Ask a physical therapist about exercises to help you jump, run and turn correctly. • It's especially important to strengthen outer hip muscles. • This will help keep your knee from caving inward when you squat, land from a jump or step down from a step. • Lose excess pounds. • If you're overweight, losing weight relieves stress on the knees. • Warm up. • Before running or doing other exercise, warm up with five minutes or so of light activity. • Stretch. • Promote flexibility with gentle stretching exercises. • Build up slowly. • Don't suddenly increase your workouts. • Mind your shoes. • Wear shoes that fit well and are designed for the activity."

      "Overview": "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. • An opening called the ductus arteriosus is part of the blood flow system in the womb for an unborn baby, also called a fetus. • It usually closes shortly after birth. • If the opening remains open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. • A PDA is a type of congenital heart defect. • A small PDA might never need treatment. • But a large, untreated patent ductus arteriosus can let oxygen-poor blood move the wrong way. • This can make the heart muscle weak, causing heart failure and other complications. • Treatments for patent ductus arteriosus may include regular health checkups, medicines, and a procedure or surgery to close the opening.",
      "Symptoms": "Patent ductus arteriosus symptoms (PDA) depend on the size of the opening and the person's age. • A small PDA might not cause symptoms. • Some people don't notice symptoms until adulthood. • A large PDA can cause symptoms of heart failure soon after birth. • A large PDA found during infancy or childhood might cause: Poor eating, which leads to poor growth. • Sweating with crying or eating. • Constant fast breathing or being out of breath. • Easy tiring. • Rapid heart rate. • Contact a healthcare professional if your baby or older child: Tires easily when eating or playing. • Isn't gaining weight. • Becomes breathless when eating or crying. • Always breathes fast or is short of breath.",
      "Causes": "The exact causes of patent ductus arteriosus and other congenital heart defects are not clear. • During the first six weeks of pregnancy, an unborn baby's heart starts to form and beat. • The major blood vessels to and from the heart grow. • It's during this time that certain congenital heart defects may begin to develop. • Before birth, there is a temporary opening called the ductus arteriosus between the two main blood vessels leaving a baby's heart. • Those vessels are the aorta and the pulmonary artery. • The opening is needed for a baby's blood flow before birth. • It moves blood away from a baby's lungs while they develop. • The baby gets oxygen from the mother's blood. • After birth, the ductus arteriosus is no longer needed. • It usually closes within 2 to 3 days. • But in some infants, the opening doesn't close. • When it stays open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. • The constant opening causes too much blood to flow to the baby's lungs and heart. • Untreated, the blood pressure in the baby's lungs might increase. • The baby's heart might grow larger and get weak.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) include: Premature birth. • Patent ductus arteriosus occurs more commonly in babies who are born too early than in babies who are born full term. • Family history and other genetic conditions. • A family history of heart conditions present at birth may increase the risk of PDA. • Babies born with an extra chromosome 21, a condition called Down syndrome, also are more likely to have patent ductus arteriosus. • German measles during pregnancy. • Having German measles, also called rubella, during pregnancy can cause changes in an unborn baby's heart. • A blood test done before pregnancy can tell if you're immune to rubella. • A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune. • Being born at a high altitude. • Babies born above 8,200 feet (2,499 meters) have a greater risk of PDA than babies born at lower altitudes. • Female sex assigned at birth. • Patent ductus arteriosus is twice as common in girls.",
      "Complications": "A small patent ductus arteriosus might not cause complications. • Larger, untreated PDAs could cause: High blood pressure in the lungs, also called pulmonary hypertension. • A large PDA causes irregular blood flow in the heart and lungs. • As a result, pressure goes up in the pulmonary artery. • Over time, the increased pressure damages the smaller blood vessels in the lungs. • A life-threatening and lasting type of lung damage called Eisenmenger syndrome may occur. • Heart failure. • Symptoms of this serious complication include rapid breathing, often with gasping breaths, and poor weight gain. • Heart infection, called endocarditis. • Patent ductus arteriosus can increase the risk of germs attaching to areas in the heart. • Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. • It may be possible to have a successful pregnancy with a small patent ductus arteriosus. • However, having a large PDA or a complication such as heart failure, lung damage or irregular heartbeats increases the risk of serious complications during pregnancy. • Before becoming pregnant, talk with your healthcare professional about possible pregnancy risks and complications. • Some heart medicines can be dangerous for an unborn baby. • Your healthcare professional may stop or change your medicines before you become pregnant. • Together you can plan for any special care needed during pregnancy. • If you are at high risk of having a baby with a heart condition present at birth, genetic testing and screening may be done during pregnancy.",
      "Prevention": "There is no known prevention for patent ductus arteriosus. • However, it's important to do everything possible to have a healthy pregnancy. • Here are some of the basics: Get early prenatal care, even before you're pregnant. • If you're thinking about pregnancy, talk with your healthcare team to develop a prenatal care plan. • Also tell your healthcare professional about all the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. • Start taking folic acid. • Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before and during pregnancy has been shown to reduce brain and spinal cord conditions in the baby. • It also may help reduce the risk of heart conditions. • Exercise and stay active. • Work with your healthcare professional to develop an exercise plan that's right for you. • Do not drink alcohol or smoke. • These lifestyle habits can harm a baby's health. • Also avoid secondhand smoke. • Get recommended vaccines. • Update your vaccinations before becoming pregnant. • Certain types of infections can be harmful to a developing baby. • Control blood sugar. • If you have diabetes, good control of your blood sugar may reduce the risk of certain heart conditions present at birth in your baby."

      "Overview": "Peanut allergy is a condition that causes the body's germ-fighting immune system to react to peanuts. • It's one of the most common causes of a life-threatening allergic reaction to food. • This life-threatening reaction is known as anaphylaxis. • Peanut allergy has been increasing in children. • Even if you or your child has shown only a mild reaction to peanuts, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional. • There is still a risk of a more serious future reaction.",
      "Symptoms": "An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure. • Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include: Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling. • Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat. • Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting. • Tightening of the throat. • Shortness of breath or wheezing. • Runny nose. • Peanut allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis due to food. • This medical emergency requires treatment with an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) and a trip to the emergency room. • Epinephrine is a kind of adrenaline. • Anaphylaxis signs and symptoms can include: Constriction of airways. • Swelling of the lips, tongue and throat that makes it hard to breathe. • A severe drop in blood pressure, also known as shock. • Rapid pulse. • Dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. • Talk to your care team if you have had any signs or symptoms of peanut allergy. • Seek emergency treatment if you have a severe reaction to peanuts. • Call, or have someone else call 911 or your local emergency number if you have any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis such as: Severe dizziness. • Severe trouble breathing. • Loss of consciousness.",
      "Causes": "Peanut allergy occurs when the immune system flags peanut proteins as harmful. • When exposed to peanuts, the immune system releases symptom-causing chemicals into the bloodstream. • These chemicals cause an allergic reaction. • Direct and cross-contact with peanuts could cause a reaction: Direct contact. • The most common cause of peanut allergy is eating peanuts or foods that contain peanuts. • Cross-contact. • This happens when peanuts get into a product by mistake. • It often happens when food is exposed to peanuts during processing or handling. • Inhalation. • Breathing in dust or aerosols containing peanuts, such as peanut flour, may cause an allergic reaction.",
      "Risk factors": "It isn't clear why some people develop allergies while others don't. • However, people with certain risk factors have a greater chance of developing peanut allergy. • Peanut allergy risk factors include: Age. • Food allergies are most common in children, especially toddlers and infants. • As a person grows, the digestive system matures. • Then the body is less likely to react to food that triggers allergies. • Past allergy to peanuts. • Some children with peanut allergy outgrow it, though it can recur. • So be cautious even if you seem to have outgrown peanut allergy. • Other allergies. • If you're already allergic to one food, you have a higher risk of being allergic to another. • Also, having another type of allergy, such as hay fever, raises your risk of having a food allergy. • Family members with allergies. • Your risk of peanut allergy is higher if other allergies are common in your family, especially other food allergies. • Atopic dermatitis. • Some people with the skin condition atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, have a food allergy as well.",
      "Complications": "Complications of peanut allergy can include anaphylaxis. • Children and adults who have a severe peanut allergy are especially at risk of having this life-threatening reaction.",
      "Prevention": "Studies have shown a strong link between early peanut exposure and lower food allergy risk. • In the studies, peanuts were introduced to high-risk babies and children from 4 months to 3 years old. • By doing so, their food allergy risk was reduced up to 80%. • Children at risk of peanut allergy include those with mild to severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. • Before introducing your child to peanuts, discuss the best approach with your child's healthcare professional."

      "Overview": "Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the person's breastbone is sunken into the chest. • In severe cases, pectus excavatum can look as if the center of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent. • While the sunken breastbone is often noticeable shortly after birth, the severity of pectus excavatum typically worsens during the adolescent growth spurt. • Also called funnel chest, pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls. • Severe cases of pectus excavatum can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs. • But even mild cases of pectus excavatum can make children feel self-conscious about their appearance. • Surgery can correct the deformity.",
      "Symptoms": "For many people with pectus excavatum, the only sign or symptom is a slight indentation in their chests. • In some people, the depth of the indentation worsens in early adolescence and can continue to worsen into adulthood. • In severe cases of pectus excavatum, the breastbone may compress the lungs and heart. • Signs and symptoms may include: Decreased exercise tolerance Rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations Recurrent respiratory infections Wheezing or coughing Chest pain Heart murmur Fatigue Dizziness",
      "Causes": "While the exact cause of pectus excavatum is unknown, it may be an inherited condition because it sometimes runs in families.",
      "Risk factors": "Pectus excavatum is more common in boys than in girls. • It also occurs more often in people who also have: Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Osteogenesis imperfecta Noonan syndrome Turner syndrome",
      "Complications": "Severe cases of pectus excavatum can compress the heart and lungs or push the heart over to one side. • Even mild cases of pectus excavatum can result in self-image problems. • If the depth of the breastbone indentation is severe, it may reduce the amount of room the lungs have to expand. • This compression can also squeeze the heart, pushing it into the left side of the chest and reducing its ability to pump efficiently. • This can cause symptoms such as exercise intolerance, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and chest pain or pressure. • Many people who have pectus excavatum will also tend to have a hunched-forward posture, with flared ribs and shoulder blades. • Many are so self-conscious about their appearance that they avoid activities where their chest can be seen, such as swimming. • They may also avoid clothing that makes the indentation in their chests more difficult to camouflage."

      "Overview": "Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which a child's breathing is partly or completely blocked during sleep. • Breathing can briefly stop and start again many times a night. • The condition happens when the upper airway narrows or is blocked during sleep. • Obstructive sleep apnea can look different in children than it does in adults. • Adults usually have daytime sleepiness. • Children are more likely to have behavior issues, such as acting hyper or not paying attention. • Risk factors also differ. • In adults, the key risk factors are obesity and age. • Although obesity can play a role in children, the main risk factor in children is having tonsils and adenoids that are larger than usual. • The adenoids are two small pads of tissue in the back of the nose. • The tonsils are two oval-shaped pads in the back of the mouth. • It's important for healthcare professionals to find and treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea as soon as possible. • Early treatment helps prevent other health conditions called complications. • These can affect children's growth, learning, behavior and heart health. • The first treatment may be surgery to remove enlarged tonsils and adenoids. • But some children may get better using medical devices or taking medicines.",
      "Symptoms": "During sleep, symptoms of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can include: Snoring. • Pauses in breathing. • Restless sleep. • Snorting, gasping, coughing or choking. • Mouth breathing. • Nighttime sweating. • Bed-wetting that starts after a long period of dry overnights. • Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. • They might just have disturbed sleep. • During the day, children with sleep apnea might: Get headaches in the morning. • Breathe through the mouth or have trouble breathing through the nose. • Have trouble learning and paying attention. • Do poorly in school. • Have behavior issues such as acting hyper, impulsive or aggressive. • Have poor weight gain. • Talk about feeling sleepy, or fall asleep during school or during short car or bus rides. • See your child's healthcare professional if your child has any symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, including frequent snoring.",
      "Causes": "Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is caused by muscles in the back of the throat relaxing and blocking the upper airway. • In children, this leads to pauses in breathing that last about twice as long as the typical breath. • When breathing stops, this triggers the brain to wake up so that the airway can open again. • This makes it hard to get enough rest. • Various conditions can raise the risk of the upper airway becoming blocked during sleep. • Commonly, enlarged tonsils in the back of the mouth and enlarged adenoids in the back of the nose can cause a blockage. • Other possible causes include being born with a birth defect related to the shape of the face or head and certain health conditions.",
      "Risk factors": "The main risk factor for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids, especially in younger children. • Obesity also is an important a risk factor, mainly among teenagers. • Other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having: A genetic condition such as Down syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome. • Birth defects in the skull or face. • A group of conditions called cerebral palsy that affect movement and posture. • A group of inherited blood disorders known as sickle cell disease. • Conditions called neuromuscular disorders that affect the function of muscles due to problems with the nerves and muscles in the body. • A history of low birth weight. • A family history of obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "Complications": "Without treatment, pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can lead to other health conditions called complications. • Rarely, pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can cause infants and young children not to grow as much as those who don't have the condition. • Children who don't receive treatment also may have a higher risk of later complications such as: High blood pressure. • High cholesterol. • A higher than typical blood sugar level that raises the risk of diabetes. • Other heart and blood vessel conditions. • Very rarely, children with certain genetic conditions can have serious symptoms of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. • These symptoms can lead to death. • But in most children, treatment can help manage complications."

      "Overview": "Your body produces white blood cells (leukocytes), which help fight bacterial infections, viruses and fungi. • If your child has too few or too many white blood cells, in general, here's what it means: Low white blood cell count (leukopenia) means having too few leukocytes circulating in the blood. • A long-term low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections and may be caused by a number of different diseases and conditions. • High white blood cell count (leukocytosis) means having too many leukocytes circulating in the blood, usually from having an infection. • A number of different diseases and conditions may cause a long-term high white blood cell count. • There are several types of white blood cells, each with a different disease-fighting activity. • The main types are: Neutrophils Lymphocytes Monocytes Eosinophils Basophils White blood cell disorders involving a specific type of white blood cell include: Neutropenia. • Neutropenia (noo-troe-PEE-nee-uh) is a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infections of fungi and bacteria. • Neutropenia can be caused by cancer or by diseases, disorders or infections that damage bone marrow. • In addition, certain medications and other diseases or conditions can cause neutropenia. • Lymphocytopenia. • Lymphocytopenia (lim-foe-sie-toe-PEE-nee-uh) is a decrease in lymphocytes, the type of white blood cell that, among other tasks, protects your body from viral infections. • Lymphocytopenia can result from an inherited syndrome, be associated with certain diseases, or be a side effect from medications or other treatments. • Monocyte disorders. • Monocytes help get rid of dead or damaged tissue and regulate your body's immune response. • Infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions can cause an increased number of monocytes. • A decreased number can be the result of toxins, chemotherapy and other causes. • Eosinophilia. • Eosinophilia (e-o-sin-o-FIL-e-uh) is a higher than normal number of eosinophil cells, a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. • Eosinophilia can be caused by a variety of conditions and disorders, most commonly by an allergic reaction or a parasitic infection. • Basophilic disorders. • Basophils account for only a small number of white blood cells, but they have a role in wound healing, infection and allergic reactions. • A decreased number of basophils can result from allergic reactions or infections. • An increased number can be caused by certain types of blood cancer or other disorders."

      "Overview": "Pelvic organ prolapse is when one or more pelvic organs drop from their position. • This makes a bulge in the vagina, called a prolapse. • The muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor typically hold the pelvic organs in place. • Pelvic organs include the vagina, bladder, uterus, urethra and rectum. • Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues of the pelvic floor weaken. • This may be due to pregnancy, childbirth or menopause. • Pelvic organ prolapse can be treated. • Often, nonsurgical treatment helps. • Sometimes, surgery might be needed to put the pelvic organs back in place.",
      "Symptoms": "Sometimes, pelvic organ prolapse has no symptoms. • When symptoms happen, they might include: Seeing or feeling a bulge of tissue at or beyond the opening of the vagina. • Pelvic pressure, heaviness or pain. • Lower back pain. • Not being able to keep in a tampon. • Urinary changes. • These might include urinating more, feeling an urgent need to urinate, not being able to empty the bladder all the way or having a weak urine stream. • Bowel changes, such as not emptying stool all the way or having to put fingers in the vagina to support the bulge to be able to pass stool. • This is called splinting. • Sexual issues, such as pain with sex. • Weakness of the pelvic floor often affects more than one area. • For instance, if one of your pelvic organs is prolapsed, you're more likely to have another type of pelvic organ prolapse. • The cause of pelvic organ prolapse is the weakening of the tissues and the muscles that support the pelvic organs. • The most common cause is having a baby vaginally. • Risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse include: Having more than one baby, vaginal delivery, high birth weight babies and deliveries using tools. • Being older. • Being obese. • Having had pelvic surgery. • Straining from an ongoing cough, such as from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ongoing constipation or ongoing heavy lifting. • Having a family history of pelvic organ prolapse or connective tissue conditions.",

      "Overview": "Pemphigus is a group of rare skin disorders that cause blisters and sores on the skin or mucous membranes, such as in the mouth or on the genitals. • It's most common in people middle-aged or older. • Pemphigus is easier to control if caught and treated early. • It's usually treated with medicines that you take long term. • The sores may heal slowly or not at all. • The condition can become life-threatening if the sores become infected.",
      "Symptoms": "Pemphigus causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. • The blisters break easily, leaving open sores. • The sores may become infected and ooze. • The symptoms of two common types of pemphigus are as follows: Pemphigus vulgaris. • This type usually begins with blisters in the mouth and then on the skin or genital mucous membranes. • They're often painful but don't itch. • Blisters in the mouth or throat may make it hard to talk, drink and eat. • Pemphigus foliaceus. • This type causes blisters on the chest, back and shoulders. • The blisters may be itchy or painful. • Pemphigus foliaceus doesn't cause mouth blisters. • Pemphigus is distinct from bullous pemphigoid, which is another type of blistering skin condition that affects older adults. • See a healthcare professional if you have blisters that don't heal in the mouth or on the skin or genital mucous membranes.",
      "Causes": "Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder, which means that your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in your body. • With pemphigus the immune system attacks cells in the skin and mucous membranes. • Pemphigus isn't passed from one person to another. • In most cases, it's unknown what causes the disease to arise. • Rarely, the disease can develop as a side effect of medicines, like penicillamine and certain blood pressure drugs. • This type of the condition usually clears up when the medicine is stopped.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of pemphigus increases if you're middle-aged or older. • The condition also is more common in people of Jewish, Indian, southeast European or Middle Eastern ancestry.",
      "Complications": "Possible complications of pemphigus include: Infection of the skin. • Infection that spreads to your bloodstream, also called sepsis. • This type of infection can be life-threatening. • Scarring and changes in skin color after the affected skin heals. • This is called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation when the skin darkens and postinflammatory hypopigmentation when the skin loses color. • People with brown or Black skin have a higher risk of long-term skin color changes. • Malnutrition, because painful mouth sores make it difficult to eat. • Side effects from the medicine used to treat pemphigus. • Examples are high blood pressure and infection. • Death, rarely, if certain types of pemphigus are left untreated."

      "Overview": "Perimenopause means \"around menopause\" and refers to the time during which your body makes the natural transition to menopause, marking the end of the reproductive years. • Perimenopause is also called the menopausal transition. • Women start perimenopause at different ages. • You may notice signs of progression toward menopause, such as menstrual irregularity, sometime in your 40s. • But some women notice changes as early as their mid-30s. • The level of estrogen — the main female hormone — in your body rises and falls unevenly during perimenopause. • Your menstrual cycles may lengthen or shorten, and you may begin having menstrual cycles in which your ovaries don't release an egg (ovulate). • You may also experience menopause-like symptoms, such as hot flashes, sleep problems and vaginal dryness. • Treatments are available to help ease these symptoms. • Once you've gone through 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period, you've officially reached menopause, and the perimenopause period is over.",
      "Symptoms": "Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. • You might experience: Irregular periods. • As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. • If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. • If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. • Hot flashes and sleep problems. • Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. • The intensity, length and frequency vary. • Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. • Mood changes. • Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. • The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. • Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. • Vaginal and bladder problems. • When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. • Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. • Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. • Decreasing fertility. • As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. • However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. • If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. • Changes in sexual function. • During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. • But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. • Loss of bone. • With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. • Changing cholesterol levels. • Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. • At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the \"good\" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease. • Some women seek medical attention for their perimenopausal symptoms. • But others either tolerate the changes or simply don't experience symptoms severe enough to need attention. • Because symptoms may be subtle and come on gradually, you may not realize at first that they're all connected to the same thing — hormone fluctuations of the menopausal transition. • If you have symptoms that interfere with your life or well-being, such as hot flashes, mood swings or changes in sexual function that concern you, see your doctor. • As you go through perimenopause, your body's production of estrogen and progesterone, key female hormones, rises and falls. • Many of the changes you experience during perimenopause are a result of decreasing estrogen. • Menopause is a normal phase in life. • But it may occur earlier in some women than in others. • Although not always conclusive, some evidence suggests that certain factors may make it more likely that you start perimenopause at an earlier age, including: Smoking. • The onset of menopause occurs 1 to 2 years earlier in women who smoke than in women who don't smoke. • Family history. • Women with a family history of early menopause may experience early menopause themselves. • Cancer treatment. • Treatment for cancer with chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy has been linked to early menopause. • Hysterectomy. • A hysterectomy that removes your uterus, but not your ovaries, usually doesn't cause menopause. • Although you no longer have periods, your ovaries still produce estrogen. • But such surgery may cause menopause to occur earlier than average. • Also, if you have one ovary removed, the remaining ovary might stop working sooner than expected. • Irregular periods are a hallmark of perimenopause. • Most of the time this is normal and nothing to be concerned about. • However, see your doctor if: Bleeding is extremely heavy — you're changing tampons or pads every hour or two for two or more hours Bleeding lasts longer than seven days Bleeding occurs between periods Periods regularly occur less than 21 days apart Signs such as these may mean there's a problem with your reproductive system that requires diagnosis and treatment.",

      "Symptoms": "Healthy gums are firm and fit snugly around teeth. • The color of healthy gums can vary. • They may range from light pink in some people to dark pink and brown in others. • Symptoms of periodontitis can include: Swollen or puffy gums. • Bright red, dark red or dark purple gums. • Gums that feel tender when touched. • Gums that bleed easily. • A toothbrush that looks pink after brushing your teeth. • Spitting out blood when brushing or flossing your teeth. • Bad breath that won't go away. • Pus between your teeth and gums. • Loose teeth or loss of teeth. • Painful chewing. • New spaces that develop between your teeth that look like black triangles. • Gums that pull away from your teeth, making your teeth look longer than usual, called receding gums. • A change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite. • Follow your dentist's recommended schedule for regular checkups. • If you notice any symptoms of periodontitis, make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. • The sooner you get care, the better your chances of reversing damage from periodontitis. • In most cases, the development of periodontitis starts with plaque. • Plaque is a sticky film mainly made up of bacteria. • If not treated, here's how plaque can advance over time to periodontitis: Plaque forms on your teeth when starches and sugars in food interact with bacteria commonly found in your mouth. • Brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day removes plaque, but plaque quickly comes back. • Plaque can harden under your gumline into tartar if it stays on your teeth. • Tartar is more difficult to remove. • You can't get rid of it by brushing and flossing — you need a professional dental cleaning to remove it. • Because plaque and tartar are filled with bacteria, the longer they stay on your teeth, the more damage they can do. • Plaque can cause gingivitis, the mildest form of gum disease. • Gingivitis is irritation and swelling of the gum tissue around the base of your teeth. • Gingiva is another word for gum tissue. • Gingivitis can be reversed with professional treatment and good home oral care, but only if treated early before you have bone loss. • Ongoing gum irritation and swelling, called inflammation, can cause periodontitis. • Eventually this causes deep pockets to form between your gums and teeth. • These pockets fill with plaque, tartar and bacteria and become deeper over time. • If not treated, these deep infections cause a loss of tissue and bone. • Eventually you may lose one or more teeth. • Also, ongoing inflammation can put a strain on your immune system, causing other health problems. • Factors that can increase your risk of periodontitis include: Gingivitis. • Poor oral health care habits. • Smoking or chewing tobacco. • Hormonal changes, such as those related to pregnancy or menopause. • Recreational drug use, such as smoking marijuana or vaping. • Obesity. • Poor nutrition, including a low vitamin C level. • Genetics. • Certain medicines that cause dry mouth or gum changes. • Conditions that lower immunity, such as leukemia, HIV/AIDS and cancer treatment. • Certain diseases, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. • Periodontitis can cause tooth loss. • The bacteria that cause periodontitis can enter your bloodstream through gum tissue, possibly affecting other parts of your body. • For example, periodontitis is linked with respiratory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, preterm birth and low birth weight, and problems controlling blood sugar in diabetes. • The best way to prevent periodontitis is to get into the habit of taking good care of your mouth and teeth. • Start this routine at a young age and keep it throughout life. • Good oral care. • This means brushing your teeth for two minutes at least twice a day — in the morning and before going to bed — and flossing at least once a day. • Flossing before you brush allows you to clean away the loosened food bits and bacteria. • Good oral care keeps your teeth and gums clean and removes the bacteria that cause periodontal disease. • Regular dental visits. • See your dentist regularly for cleanings, usually every 6 to 12 months. • If you have risk factors that increase your chance of developing periodontitis — such as having dry mouth, taking certain medicines or smoking — you may need professional cleaning more often.",

      "Overview": "Peripheral nerves send messages from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. • They help do things such as move the body's muscles for walking and sense that the feet are cold. • Peripheral nerves are made of fibers called axons that are insulated by surrounding tissues. • Peripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged. • A nerve injury can affect the brain's ability to communicate with muscles and organs. • Damage to the peripheral nerves is called peripheral neuropathy. • It's important to get medical care for a peripheral nerve injury as soon as possible. • Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and permanent damage.",
      "Symptoms": "With a peripheral nerve injury, symptoms may range from mild to serious, limiting your daily activities. • Your symptoms often depend on which nerve fibers are damaged: Motor nerves. • These nerves regulate all the muscles under your conscious control, such as those used for walking, talking and holding objects. • Damage to these nerves can cause muscle weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching. • Sensory nerves. • Because these nerves relay information about touch, temperature and pain, you may experience a variety of symptoms. • These include numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. • You may have trouble walking, keeping your balance with your eyes closed, fastening buttons, or sensing pain or changes in temperature. • Injury of sensory nerves also may cause pain. • Autonomic (aw-tuh-NOM-ik) nerves. • This group of nerves regulates activities that are not controlled consciously, such as breathing, heart and thyroid function, and digestion. • Symptoms may include excessive sweating, changes in blood pressure, the inability to tolerate heat and gastrointestinal symptoms. • Many peripheral nerve injuries affect more than one type of nerve fiber, so you may experience a range of symptoms. • If you experience weakness, tingling, numbness or a total loss of feeling, see your healthcare professional to find out the cause. • It's important to treat peripheral nerve injuries early.",
      "Causes": "Peripheral nerves can be damaged in several ways: Injury from an accident, a fall or sports can stretch, compress, crush or cut nerves. • Medical conditions, such as diabetes, Guillain-Barre syndrome and carpal tunnel syndrome, can damage nerves. • Autoimmune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome also can damage nerves. • Other causes include narrowing of the arteries, changes in hormone balance and tumors.",
      "Risk factors": "People who experience physical trauma or play sports may be at higher risk of an injury that can stretch or crush peripheral nerves. • People with certain medical conditions also may be at higher risk of peripheral nerve injuries. • These conditions, especially diabetes, may put nerves at greater risk of compression."

      "Overview": "Peripheral neuropathy happens when the nerves that are located outside of the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerves) are damaged. • This condition often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet. • It also can affect other areas and body functions including digestion and urination. • The peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the central nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. • The peripheral nerves also send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves. • Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. • One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes. • People with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. • Sometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated. • Medicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.",
      "Symptoms": "Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. • Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. • Nerves are divided into: Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin. • Motor nerves that control muscle movement. • Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function. • Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include: Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. • These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms. • Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain. • Extreme sensitivity to touch. • Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket. • Lack of coordination and falling. • Muscle weakness. • Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not. • Inability to move if motor nerves are affected. • If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include: Heat intolerance. • Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat. • Bowel, bladder or digestive problems. • Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness. • Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. • If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. • Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. • Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy. • Seek medical care right away if you notice unusual tingling, weakness, or pain in your hands or feet. • Early diagnosis and treatment give you the best chance for controlling your symptoms and preventing further damage to your peripheral nerves. • Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by several different conditions. • Health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include: Autoimmune diseases. • These include Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitis. • Also, some cancers related to the body's immune system can cause polyneuropathy. • These are a form of autoimmune disorder called paraneoplastic syndrome. • Diabetes and metabolic syndrome. • This is the most common cause. • Among people with diabetes, more than half will develop some type of neuropathy. • Infections. • These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, shingles, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV. • Inherited disorders. • Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types of neuropathy that run in families. • Tumors. • Cancerous growths, also called malignant, and noncancerous growths, also called benign, can grow on or press on nerves. • Bone marrow disorders. • These include a protein in the blood that isn't usually there, called monoclonal gammopathies, a rare form of myeloma that affects the bones, lymphoma and the rare disease amyloidosis. • Other diseases. • These include metabolic conditions such as kidney disease or liver disease, and an underactive thyroid, also known as hypothyroidism. • Other causes of neuropathies include: Alcohol use disorder. • Unhealthy dietary choices made by people with alcohol use disorder, also known as alcoholism, and poor absorption of vitamins can lead to low amounts of essential vitamins in the body. • Exposure to poisons. • Toxic substances include industrial chemicals and heavy metals such as lead and mercury. • Medicines. • Certain medicines, especially chemotherapy used to treat cancer, can cause peripheral neuropathy. • Injury or pressure on the nerve. • Injuries, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. • Nerve pressure can result from having a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times. • Low vitamin levels. • B vitamins, including B-1, B-6 and B-12, as well as copper and vitamin E are crucial to nerve health. • In some cases, no cause can be identified. • This is called idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. • Peripheral neuropathy risk factors include: Diabetes, especially if your sugar levels are not controlled well. • Alcohol misuse. • Low levels of vitamins in the body, especially vitamin B-12. • Infections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, hepatitis B and C, and HIV. • Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system attacks your own tissues. • Kidney, liver or thyroid disorders. • Exposure to toxins. • Repetitive motion, such as those performed for certain jobs. • Family history of neuropathy. • Complications of peripheral neuropathy can include: Burns, skin injuries and wounds on the feet. • You might not feel temperature changes or pain on parts of your body that are numb. • Infection. • Your feet and other areas that lack sensation can become injured without your knowing. • Check these areas regularly, wear close-toed, well-fitting shoes and treat minor injuries before they become infected, especially if you have diabetes. • Falls. • Weakness and loss of sensation may be associated with lack of balance and falling. • Installing handrails in the bathroom, using canes or walkers when needed, and ensuring that you are walking only in well-lit rooms can decrease fall risk. • The best way to prevent peripheral neuropathy is to manage medical conditions that put you at risk. • These habits support your nerve health: Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein to keep nerves healthy. • Protect against low levels of vitamin B-12 by eating meats, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy foods and fortified cereals. • If you're vegetarian or vegan, fortified cereals are a good source of vitamin B-12, but talk to your health care professional about B-12 supplements. • Exercise regularly. • With a health care professional's OK, try to get at least 30 minutes to one hour of exercise at least three times a week. • Avoid factors that may cause nerve damage. • These factors can include repetitive motions, exposure to toxic chemicals, smoking and drinking too much alcohol.",

      "Overview": "Peritonitis is a serious condition that starts in the abdomen. • That's the area of the body between the chest and the pelvis. • Peritonitis happens when the thin layer of tissue inside the abdomen becomes inflamed. • The tissue layer is called the peritoneum. • Peritonitis usually happens due to an infection from bacteria or fungi. • There are two types of peritonitis: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. • This infection is caused by bacteria. • It can happen when someone has liver disease, such as cirrhosis, or kidney disease. • Secondary peritonitis. • Peritonitis can happen due to a hole, also called a rupture, inside an organ in the abdomen. • Or it can be caused by other health conditions. • It's important to get treatment fast for peritonitis. • Health care providers have ways to clear out the infection. • They also can treat any medical problem that might be causing it. • Peritonitis treatment usually involves medicines that are used for infections caused by bacteria, called antibiotics. • Some people with peritonitis need surgery. • If you don't get treatment, peritonitis can lead to a serious infection that spreads through the body. • It can be deadly. • A common cause of peritonitis is a treatment for kidney failure called peritoneal dialysis. • This treatment helps get rid of waste products from the blood when the kidneys struggle to do that job themselves. • If you get peritoneal dialysis, you can help prevent peritonitis with good hygiene before, during and after dialysis. • For example, it's important to wash your hands and clean the skin around your catheter.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of peritonitis include: Belly pain or tenderness. • Bloating or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen. • Fever. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Loss of appetite. • Diarrhea. • Reduced urine. • Thirst. • Not able to pass stool or gas. • Feeling tired. • Confusion. • If you get peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis symptoms also may include: Cloudy dialysis fluid. • White flecks, strands or clumps — which are called fibrin — in the dialysis fluid. • Peritonitis can be life-threatening if you don't get treatment quickly. • Call your health care provider right away if you have severe pain or tenderness of your abdomen, bloating or a feeling of fullness along with: Fever. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Reduced urine. • Thirst. • Not able to pass stool or gas. • If you get peritoneal dialysis, call your health care provider right away if your dialysis fluid: Is cloudy or has an unusual color. • Has white flecks in it. • Has strands or clumps in it. • Smells unusual, especially if the area around your catheter is changes color or is painful. • Peritonitis also might happen after a burst appendix or a serious injury to your abdomen Get medical help right away if you have severe belly pain. • It may feel so bad that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position. • Call 911 or get emergency medical care if you have severe belly pain after an accident or injury. • Peritoneum infection is usually caused by a hole in an organ in the abdomen, such as the stomach and colon. • The hole is also called a rupture. • It's rare for peritonitis to happen for other causes. • Common causes of a hole that leads to peritonitis include: Medical procedures Peritoneal dialysis uses tubes, also called catheters, to remove waste products from the blood. • An infection may happen during peritoneal dialysis due to an unclean treatment room, poor hygiene or tainted equipment. • Peritonitis also may happen after digestive surgery. • Use of feeding tubes can lead to peritonitis. • Peritonitis can happen after a procedure to take out fluid from your abdomen, such as for the condition ascites in liver disease. • In rare cases, it can be a complication of an exam to check inside the rectum and colon called colonoscopy. • Peritonitis can happen after a procedure to check the digestive tract called endoscopy. • This is also rare. • A ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer or hole in the colon. • Any of these conditions can allow bacteria to get into the peritoneum through a hole in your digestive tract. • Pancreatitis. • This is inflammation of a gland in the abdomen called the pancreas. • If you have pancreatitis and you get an infection, bacteria could spread outside the pancreas. • That may lead to peritonitis. • Diverticulitis. • Infection of small, bulging pouches in the digestive tract may cause peritonitis. • This could happen if one of the pouches breaks open. • The burst pouch could spill waste from the intestine into the abdomen. • Trauma. • Injury may cause peritonitis. • This could allow bacteria or chemicals from other parts of the body to get into your peritoneum. • Peritonitis that happens without a hole or tear is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. • It's usually a complication of liver disease, such as cirrhosis. • Advanced cirrhosis causes a lot of fluid buildup in your abdomen. • That fluid buildup could lead to a bacterial infection. • Some things that raise the risk of peritonitis are: Peritoneal dialysis. • Peritonitis can happen in people who get this treatment. • Other medical conditions. • Certain conditions raise your risk of getting peritonitis, such as: Liver cirrhosis. • Appendicitis. • Stomach ulcers. • Diverticulitis. • Crohn's disease. • Pancreatitis. • History of peritonitis. • Once you've had peritonitis, your risk of getting it again may be higher than that of someone who's never had it. • Without treatment, peritonitis may cause a whole-body infection called sepsis. • Sepsis is very dangerous. • It can cause shock, organ failure and death. • Peritonitis that's linked with peritoneal dialysis is often caused by germs around the catheter. • If you use peritoneal dialysis, take these steps to prevent peritonitis: Wash your hands before you touch the catheter. • Scrub under your fingernails and between your fingers. • Clean the skin around the catheter with an antiseptic every day. • Store your supplies in a clean place. • Wear a surgical mask during your dialysis fluid exchanges. • Talk with your dialysis care team about the correct care for your peritoneal dialysis catheter. • Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics to prevent peritonitis, especially if you've had peritonitis before. • Antibiotics also might be prescribed if you have a buildup of peritoneal fluid due to a medical condition such as liver cirrhosis. • If you take medicine called a proton pump inhibitor, you may be asked to stop taking it.",

      "Overview": "Persistent depressive disorder is a continuous, long-term form of depression. • You may feel sad and empty, lose interest in daily activities and have trouble getting things done. • You may also have low self-esteem, feel like a failure and feel hopeless. • These feelings last for years and may interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities. • If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions. • You may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or not able to have fun. • Persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, but your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe. • Because persistent depressive disorder is long term, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging. • A combination of talk therapy and medicine can be effective in treating this condition.",
      "Symptoms": "Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years. • The intensity of symptoms can change over time. • But symptoms usually don't disappear for more than two months at a time. • Also, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder. • Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause major problems in your life and may include: Sadness, emptiness or feeling down. • Loss of interest in daily activities. • Tiredness and lack of energy. • Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling you're not capable. • Trouble focusing clearly and trouble making decisions. • Problems getting things done well and on time. • Quickly becoming annoyed, impatient or angry. • Avoidance of social activities. • Feelings of guilt and worries over the past. • Poor appetite or overeating. • Sleep problems. • Hopelessness. • In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and being irritable, which means easily becoming annoyed, impatient or angry. • If these feelings have been going on for a long time, you may think they'll always be part of your life. • But if you have any symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, seek medical help. • Talk to your health care provider about your symptoms or seek help from a mental health professional. • Or you can reach out to someone else who may be able to help guide you to treatment. • This could be a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or another person you trust. • If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number immediately. • Or contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 888-628-9454 (toll-free). • The exact cause of persistent depressive disorder is not known. • As with major depression, it may involve more than one cause, such as: Biological differences. • People with persistent depressive disorder may have physical changes in their brains. • It's not clear how these changes affect the disorder, but they may eventually help determine the causes. • Brain chemistry. • Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals. • Research indicates that changes in neurotransmitters may play a large part in depression and its treatment. • Inherited traits. • Persistent depressive disorder appears to be more common in people whose blood relatives also have the condition. • Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression. • Life events. • As with major depression, traumatic events such as the loss of a loved one, financial problems or a high level of stress can trigger persistent depressive disorder in some people. • Persistent depressive disorder often begins early — in childhood, the teen years or young adult life — and continues for a long time. • Certain factors appear to increase the risk of developing persistent depressive disorder, including: Having a first-degree blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with major depressive disorder or other depressive disorders. • Traumatic or stressful life events, such as the loss of a loved one or major financial problems. • Personality traits that include negativity, such as low self-esteem, being too dependent or self-critical, or always thinking the worst will happen. • History of other mental health disorders, such as a personality disorder. • Conditions that may be linked with persistent depressive disorder include: Lower quality of life. • Major depression, anxiety disorders and other mood disorders. • Substance misuse. • Relationship difficulties and family conflicts. • School or work problems and trouble getting things done. • Continuing pain and general medical illnesses. • Suicidal thoughts or behavior. • Personality disorders or other mental health disorders. • There's no sure way to prevent persistent depressive disorder. • Because it often starts in childhood or during the teenage years, identifying children at risk of the condition may help them get early treatment. • Strategies that may help reduce or prevent symptoms include the following: Take steps to control stress, to increase your ability to recover from problems — which is called resilience — and to boost your self-esteem. • Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you get through rough spells. • Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent symptoms from worsening. • Consider getting long-term treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.",

      "Overview": "Peyronie (pay-roe-NEE) disease is a condition in which fibrous scar tissue forms in the deeper tissues under the skin of the penis. • This causes curved, painful erections. • It also can make the penis shorter while erect. • Peyronie disease is not caused by cancer. • Penises vary in shape and size. • So having a curved erection isn't always a cause for concern. • But Peyronie disease causes a serious bend or pain in some people. • This can prevent you from having sex. • Or it might make it hard to get or keep an erection, which also is called erectile dysfunction. • For many people, Peyronie disease also causes stress and anxiety. • Peyronie disease rarely goes away on its own. • In most people with the condition, it will remain as is or may get slightly worse early on. • Early treatment soon after you get the condition may keep it from getting worse or even improve symptoms. • Even if you've had Peyronie disease for some time, treatment may help ease symptoms such as pain, curving and shortening.",
      "Symptoms": "Peyronie disease symptoms might start suddenly or appear over time. • The most common symptoms include: Scar tissue. • The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. • It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. • It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. • The area over the scar tissue may feel tender. • A bend to the penis. • The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side. • Erection problems. • Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. • This also is called erectile dysfunction. • Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms. • Shortening of the penis. • The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease. • Pain in the penis. • This symptom might happen with or without an erection. • Other changes in how the penis looks. • In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. • It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft. • The curving and penile shortening linked with Peyronie disease might become worse over time. • Physical changes in the penis often get worse or stay the same during the first year to year and a half. • Pain during erections usually gets better within 1 to 2 years. • The scar tissue, penile shortening and curving often remain. • It's not common, but the curving and pain of Peyronie disease can get better without treatment. • See a health care professional if you notice symptoms of Peyronie disease. • Early treatment gives you the best chance to improve the condition or keep it from getting worse. • If you've had the condition for some time, get a health care checkup if the pain, curving, length, or other changes bother you or your partner. • The exact cause of Peyronie disease isn't clear. • But various factors seem to be involved. • It's thought Peyronie disease most often results from repeated injury to the penis during vigorous sex. • But the penis also could be damaged during athletic activities or accidents. • Many people with Peyronie disease can't recall a specific injury that led to their symptoms. • During the healing process after injury to the penis, scar tissue forms. • This can lead to a lump you can feel or to a curve in the penis. • Each side of the penis contains a spongelike tube called a corpus cavernosum. • These tubes have many tiny blood vessels. • Each of the corpora cavernosa is encased in a sheath of elastic tissue called the tunica albuginea (TOO-nih-kuh al-BYOO-JIN-e-uh). • The sheath stretches during an erection. • When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers. • As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection. • In Peyronie disease, when the penis becomes erect, the area with the scar tissue doesn't stretch. • As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes. • This can be painful. • In most people, Peyronie disease symptoms come on slowly and don't seem to be linked with an injury. • Researchers are looking into whether Peyronie disease might be tied to a genetic trait or certain health conditions. • Minor injury to the penis doesn't always lead to Peyronie disease. • Various factors can contribute to poor wound healing and scar tissue buildup that might play a role in Peyronie disease. • These include: Family history. • If a family member has Peyronie disease, you have a higher risk of the condition. • Connective tissue diseases. • People who have certain conditions that affect connective tissue in the body seem to have a higher risk of getting Peyronie disease. • For example, some people with Peyronie disease also have a thick cord under the skin of the palm that can pull the fingers inward. • This is called Dupuytren contracture. • Age. • Peyronie disease can happen at any age. • But it becomes more common between the ages of 45 and 70. • Curving of the penis in younger men less often is due to Peyronie disease. • It is more commonly called congenital penile curvature. • A small amount of curvature in younger men is typical and not concerning. • Other factors might be linked to Peyronie disease. • These include certain health conditions, smoking and some types of prostate surgery. • Peyronie disease might lead to troubles that include: Not being able to have sex. • Trouble getting or keeping an erection, also called erectile dysfunction. • Anxiety, stress, or depression over challenges having sex or the way your penis looks. • Stress on your relationship with your sexual partner. • Trouble having a child because it's challenging or not possible to have sex. • Shorter penis length. • Penile pain.",

      "Overview": "Phenylketonuria (fen-ul-key-toe-NU-ree-uh), also called PKU, is a rare inherited disorder that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body. • PKU is caused by a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. • This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. • Without the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine, a dangerous buildup can develop when a person with PKU eats foods that contain protein or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. • This can eventually lead to serious health problems. • For the rest of their lives, people with PKU — babies, children and adults — need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. • Newer medications may allow some people with PKU to eat a diet that has a higher or an unrestricted amount of phenylalanine. • Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened for PKU soon after birth. • Although there is no cure for PKU, recognizing PKU and starting treatment right away can help prevent limitations in areas of thinking, understanding and communicating (intellectual disability) and major health problems.",
      "Symptoms": "Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms. • However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months. • Signs and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include: A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures Skin rashes, such as eczema Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Unusually small head size (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral, emotional and social problems Mental health disorders The severity of PKU depends on the type. • Classic PKU. • The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. • The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. • This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. • Less severe forms of PKU. • In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. • Regardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. • Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. • If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby. • Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. • Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU. • But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. • At birth, the baby may have: Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior. • Talk to your health care provider in these situations: Newborns. • If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have PKU, your child's health care provider will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems. • Women of childbearing years. • It's especially important for women with a history of PKU to see a health care provider and maintain the PKU diet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy. • This reduces the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies. • Adults. • People with PKU need to receive lifelong care. • Adults with PKU who have stopped the PKU diet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their health care providers. • Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and prevent further damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels. • A gene change (genetic mutation) causes PKU, which can be mild, moderate or severe. • In a person with PKU, a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene causes a lack of or reduced amount of the enzyme that's needed to process phenylalanine, an amino acid. • A dangerous buildup of phenylalanine can develop when a person with PKU eats protein-rich foods, such as milk, cheese, nuts or meat, or grains such as bread and pasta, or aspartame, an artificial sweetener. • For a child to inherit PKU, both the mother and father must have and pass on the changed gene. • This pattern of inheritance is called autosomal recessive. • It's possible for a parent to be a carrier — to have the changed gene that causes PKU, but not have the disease. • If only one parent has the changed gene, there's no risk of passing PKU to a child, but it's possible for the child to be a carrier. • Most often, PKU is passed to children by two parents who are both carriers of the changed gene, but don't know it. • Risk factors for inheriting PKU include: Having both parents with a gene change that causes PKU. • Two parents must pass along a copy of the changed gene for their child to develop the condition. • Being of a certain racial or ethnic descent. • PKU affects people from most ethnic backgrounds worldwide. • But in the United States, it's most common in people of European ancestry and much less common in people of African ancestry. • Untreated PKU can lead to complications in infants, children and adults with the disorder. • When women with PKU have high blood phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, it can harm their unborn baby. • Untreated PKU can lead to: Irreversible brain damage and marked intellectual disability beginning within the first few months of life Neurological problems such as seizures and tremors Behavioral, emotional and social problems in older children and adults Major health and developmental problems If you have PKU and are considering getting pregnant: Follow a low-phenylalanine diet. • Women with PKU can prevent harm to their developing baby by sticking to or returning to a low-phenylalanine diet before becoming pregnant. • Nutritional supplements designed for people with PKU can ensure enough protein and nutrition during pregnancy. • If you have PKU, talk to your health care provider before you start trying to conceive. • Consider genetic counseling. • If you have PKU, a close relative with PKU or a child with PKU, you may benefit from genetic counseling before becoming pregnant. • A specialist in medical genetics (geneticist) can help you better understand how PKU is passed through your family. • The specialist can also help determine your risk of having a child with PKU and assist with family planning.",

      "Overview": "A pheochromocytoma (fee-o-kroe-moe-sy-TOE-muh) is a rare tumor that grows in an adrenal gland. • Most often, the tumor is not cancer. • When a tumor isn't cancer, it's called benign. • You have two adrenal glands — one at the top of each kidney. • The adrenal glands make hormones that help control key processes in the body, such as blood pressure. • Usually, a pheochromocytoma forms in only one adrenal gland. • But tumors can grow in both adrenal glands. • With a pheochromocytoma, the tumor releases hormones that can cause various symptoms. • They include high blood pressure, headache, sweating and symptoms of a panic attack. • If a pheochromocytoma isn't treated, serious or life-threatening damage to other body systems can happen. • Surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma often returns blood pressure to a healthy range.",
      "Symptoms": "A pheochromocytoma often causes the following symptoms: High blood pressure. • Headache. • Heavy sweating. • Rapid heartbeat. • Some people with pheochromocytomas also have symptoms such as: Nervous shaking. • Skin that turns a lighter color, also called pallor. • Shortness of breath. • Panic attack-type symptoms, which can include sudden intense fear. • Anxiety or a sense of doom. • Vision problems. • Constipation. • Weight loss. • Some people with pheochromocytomas have no symptoms. • They don't realize they have the tumor until an imaging test happens to find it. • Most often, the symptoms of pheochromocytoma come and go. • When they start suddenly and keep coming back, they're known as spells or attacks. • These spells may or may not have a trigger that can be found. • Certain activities or conditions can lead to a spell, such as: Physical hard work. • Anxiety or stress. • Changes in body position, such as bending over, or going from sitting or lying down to standing. • Labor and delivery. • Surgery and a medicine that causes you to be in a sleep-like state during surgery, called an anesthetic. • Foods high in tyramine, a substance that affects blood pressure, also can trigger spells. • Tyramine is common in foods that are fermented, aged, pickled, cured, overripe or spoiled. • These foods include: Some cheeses. • Some beers and wines. • Soybeans or products made with soy. • Chocolate. • Dried or smoked meats. • Certain medicines and drugs that can trigger spells include: Depression medicines called tricyclic antidepressants. • Some examples of tricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline and desipramine (Norpramin). • Depression medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) and isocarboxazid (Marplan). • The risk of spells is even higher if these medicines are taken with foods or drinks high in tyramine. • Stimulants such as caffeine, amphetamines or cocaine. • High blood pressure is one of the main symptoms of a pheochromocytoma. • But most people who have high blood pressure don't have an adrenal tumor. • Talk to your healthcare professional if any of these factors apply to you: Spells of symptoms linked with pheochromocytoma, such as headaches, sweating and a fast, pounding heartbeat. • Trouble controlling high blood pressure with your current treatment. • High blood pressure that starts before the age of 20. • Recurring large rises in blood pressure. • A family history of pheochromocytoma. • A family history of a related genetic condition. • These include multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN 2), von Hippel-Lindau disease, inherited paraganglioma syndromes and neurofibromatosis 1.",
      "Causes": "Researchers don't know exactly what causes a pheochromocytoma. • The tumor forms in cells called chromaffin cells. • These cells are located in the center of an adrenal gland. • They release certain hormones, mainly adrenaline and noradrenaline. • These hormones help control many body functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar. • Adrenaline and noradrenaline trigger the body's fight-or-flight response. • That response happens when the body thinks there is a threat. • The hormones cause blood pressure to rise and the heart to beat faster. • They also prepare other body systems so you can react quickly. • A pheochromocytoma causes more of these hormones to be released. • And it causes them to be released when you're not in a threatening situation. • Most of the chromaffin cells are in the adrenal glands. • But small clusters of these cells also are in the heart, head, neck, bladder, stomach area and along the spine. • Chromaffin cell tumors located outside of the adrenal glands are called paragangliomas. • They may cause the same effects on the body as a pheochromocytoma.",
      "Risk factors": "A person's age and certain medical conditions can raise the risk of a pheochromocytoma. • Most pheochromocytomas are found in people between the ages of 20 and 50. • But the tumor can form at any age. • People who have certain rare genetic conditions have a higher risk of pheochromocytomas. • The tumors can be benign, meaning they are not cancer. • Or they can be malignant, meaning they are cancer. • Often, benign tumors related to these genetic conditions form in both adrenal glands. • Genetic conditions linked with pheochromocytoma include: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2 (MEN 2). • This condition can cause tumors in more than one part of the body's hormone-making system, called the endocrine system. • There are two types of MEN 2 — type 2A and type 2B. • Both can involve pheochromocytomas. • Other tumors linked with this condition can appear in other parts of the body. • These body parts include the thyroid, parathyroid glands, lips, mouth and digestive system. • Von Hippel-Lindau disease. • This condition can cause tumors in many parts of the body. • Possible sites include the brain and spinal cord, endocrine system, pancreas and kidneys. • Neurofibromatosis 1. • This condition causes tumors in the skin called neurofibromas. • It also can cause tumors of the nerve at the back of the eye that connects to the brain, called the optic nerve. • Hereditary paraganglioma syndromes. • These conditions are passed down in families. • They can result in pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.",
      "Complications": "A pheochromocytoma can lead to other health problems. • The high blood pressure linked with a pheochromocytoma can damage organs, especially tissues of the heart and blood vessel system, brain and kidneys. • This damage can cause dangerous conditions, including: Heart disease. • Stroke. • Kidney failure. • Vision loss. • Rarely, a pheochromocytoma is cancerous, and the cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. • Cancer cells from a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma most often travel to the lymph system, bones, liver or lungs."

      "Overview": "A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues, such as bones, cartilage, muscles or tendons. • This pressure can cause pain, tingling, numbness or weakness. • A pinched nerve can occur in many areas of the body. • For example, a herniated disk in the lower spine may put pressure on a nerve root. • This may cause pain that radiates down the back of the leg. • A pinched nerve in the wrist can lead to pain and numbness in the hand and fingers, known as carpal tunnel syndrome. • With rest and other conservative treatments, most people recover from a pinched nerve within a few days or weeks. • Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve pain from a pinched nerve.",
      "Symptoms": "Pinched nerve symptoms include: Numbness or less feeling in the area supplied by the nerve. • Sharp, aching or burning pain, which may radiate outward. • Tingling, or a pins and needles feeling. • Muscle weakness in the affected area. • Often feeling as if a foot or hand has \"fallen asleep.\" Symptoms related to a pinched nerve may be worse when you're sleeping. • Self-care measures such as rest and pain relievers available without a prescription may resolve the symptoms of a pinched nerve. • See your healthcare professional if symptoms last for several days and don't respond to self-care. • A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure, known as compression, is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues. • This tissue might be bone or cartilage, such as when a herniated spinal disk compresses a nerve root. • Or muscle or tendons may compress a nerve. • In carpal tunnel syndrome, a variety of tissues may be responsible for compression of the carpal tunnel's median nerve in the wrist. • It can be caused by swollen tendon sheaths within the tunnel, enlarged bone that narrows the tunnel, or a thickened and degenerated ligament. • A number of conditions may cause tissue to compress a nerve or nerves, including: Injury. • Rheumatoid or wrist arthritis. • Stress from repetitive work. • Hobbies or sports. • Obesity. • If a nerve is pinched for only a short time, there's often no permanent damage. • Once the pressure is relieved, nerve function returns. • However, if the pressure continues, chronic pain and permanent nerve damage can occur. • The following factors may increase your risk of experiencing a pinched nerve: Sex assigned at birth. • Women are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly due to having smaller carpal tunnels. • Bone spurs. • Trauma or a condition that causes bone thickening, such as osteoarthritis, can cause bone spurs. • Bone spurs can stiffen the spine as well as narrow the space where your nerves travel, pinching nerves. • Rheumatoid arthritis. • Inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis can compress nerves, especially in your joints. • Thyroid disease. • People with thyroid disease are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. • Other risk factors include: Diabetes. • People with diabetes are at higher risk of nerve compression. • Overuse. • Jobs or hobbies that require repetitive hand, wrist or shoulder movements increase the risk of a pinched nerve. • This includes assembly line work. • Obesity. • Excess weight can add pressure to nerves. • Pregnancy. • Water and weight gain associated with pregnancy can swell nerve pathways, compressing your nerves. • Prolonged bed rest. • Long periods of lying down can increase the risk of nerve compression. • The following measures may help you prevent a pinched nerve: Maintain good positioning. • Don't cross your legs or lie in any one position for a long time. • Incorporate strength and flexibility exercises into your regular exercise program. • Limit repetitive activities and take frequent breaks when engaging in these activities. • Maintain a healthy weight to put less pressure on nerves.",

      "Overview": "Pineoblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the brain's pineal gland. • The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. • The gland makes a hormone called melatonin. • Melatonin plays a role in the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. • Pineoblastoma begins as a growth of cells in the pineal gland. • The cells grow quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • Pineoblastoma can occur at any age. • But it happens most often in young children. • Pineoblastoma may cause headaches, sleepiness and changes in the way the eyes move. • Pineoblastoma can be very difficult to treat. • It can spread within the brain and into the fluid around the brain. • This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. • Pineoblastoma almost never spreads beyond the central nervous system. • Treatment usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. • Additional treatments also may be recommended.",
      "Symptoms": "Pineoblastoma signs and symptoms include: Behavior changes. • Headaches. • Lack of energy. • Nausea. • Problems with memory and thinking. • Pineoblastoma sometimes causes eye symptoms. • This can happen when the cancer causes pressure on parts of the brain that help with vision. • The eye symptoms that pineoblastoma causes are sometimes called Parinaud syndrome. • Eye symptoms caused by pineoblastoma include: Blurred vision. • Double vision. • Problems focusing on objects that are up close. • Problems looking upward. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you or your child have symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "The cause of pineoblastoma often isn't known. • This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the pineal gland. • The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. • Pineoblastoma happens when cells in the pineal gland develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells form a growth in the pineal gland. • The growth, called a tumor, may press on nearby parts of the brain as it gets bigger. • The tumor also may block the flow of fluid in the brain. • This causes pressure that builds up inside the brain.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for pineoblastoma include: Young age. • Pineoblastoma is most common in children ages 1 to 12 years old. • Inherited eye cancer. • A genetic disorder called hereditary retinoblastoma raises the risk of pineoblastoma. • Hereditary retinoblastoma runs in families. • It increases the risk of a type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma and other kinds of cancer. • There is no way to prevent pineoblastoma."

      "Overview": "Pink eye is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eyelid and eyeball. • This membrane is called the conjunctiva. • When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become swollen and irritated, they're more visible. • This is what causes the whites of the eyes to appear reddish or pink. • Pink eye also is called conjunctivitis. • Pink eye is most often caused by a viral infection. • It also can be caused by a bacterial infection, an allergic reaction or — in babies — an incompletely opened tear duct. • Though pink eye can be irritating, it rarely affects your vision. • Treatments can help ease the discomfort of pink eye. • Because pink eye can be contagious, getting an early diagnosis and taking certain precautions can help limit its spread.",
      "Symptoms": "The most common pink eye symptoms include: Redness in one or both eyes. • Itchiness in one or both eyes. • A gritty feeling in one or both eyes. • A discharge in one or both eyes that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning. • Tearing. • Sensitivity to light, called photophobia. • There are serious eye conditions that can cause eye redness. • These conditions may cause eye pain, a feeling that something is stuck in your eye, blurred vision and light sensitivity. • If you experience these symptoms, seek urgent care. • People who wear contact lenses need to stop wearing their contacts as soon as pink eye symptoms begin. • If your symptoms don't start to get better within 12 to 24 hours, make an appointment with your eye healthcare professional to make sure you don't have a more serious eye infection related to contact lens use. • Causes of pink eye include: Viruses. • Bacteria. • Allergies. • A chemical splash in the eye. • A foreign object in the eye. • In newborns, a blocked tear duct. • Most cases of pink eye are caused by adenovirus. • It also can be caused by other viruses, including herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus. • Both viral and bacterial conjunctivitis can occur along with colds or symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a sore throat. • Wearing contact lenses that aren't cleaned properly or aren't your own can cause bacterial conjunctivitis. • Both types are very contagious. • They are spread through direct or indirect contact with the liquid that drains from the eye of someone who's infected. • One or both eyes may be affected. • Allergic conjunctivitis affects both eyes. • It is a response to an allergy-causing substance such as pollen. • In response to allergens, your body produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). • IgE triggers special cells in the mucous lining of your eyes and airways to release inflammatory substances, including histamines. • Your body's release of histamine can produce a number of allergy symptoms, including red or pink eyes. • If you have allergic conjunctivitis, you may experience intense itching, tearing and inflammation of the eyes. • You also could have sneezing and watery nasal discharge. • Most allergic conjunctivitis can be controlled with allergy eye drops. • Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious. • Irritation from a chemical splash or foreign object in the eye also is associated with conjunctivitis. • Sometimes flushing and cleaning the eye to wash out the chemical or object causes redness and irritation. • Symptoms, which may include watery eyes and a mucous discharge, usually clear up on their own within about a day. • If flushing doesn't resolve the symptoms, or if the chemical is a caustic one such as lye, see your healthcare professional or eye specialist as soon as possible. • A chemical splash into the eye can cause permanent eye damage. • Ongoing symptoms could indicate that you still have the foreign body in your eye. • Or you also could have a scratch on the cornea or the membrane covering the eyeball, called the conjunctiva. • Risk factors for pink eye include: Exposure to someone infected with the viral or bacterial form of conjunctivitis. • Exposure to something you're allergic to, for allergic conjunctivitis. • Using contact lenses, especially extended-wear lenses. • In both children and adults, pink eye can cause inflammation in the cornea that can affect vision. • Prompt evaluation and treatment by your healthcare professional can reduce the risk of complications. • See your professional if you have: Eye pain. • A feeling that something is stuck in the eye. • Blurred vision. • Light sensitivity. • Practice good hygiene to control the spread of pink eye. • For instance: Don't touch your eyes with your hands. • Wash your hands often. • Use a clean towel and washcloth daily. • Don't share towels or washcloths. • Change your pillowcases often. • Throw away old eye cosmetics, such as mascara. • Don't share eye cosmetics or personal eye care items. • Keep in mind that pink eye is no more contagious than the common cold. • It's okay to return to work, school or child care if you're able to practice good hygiene and avoid close contact. • However, if work, school or child care involves close contact with others, it may be best to stay home until your or your child's symptoms clear up. • Newborns' eyes are susceptible to bacteria present in the mother's birth canal. • These bacteria often cause no symptoms in the mother. • In some cases, these bacteria can cause infants to develop a serious form of conjunctivitis known as ophthalmia neonatorum. • This condition needs immediate treatment to keep the baby's sight. • That's why shortly after birth, an antibiotic ointment is applied to every newborn's eyes. • The ointment helps prevent eye infection.",

      "Overview": "Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary gland. • This gland is an organ about the size of a pea. • It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain. • Some of these tumors cause the pituitary gland to make too much of certain hormones that control important body functions. • Others can cause the pituitary gland to make too little of those hormones. • Most pituitary tumors are benign. • That means they are not cancer. • Another name for these noncancerous tumors is pituitary adenomas. • Most adenomas stay in the pituitary gland or in the tissue around it, and they grow slowly. • They typically don't spread to other parts of the body. • Pituitary tumors can be treated in several ways. • The tumor may be removed with surgery. • Or its growth may be controlled with medications or radiation therapy. • Sometimes, hormone levels are managed with medicine. • Your health care provider may suggest a combination of these treatments. • In some cases, observation — also called a ''wait-and-see'' approach — may be the right choice. • Types of pituitary adenomas include: Functioning. • These adenomas make hormones. • They cause different symptoms depending on the kind of hormones they make. • Functioning pituitary adenomas fall into several categories, including those that make: Adrenocorticotropic hormone. • This hormone also is known as ACTH. • These tumors are sometimes called corticotroph adenomas. • Growth hormone. • These tumors are called somatotroph adenomas. • Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. • These hormones also are known as gonadotropins. • Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas. • Prolactin. • These tumors are called prolactinomas or lactotroph adenomas. • Thyroid-stimulating hormone. • These tumors are called thyrotroph adenomas. • Nonfunctioning. • These adenomas don't make hormones. • The symptoms they cause are related to the pressure their growth puts on the pituitary gland, nearby nerves and the brain. • Macroadenomas. • These are larger adenomas. • They measure about 1 centimeter or more. • That's slightly less than a half-inch. • They can be functioning or nonfunctioning. • Microadenomas. • These adenomas are smaller. • They measure less than 1 centimeter. • That's slightly less than a half-inch. • They can be functioning or nonfunctioning. • Pituitary tumors are different from pituitary cysts. • A cyst is a sac that may be filled with air, fluid or other material. • A tumor is an unusual mass of cells that may grow over time. • Cysts may form on or near the pituitary gland, but they are not tumors or adenomas.",
      "Symptoms": "Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. • Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. • If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment. • Pituitary tumor symptoms may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other parts of the body nearby. • Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. • Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. • Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall. • Macroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other parts of the body nearby. • That can cause symptoms such as: Headache. • Eye problems due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision. • Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain. • Drooping eyelid. • Seizures. • Nausea and vomiting. • Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. • When that happens, symptoms may include: Tiredness or weakness. • Lack of energy. • Sexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex. • Changes in menstrual cycles. • Nausea. • Feeling cold. • Losing or gaining weight without trying. • Functioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone. • That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone. • Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. • The following types of functioning pituitary adenomas cause different symptoms depending on the hormones they make. • Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. • Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. • ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. • This causes a condition called Cushing disease. • Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. • Cushing disease symptoms include: Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back. • Rounded face. • Stretch marks. • Thin skin that bruises easily. • Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness. • Thicker or more visible body hair. • Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections. • Areas of darkened skin. • Acne. • Changes in menstrual cycles. • Sexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex. • Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas. • Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly. • Acromegaly can cause: Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide spaces between teeth. • Growth of hands and feet. • Thicker skin. • More sweating and body odor. • Joint pain. • A deeper voice. • Children and teens who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. • This condition is called gigantism. • Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known as gonadotropins. • Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas. • It's uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms. • Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure. • If symptoms do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect women and men differently. • Symptoms in women may include: Change in menstrual cycles. • Fertility problems. • Enlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. • Symptoms in men may include: Enlarged testicles. • Higher levels of testosterone. • These adenomas are called prolactinomas. • Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's levels of sex hormones — estrogen and testosterone. • Too much prolactin affects men and women differently. • In women, too much prolactin might cause: Irregular menstrual cycles. • Lack of menstrual cycles. • Milky discharge from the breasts. • Breast tenderness. • Problems with fertility. • Less interest in sex. • In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. • Symptoms might include: Problems with erections. • Less interest in sex. • Breast growth. • Problems with fertility. • Less body and facial hair. • Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. • They also may be referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. • They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. • That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease. • Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. • Some of the most common include: Weight loss. • Rapid or irregular heartbeat. • Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. • Frequent bowel movements. • Sweating. • Tremor. • Sleep problems. • If you develop symptoms that might be associated with a pituitary tumor, see your health care provider. • Treatment for pituitary tumors often can bring hormones back to a healthy level and ease symptoms. • Although rare, some pituitary tumors are hereditary. • That means they run in families. • In particular, the hereditary disorder multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can cause pituitary tumors. • If MEN 1 runs in your family, talk to your health care provider about tests that may help find a pituitary tumor early. • The pituitary gland is a small organ about the size of a pea. • It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain. • Despite its small size, the pituitary gland has an effect on nearly every part of the body. • The hormones it makes control important body functions, such as growth, blood pressure and reproduction. • The cause of uncontrolled cell growth in the pituitary gland, which creates a tumor, remains unknown. • In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be caused by genes you've inherited. • But most have no clear hereditary cause. • Still, scientists think that changes in genes may play an important role in how pituitary tumors develop. • Most people who get pituitary tumors don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing these tumors. • Environment and lifestyle choices don't seem to have an effect on a person's risk of pituitary tumors. • Although genetics seems to play a role, most people who have pituitary tumors don't have a family history of them. • The only known risk factors are several rare hereditary conditions that raise the risk of many health problems, including pituitary tumors. • These conditions include: Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, also called MEN 1. • Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 4, also called MEN 4. • Carney complex. • McCune-Albright syndrome. • Pituitary tumors usually don't spread to other parts of the body. • They can affect a person's health, though. • Pituitary tumors may cause: Problems with eyesight, including vision loss. • High blood pressure. • High blood sugar. • Bone loss. • Heart problems. • Problems with thinking and memory. • If a pituitary tumor presses on part of the brain called the medial temporal lobe, it may lead to a seizure. • This type of seizure is known as a focal seizure with impaired awareness. • These seizures involve a change in or loss of consciousness or awareness. • If you have one of these seizures, you may seem to be awake. • But you stare into space and don't respond as you typically would to the environment around you. • You may not remember the seizure after it happens. • Having a pituitary tumor or having one removed with surgery may permanently change your body's hormone supply. • As a result, you may need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. • A rare but potentially serious complication of a pituitary tumor is pituitary apoplexy. • This happens when there is sudden bleeding into the tumor. • Symptoms include: A severe headache, likely worse than you've ever had before. • Problems with your eyesight, including double vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes. • Nausea and vomiting. • Confusion or other reduced mental function. • Pituitary apoplexy requires emergency treatment. • The treatment usually includes taking corticosteroid medicine to ease swelling around the tumor. • You also may need surgery to remove the tumor.",

      "Overview": "Plague is a serious illness caused by a germ called Yersinia pestis. • The germs mostly live in small rodents and their fleas. • The most common way for humans to get plague is a flea bite. • Plague is a rare disease. • The illness mostly occurs in only a few countries around the world. • In the United States, plague affects a few people each year in rural or semirural areas of western states. • Plague usually can be treated with antibiotics. • If not treated, the illness is often deadly. • Plague is considered a potential bioweapon. • The U.S. government has plans and treatments in place if the disease is used as a weapon.",
      "Symptoms": "There are three types of plague. • The symptoms vary for each type. • Bubonic plague causes swelling of lymph nodes. • These are small, bean-shaped filters in the body's immune system. • A swollen lymph node is called a bubo. • The word \"bubonic\" is describing this feature of the disease. • If a person has bubonic plague, buboes appear in the armpits, groin or neck. • Buboes are tender or painful. • They vary in size from about less than half an inch (1 centimeter) to about 4 inches (10 centimeters). • Other symptoms of bubonic plague may include: Sudden high fever and chills. • Headache. • Tiredness. • Not feeling well in general. • Weakness. • Muscle aches. • Rarely, skin sores. • Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream. • Buboes may not be present. • Early symptoms are very general and include: Sudden high fever and chills. • Extreme weakness. • Stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. • More-serious symptoms may develop with advanced disease and organ failure. • These include: Bleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin. • Signs of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure. • Blackening and death of tissue, called gangrene, most commonly on the fingers, toes, ears and nose. • Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. • The disease may begin in the lungs, or it may spread from infected lymph nodes to the lungs. • Symptoms can begin within a few hours after exposure and worsen rapidly. • Symptoms may include: Sudden high fever and chills. • Cough, with bloody mucus. • Difficulty or irregular breathing. • Chest pain. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Headache. • Weakness. • If treatment is not begun the first day, the disease progresses rapidly to failure of the lungs, shock and death. • Get immediate care if you have a sudden high fever. • Get emergency care if you have a sudden high fever or other symptoms and you live in an area that has had cases of plague. • In the western United States, most cases have been in Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. • Cases have occurred in Africa, Asia and Latin America. • The countries with frequent cases include Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru.",
      "Causes": "Plague is caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis. • The bacteria circulate in populations of small animals and their fleas. • In the western United States, these animals include: Rats, mice and voles. • Squirrels. • Rabbits. • Prairie dogs. • Ground squirrels and chipmunks. • Other animals can get plague by eating small animals with the disease or picking up their fleas. • These may include: Pet cats and dogs. • Coyotes. • Wild cats. • People are most likely to get plague from a flea bite. • The fleas are likely to come from small wild animals or from pets. • People also can get plague from direct contact with tissues of a sick animal. • For example, a hunter can pick up the disease while skinning or handling an animal with the illness. • Pneumonic plague can be passed from animals to humans, or from humans to humans. • Tiny droplets in the air can carry the bacteria when a person or animal coughs or sneezes. • People can become infected when they inhale the droplets or touch coughed-up mucus.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of getting plague is very low. • Worldwide, only a few thousand people get plague each year. • In the United States, seven people on average get plague each year. • Plague has been reported in nearly all parts of the world. • The most common locations are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. • In Madagascar there is usually an outbreak of plague every year. • Plague has been reported in the western United States, most often in Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. • The disease mostly survives in populations of rodents and their fleas in rural and semirural areas. • It also has occurred in cities with overcrowding, poor sanitation or large rat populations. • People are at risk of getting plague if they work outdoors in areas where plague-carrying animals are common. • People who work in animal clinics in these regions also have a risk of coming into contact with pet cats and dogs with the disease. • Camping, hunting or hiking in areas where plague-carrying animals reside can increase the risk of being bitten by an infected flea. • The U.S. government considers plague a possible biological weapon. • Evidence exists of it being used or developed as a weapon in the past. • The U.S. government has guidelines for treatment and prevention of plague used as a weapon.",
      "Complications": "Complications of plague may include: Gangrene. • Blood clots can form in the tiny blood vessels of the fingers, toes, nose and ears. • This can cause the tissues to die. • The dead tissue needs to be removed. • Meningitis. • Rarely, plague may cause swelling and disease of the protective tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. • This condition is called meningitis. • Pharyngeal plague. • Rarely, the disease can be present in the tissues behind the nasal cavity and mouth, called the pharynx. • This is called pharyngeal plague. • The risk of death in people with all types of plague in the United States is around 11%. • Most people with bubonic plague survive with prompt diagnosis and treatment. • Death is more likely with septicemic plague because it is difficult to diagnose and worsens rapidly. • Treatment may unintentionally be delayed. • Pneumonic plague is severe and worsens rapidly. • Risk of death is high if treatment doesn't begin within 24 hours after symptoms start.",
      "Prevention": "No vaccine is available, but scientists are working to develop one. • Antibiotics can help prevent infection if you were likely exposed to plague. • People with pneumonic plague are isolated during treatment to prevent the spread of disease. • Health care workers must wear protective masks, gowns, gloves and eyewear when they treat someone with pneumonic plague. • If you live or spend time outdoors where plague occurs: Rodent-proof your home. • Remove nesting areas for rodents, such as piles of brush, rock, firewood and junk. • Don't leave pet food in areas that rodents can easily access. • If you become aware of rodents living in your home, take steps to remove them. • Protect your pets. • Use flea-control medicines for your pets. • Talk to your vet about the best options. • If your pet is sick, get prompt treatment. • Don't let pets sleep with you if they are outside in areas where plague occurs. • Protection from animals. • When handling dead animals, wear gloves to prevent contact between your skin and the animal. • Call your local health department if you have concerns about the removal of a dead animal. • Use insect repellent on skin and clothing. • When outdoors, use insect repellents registered with the U.S. • Environmental Protection Agency. • These include products that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-3,8-diol or 2-undecanone. • Do not use a spray directly on your face. • Do not use products with OLE or PMD on children under age 3. • Do not use insect repellent on a child under 2 months old."

      "Overview": "Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. • It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes, known as the plantar fascia. • Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that often occurs with your first steps in the morning. • As you get up and move, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or when you stand up after sitting. • The cause of plantar fasciitis is poorly understood. • It is more common in runners and in people who are overweight.",
      "Symptoms": "Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel. • The pain is usually the worst with the first few steps after awakening, although it also can be triggered by long periods of standing or when you get up from sitting. • The plantar fascia is a band of tissue, called fascia, that connects your heel bone to the base of your toes. • It supports the arch of the foot and absorbs shock when walking. • Tension and stress on the fascia can cause small tears. • Repeated stretching and tearing of the facia can irritate or inflame it, although the cause remains unclear in many cases of plantar fasciitis. • Even though plantar fasciitis can develop without an obvious cause, some factors can increase your risk of developing this condition. • They include: Age. • Plantar fasciitis is most common in people between the ages of 40 and 60. • Certain types of exercise. • Activities that place a lot of stress on your heel and attached tissue — such as long-distance running, ballet dancing and aerobic dance — can contribute to the onset of plantar fasciitis. • Foot mechanics. • Flat feet, a high arch or even an atypical pattern of walking can affect the way weight is distributed when you're standing and can put added stress on the plantar fascia. • Obesity. • Excess pounds put extra stress on your plantar fascia. • Occupations that keep you on your feet. • Factory workers, teachers and others who spend most of their work hours walking or standing on hard surfaces can be at increased risk of plantar fasciitis. • Ignoring plantar fasciitis can result in chronic heel pain that hinders your regular activities. • You're likely to change your walk to try to avoid plantar fasciitis pain, which might lead to foot, knee, hip or back problems.",

      "Overview": "Pleurisy (PLOOR-ih-see) is a condition in which the pleura — two large, thin layers of tissue that separate your lungs from your chest wall — becomes inflamed. • Also called pleuritis, pleurisy causes sharp chest pain (pleuritic pain) that worsens during breathing. • One pleural layer of tissue wraps around the outside of the lungs. • The other pleural layer lines the inner chest wall. • Between these two layers is a small space (pleural space) that's usually filled with a very small amount of liquid. • These layers act like two pieces of smooth satin gliding past each other, allowing your lungs to expand and contract when you breathe. • If you have pleurisy, these tissues swell and become inflamed. • As a result, the two layers of the pleural lining rub against each other like two pieces of sandpaper. • This causes pain when you breathe in and out. • The pleuritic pain lessens or stops when you hold your breath. • Treatment of pleurisy involves pain control and treating the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of pleurisy might include: Chest pain that worsens when you breathe, cough or sneeze. • Shortness of breath — often from trying to limit breathing in and out. • Cough — only in some cases. • Fever — only in some cases. • Pain caused by pleurisy might worsen with movement of your upper body and can spread to your shoulders or back. • Pleurisy can occur along with pleural effusion, atelectasis or empyema: Pleural effusion. • In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. • This is called pleural effusion. • When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and don't rub together. • Atelectasis. • A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure. • This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). • This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing. • Empyema. • The extra fluid in the pleural space can also become infected, resulting in a buildup of pus. • This is called an empyema. • Fever often occurs along with an empyema. • Call your healthcare provider or seek emergency care right away if you experience unexplained, intense chest pain during breathing. • You might have a problem with your lungs, heart or pleura or an underlying illness for which you need prompt medical care. • A variety of conditions can cause pleurisy. • Causes include: Viral infection, such as the flu (influenza). • Bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. • Fungal infection. • Autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. • Lung cancer near the pleural surface. • Pulmonary embolism. • Tuberculosis (TB). • Rib fracture or trauma. • Certain inherited diseases, such as sickle cell disease. • Certain medications and recreational drugs. • The risk of pleurisy increases if you get certain infections, such as the flu or pneumonia. • Some medical conditions, such as lupus, TB and sickle cell disease also can increase your risk. • And taking certain medicines or certain recreational drugs raise the risk of pleurisy.",

      "Overview": "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. • The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. • A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. • Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. • It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. • Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. • Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Chest pain when you breathe or cough Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older) Cough, which may produce phlegm Fatigue Fever, sweating and shaking chills Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems) Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Shortness of breath Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. • Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. • See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. • It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: Adults older than age 65 Children younger than age 2 with signs and symptoms People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition. • Many germs can cause pneumonia. • The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe. • Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. • But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good. • Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection. • Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. • It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. • It may be caused by: Bacteria. • The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. • This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. • It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia. • Bacteria-like organisms. • Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. • It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. • Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest. • Fungi. • This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. • The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location. • Viruses, including COVID-19. • Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. • Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. • Viral pneumonia is usually mild. • But in some cases it can become very serious. • Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe. • Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. • Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. • People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia. • Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. • Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics. • Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. • Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs. • Pneumonia can affect anyone. • But the two age groups at highest risk are: Children who are 2 years old or younger People who are age 65 or older Other risk factors include: Being hospitalized. • You're at greater risk of pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you're on a machine that helps you breathe (a ventilator). • Chronic disease. • You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease. • Smoking. • Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia. • Weakened or suppressed immune system. • People who have HIV/AIDS, who've had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk. • Even with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk groups, may experience complications, including: Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia). • Bacteria that enter the bloodstream from your lungs can spread the infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure. • Difficulty breathing. • If your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic underlying lung diseases, you may have trouble breathing in enough oxygen. • You may need to be hospitalized and use a breathing machine (ventilator) while your lung heals. • Fluid accumulation around the lungs (pleural effusion). • Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the thin space between layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity (pleura). • If the fluid becomes infected, you may need to have it drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery. • Lung abscess. • An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. • An abscess is usually treated with antibiotics. • Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a long needle or tube placed into the abscess is needed to remove the pus. • To help prevent pneumonia: Get vaccinated. • Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. • Talk with your doctor about getting these shots. • The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your doctor even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine. • Make sure children get vaccinated. • Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 and for children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. • Children who attend a group child care center should also get the vaccine. • Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months. • Practice good hygiene. • To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. • Don't smoke. • Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections. • Keep your immune system strong. • Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.",

      "Overview": "Pneumonitis (noo-moe-NIE-tis) is a general term that refers to swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, of lung tissue. • Lung infections such as pneumonia also can cause lung tissue to become inflamed. • But pneumonitis generally refers to inflamed lung tissue not caused by an infection. • Pneumonitis is a result of an extra strong defense response by the body's immune system to an irritating substance. • Common causes of pneumonitis include airborne irritants at a job, in the home or from hobbies. • Other causes include some cancer treatments and many different medicines. • Trouble breathing, and often a dry cough, are the most common symptoms of pneumonitis. • Treatment focuses on avoiding irritants and lessening the inflammation of lung tissue.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of pneumonitis may develop quickly or slowly and can worsen over time. • At times symptoms may suddenly get worse or better. • Also, symptoms vary greatly among people with the condition and include: Trouble breathing. • Dry cough that usually doesn't bring up any mucus. • Extreme tiredness. • Loss of appetite. • Fever. • Joint and muscle pain. • Headache. • Weight loss. • Talk to your doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice symptoms such as trouble catching your breath or an ongoing dry cough. • If you have trouble breathing, go to the emergency department at a hospital right away or, in the U.S., call 911.",
      "Causes": "Pneumonitis happens when an irritating substance causes inflammation in the tiny air sacs called alveoli in your lungs. • Inflamed lung tissue makes it hard for oxygen to pass through the alveoli into the bloodstream. • Many causes have been linked to pneumonitis. • But it's not clear why some people have a strong immune system response to certain substances that cause pneumonitis, while others do not. • For many people, the specific substance causing the inflammation is never identified. • Some types of pneumonitis include hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis and radiation-induced pneumonitis. • For some people, breathing in airborne particles triggers a strong allergic reaction by their immune system. • This reaction irritates the lungs, causing pneumonitis. • The condition also is called extrinsic allergic alveolitis. • Specific types of hypersensitivity pneumonitis have nicknames related to their cause, such as \"farmer's lung,\" \"bird-fancier's lung\" or \"hot tub lung.\" Causes can include: Molds. • Repeated exposure to molds can cause inflamed lung tissue. • Breathing in airborne bits from moldy hay is one of the most common causes of work-related pneumonitis. • Moldy conditions in hot tubs also can cause pneumonitis because the bubbling action makes a mist containing mold. • It's common for mold to grow in home humidifiers that aren't cleaned often. • Other examples of humid places where mold can grow and be released into the air include air conditioners, swimming pools, water-damaged carpet and ventilations systems. • Birds. • Exposure to bird feathers, dust or droppings is a common cause of pneumonitis. • Dust. • Exposure to dust from metal work or hardwoods can cause pneumonitis. • Chemicals. • Aerosolized mists, chemicals and pesticides can irritate lungs and cause pneumonitis. • Animal fur. • Skin cells, fur and droppings from animals are another cause of pneumonitis. • This may happen when working closely with cattle and in veterinary practices. • Many medicines can cause pneumonitis. • But the exact reason why certain medicines cause inflamed lung tissue isn't clear. • It's possible that some medicines may irritate lung cells, and then the immune system has a strong response that causes inflammation. • Examples of medicines that may cause pneumonitis include certain antibiotics, many medicines used to treat cancer and some medicines that keep your heartbeat regular. • Some people who have radiation therapy to the chest, such as for breast or lung cancer, may get pneumonitis. • Pneumonitis also can happen after whole-body radiation therapy that's done to prepare a person for a bone marrow transplant. • Symptoms usually appear in the first few months after radiation treatment is finished.",
      "Risk factors": "Some factors cause a higher risk of pneumonitis, including: Jobs and hobbies. • Farming raises exposure to mold particles that can be breathed in during harvests of grain and hay. • Another risk factor is a job where workers are around fine mists, fumes, dust and chemicals. • Woodworking may raise your risk too. • Bird and animal handling. • Poultry workers and people who breed or keep pigeons and other birds often are exposed to droppings, feathers and other materials that can cause pneumonitis. • Being around a lot of animals also may raise your risk. • Using hot tubs and humidifiers. • Moldy conditions in hot tubs, home humidifiers that aren't cleaned often and anywhere else mold can grow are risk factors for pneumonitis. • Some medicines used to treat cancer can cause pneumonitis. • So can radiation therapy to the lungs and chest. • The combination of the two raises the risk of pneumonitis even more. • Genes may play a role in having an extra strong immune response to substances. • If you have family members who have a strong allergic reaction to substances, you may have a higher risk of an allergic reaction as well.",
      "Complications": "If pneumonitis is not detected or not treated, you may gradually develop lung damage that can't be reversed. • In healthy lungs, the air sacs stretch and relax with each breath. • Ongoing inflammation of the thin tissue lining each air sac causes scarring and makes the air sacs less flexible. • They become stiff like a dried sponge. • This is called pulmonary fibrosis. • In severe cases, pulmonary fibrosis can cause high blood pressure in the lungs, right-sided heart failure, respiratory failure or death."

      "Overview": "A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. • A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. • This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. • A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung. • A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. • Or it may occur for no obvious reason. • Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. • On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event. • Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. • However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. • Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed. • Symptoms of a pneumothorax can be caused by a variety of health problems, and some can be life-threatening, so seek medical attention. • If your chest pain is severe or breathing becomes increasingly difficult, get immediate emergency care. • A pneumothorax can be caused by: Chest injury. • Any blunt or penetrating injury to your chest can cause lung collapse. • Some injuries may happen during physical assaults or car crashes, while others may inadvertently occur during medical procedures that involve the insertion of a needle into the chest. • Lung disease. • Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. • Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. • Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax. • Ruptured air blisters. • Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. • These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs. • Mechanical ventilation. • A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. • The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. • The lung may collapse completely. • In general, men are far more likely to have a pneumothorax than women are. • The type of pneumothorax caused by ruptured air blisters is most likely to occur in people between 20 and 40 years old, especially if the person is very tall and underweight. • Underlying lung disease or mechanical ventilation can be a cause or a risk factor for a pneumothorax. • Other risk factors include: Smoking. • The risk increases with the length of time and the number of cigarettes smoked, even without emphysema. • Genetics. • Certain types of pneumothorax appear to run in families. • Previous pneumothorax. • Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another. • Potential complications vary, depending on the size and severity of the pneumothorax as well as the cause and treatment. • Sometimes air may continue to leak if the opening in the lung won't close or pneumothorax may recur.",

      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include: Redness Itching Swelling Blisters Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. • But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. • You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. • The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks. • The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin. • Seek emergency medical attention if: You inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy and are having difficulty breathing

oily resin is very sticky, so it easily attaches to your skin, clothing, tools, equipment and pet's fur. • You can get a poison ivy reaction from: Touching the plant. • If you touch the leaves, stem, roots or berries of the plant, you may have a reaction. • Touching contaminated objects. • If you walk through some poison ivy and then later touch your shoes, you might get urushiol on your hands. • You might then transfer it to your face or body by touching or rubbing. • If the contaminated object isn't cleaned, the urushiol on it can still cause a skin reaction years later. • Inhaling smoke from the burning plants. • Even the smoke from burning poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac can irritate or harm your nasal passages or lungs. • Pus that oozes from blisters doesn't contain

activities that might expose you to these plants, try to stay on cleared pathways. • Wear socks, pants and long sleeves when outdoors. • If camping, make sure you pitch your tent in an area free of these plants. • Keep pets from running through wooded areas so that urushiol doesn't stick to their fur, which you then may touch. • Wear protective clothing. • If needed, protect your skin by wearing socks, boots, pants, long sleeves and heavy gloves. • Remove or kill the plants. • Identify and remove poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac from your yard or garden. • You can get rid of such plants by applying an herbicide or pulling them out of the ground, including the roots, while wearing heavy gloves. • Afterward remove the gloves carefully and wash them and your hands. • Don't burn poison ivy or related plants because the urushiol can be carried by the smoke. • Wash your skin or your pet's fur. • Within 30 minutes after exposure to urushiol, use soap and water to gently wash off the harmful resin from your skin. • Scrub under your fingernails too. • Even washing after an hour or so can help reduce the severity of the rash. • If you think your pet may be contaminated with urushiol, put on some long rubber gloves and give your pet a bath. • Clean contaminated objects. • If you think you've come into contact with poison ivy, wash your clothing promptly in warm soapy water — ideally in a washing machine. • Handle contaminated clothing carefully so that you don't transfer the urushiol to yourself, furniture, rugs or appliances. • Also wash as soon as possible any other items that came in contact with the plant oil — such as outdoor gear, garden tools, jewelry, shoes and even shoelaces. • Urushiol can remain potent for years. • So if you put away a contaminated jacket without washing it and take it out a year later, the oil on the jacket may still cause a rash. • Apply a barrier cream. • Try over-the-counter skin products that are intended to act as a

      "Overview": "Polio is an illness caused by a virus that mainly affects nerves in the spinal cord or brain stem. • In its most severe form, polio can lead to a person being unable to move certain limbs, also called paralysis. • It can also lead to trouble breathing and sometimes death. • The disease also is called poliomyelitis. • A vaccination effort throughout the world has led to only a small number of cases to occur around the world in recent years. • But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates. • The U.S. • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes travel notices of countries where there is a higher risk of polio. • Countries at a higher risk of polio are generally in Africa, the Middle East, and southern and central Asia. • Vaccinated adults who plan to travel to an area where polio is spreading should get a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). • Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.",
      "Symptoms": "Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms. • About 5% of people with the poliovirus get a mild version of the disease called abortive poliomyelitis. • This leads to flu-like symptoms that last 2 to 3 days. • These include: Fever Headache Muscle aches Sore throat Stomachache Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting A more severe form of the disease, called nonparalytic polio, affects about 1% of those infected. • While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn't cause paralysis. • Besides having more-severe flu-like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include: Neck pain or stiffness Aches or stiffness in the arms or legs Severe headache A second phase of symptoms may follow, or a person may seem to be getting better for a few days before a second phase starts. • These symptoms include: Stiffness of the spine and neck Decreased reflexes Muscle weakness This most serious form of the disease is rare. • The disease begins much like nonparalytic polio. • But it progresses to more-severe signs and symptoms, including: Intense pain Extreme sensitivity to touch Tingling or pricking sensations Muscles spasms or twitching Muscles weakness progressing to a limp paralysis Any combination of limbs may experience paralysis. • But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm. • Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include: Paralysis of muscles involved in breathing Difficulty swallowing Post-polio syndrome is the appearance of new signs or symptoms or the progression of problems. • This usually happens decades after having polio. • Common signs and symptoms include: Progressive muscle or joint weakness and pain Fatigue Muscle wasting Breathing or swallowing problems Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea Lowered tolerance of cold temperatures Signs and symptoms of polio are similar to other viral diseases that affect the nervous system. • It's important to get a timely and accurate diagnosis. • If you had polio before, see your health care provider if you have new or worse signs or symptoms.",
      "Causes": "Polio is caused by the poliovirus. • It mainly targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem that control muscle movement. • Nerve cells controlling sensation are generally not affected. • The naturally-occurring poliovirus, called the wild-type poliovirus, has been eliminated in most countries and causes few cases of polio. • Another version of the virus, called the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), is more widespread and now causes most infections worldwide. • VDPV exists mainly in a few countries that use an oral vaccine with a weakened poliovirus. • The weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't itself cause polio, and vaccinated people rarely contract VDPV. • Instead, VDPV is a new version of the virus that develops within a community or region where not enough people are vaccinated. • Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't cause illness, it can spread. • If most people in a community are vaccinated, the spread of the weakened virus is controlled. • If many people aren't vaccinated, the weakened virus can move through a community for a long time. • This gives the virus the chance to change, or mutate, and behave like the wild-type virus that causes illness. • Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States. • In each case, the person was either not vaccinated or had a significantly weakened immune system. • One case in New York in 2022 was in a county with a lower-than-average polio vaccination rate. • Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities. • Since 2000, polio vaccination in the United States has used an injected vaccine with an inactivated poliovirus that doesn't create the risk for VDPV. • People carrying the poliovirus — even people who don't get sick — can pass along the virus in feces, also called stool, or droplets from sneezing or coughing. • The virus enters another person through the mouth. • The virus can spread easily. • For example, the virus can spread if people haven't washed their hands after coughing, using the toilet or before eating. • The virus also may be in water contaminated with feces carrying the poliovirus.",
      "Risk factors": "Polio mainly affects children. • But anyone who hasn't been vaccinated is at risk of getting the disease.",
      "Complications": "Severe disease that affects the ability to breathe can cause death. • Long-term complications for people who recover may include: Permanent paralysis Muscle shortening that causes deformed bones or joints Chronic pain Post-polio syndrome",
      "Prevention": "The most effective way to prevent polio is vaccination. • The CDC recommends four doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at the following ages: 2 months 4 months Between 6 and 18 months Between ages 4 and 6 when children are just entering school If your child is missing a dose, talk to your health care provider about a catch-up schedule for vaccination. • In the U.S., most adults have immunity to the poliovirus because of childhood vaccination. • And U.S. adults have little chance of being exposed to the virus. • But adults who are traveling to or living in a region with high rates of spreading poliovirus should receive more vaccinations. • If you had a complete course of vaccination, you should get a one-time IPV booster. • You should get three IPV doses if you aren't vaccinated, didn't receive a complete vaccination or are unsure of your vaccination status. • The IPV schedule for adults is a second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose. • Then the third dose is 6 to 12 months after the second dose. • Talk to your health care provider if you know you have an incomplete vaccination history. • IPV is safe for people with weakened immune systems, although it's not certain how protective the vaccine is in cases of severe immune deficiency. • Common side effects are pain and redness at the injection site. • IPV can cause an allergic reaction in some people. • Because the vaccine has trace amounts of the antibiotics streptomycin, polymyxin B and neomycin, it may cause a reaction in people allergic to one of these antibiotics. • A person who has a severe reaction to a first dose of IPV won't get more doses. • Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur within minutes to a few hours after the shot. • Watch for: Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin Low blood pressure (hypotension) Narrowing of the airways and a swollen tongue or throat, which can cause wheezing and trouble breathing A weak and fast pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting If you or your child has an allergic reaction after any vaccination, get medical help right away."

      "Overview": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a condition in which clusters of cysts grow in the body, mainly in the kidneys. • Over time, the cysts may cause the kidneys to get bigger and stop working. • PKD is most often passed through families. • This is called an inherited condition. • Cysts are round sacs with fluid in them. • They are not cancer. • In PKD, the cysts vary in size. • They can grow very large. • Having many cysts or large cysts can damage the kidneys. • Polycystic kidney disease also can cause cysts to grow in the liver, the pancreas and other places in the body. • The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure. • PKD varies greatly in how bad it is. • It's possible to prevent some complications. • Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to the kidneys.",
      "Symptoms": "Polycystic kidney disease symptoms can include: High blood pressure. • Belly, side or back pain. • Blood in the urine. • A feeling of fullness in the belly. • Increased size of the belly from enlarged kidneys. • Headaches. • Kidney stones. • Kidney failure. • Urinary tract or kidney infections. • People often have polycystic kidney disease for years without knowing it. • If you have some of the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease, see your healthcare professional. • If you have a parent, sibling or child with polycystic kidney disease, see your healthcare professional to talk about screening for the condition.",
      "Causes": "Gene changes cause polycystic kidney disease. • Most often, the condition runs in families. • Sometimes, a gene change happens on its own in a child. • This is known as a spontaneous gene change. • Then neither parent has a copy of the changed gene. • There are two main types of polycystic kidney disease. • They're caused by different gene changes. • The two types of PKD are: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). • This is the most common type of ongoing kidney disease that's passed through families, also called inherited. • Symptoms of ADPKD often start between the ages of 30 and 40. • Only one parent needs to have the condition to pass it to the children. • If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50% chance of getting the condition. • This is the more common type of polycystic kidney disease. • Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). • This type is far less common than is ADPKD. • The symptoms often appear soon after birth. • Sometimes, symptoms don't appear until later in childhood or during the teen years. • Both parents must have gene changes to pass on this form of the condition. • If both parents carry a changed gene, each child has a 25% chance of getting the condition.",
      "Risk factors": "The biggest risk factor for getting polycystic kidney disease is getting the gene changes that cause the disease from one or both parents.",
      "Complications": "Complications linked to polycystic kidney disease include: High blood pressure. • This is common in polycystic kidney disease. • Not treated, high blood pressure can cause more damage to the kidneys and increase the risk of heart disease and strokes. • Loss of kidney function. • The kidneys' losing their ability to do their work is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. • Nearly half of people with the condition have kidney failure by age 60. • But for some people, it starts in the early 30s. • Pain. • It's common to have pain with polycystic kidney disease. • Pain often is in the side or back. • The pain can come and go or be ongoing. • The pain may be linked to bleeding into a cyst, a urinary tract infection, a kidney stone or, less often, cancer. • Cysts in the liver. • The older people with polycystic kidney disease get, the more likely it is they'll get cysts in the liver. • With cysts, the liver most often keeps working. • Women tend to get larger cysts than do men. • Hormones and pregnancies might be part of the reason. • Brain aneurysm. • A balloonlike bulge in a blood vessel, called an aneurysm, in the brain can cause bleeding if it bursts. • People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysms. • People with a family history of aneurysms seem to be at highest risk. • Ask your healthcare professional if you need screening. • If screening doesn't show an aneurysm, your healthcare professional may suggest screening again in a few years. • The timing of repeat screening depends on your risk. • Pregnancy complications. • Most people with polycystic kidney disease can have success with pregnancy. • But sometimes, they can get a life-threatening condition called preeclampsia during pregnancy. • Those most at risk have high blood pressure or a loss of kidney function before they become pregnant. • Heart valve conditions. • As many as 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease gets mitral valve prolapse. • When this happens, the heart valve no longer closes well. • This lets blood leak backward. • Colon conditions. • People with polycystic kidney disease may get weaknesses and pouches or sacs called diverticula in the wall of the colon. • This condition is called diverticulosis. • Diverticula most often don't cause symptoms, but they may bleed or get infected.",
      "Prevention": "If you have polycystic kidney disease and you're thinking about having children, a genetic counselor can help you know your risk of passing the disease to your children. • Keeping your kidneys as healthy as possible may help prevent some of the complications of this disease. • It's most important to manage your blood pressure. • Here are some tips for keeping your blood pressure in check: Take the blood pressure medicines your healthcare professional prescribes as directed. • Eat a low-salt diet that has plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Get to and stay at a healthy weight. • Exercise regularly. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. • Limit alcohol use. • Don't smoke."

      "Overview": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem with hormones that happens during the reproductive years. • If you have PCOS, you may not have periods very often. • Or you may have periods that last many days. • You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body. • With PCOS, many small sacs of fluid develop along the outer edge of the ovary. • These are called cysts. • The small fluid-filled cysts contain immature eggs. • These are called follicles. • The follicles fail to regularly release eggs. • The exact cause of PCOS is unknown. • Early diagnosis and treatment along with weight loss may lower the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of PCOS often start around the time of the first menstrual period. • Sometimes symptoms develop later after you have had periods for a while. • The symptoms of PCOS vary. • A diagnosis of PCOS is made when you have at least two of these: Irregular periods. • Having few menstrual periods or having periods that aren't regular are common signs of PCOS. • So is having periods that last for many days or longer than is typical for a period. • For example, you might have fewer than nine periods a year. • And those periods may occur more than 35 days apart. • You may have trouble getting pregnant. • Too much androgen. • High levels of the hormone androgen may result in excess facial and body hair. • This is called hirsutism. • Sometimes, severe acne and male-pattern baldness can happen, too. • Polycystic ovaries. • Your ovaries might be bigger. • Many follicles containing immature eggs may develop around the edge of the ovary. • The ovaries might not work the way they should. • PCOS signs and symptoms are typically more severe in people with obesity. • See your health care provider if you're worried about your periods, if you're having trouble getting pregnant, or if you have signs of excess androgen. • These might include new hair growth on your face and body, acne and male-pattern baldness. • The exact cause of PCOS isn't known. • Factors that might play a role include: Insulin resistance. • Insulin is a hormone that the pancreas makes. • It allows cells to use sugar, your body's primary energy supply. • If cells become resistant to the action of insulin, then blood sugar levels can go up. • This can cause your body to make more insulin to try to bring down the blood sugar level. • Too much insulin might cause your body to make too much of the male hormone androgen. • You could have trouble with ovulation, the process where eggs are released from the ovary. • One sign of insulin resistance is dark, velvety patches of skin on the lower part of the neck, armpits, groin or under the breasts. • A bigger appetite and weight gain may be other signs. • Low-grade inflammation. • White blood cells make substances in response to infection or injury. • This response is called low-grade inflammation. • Research shows that people with PCOS have a type of long-term, low-grade inflammation that leads polycystic ovaries to produce androgens. • This can lead to heart and blood vessel problems. • Heredity. • Research suggests that certain genes might be linked to PCOS. • Having a family history of PCOS may play a role in developing the condition. • Excess androgen. • With PCOS, the ovaries may produce high levels of androgen. • Having too much androgen interferes with ovulation. • This means that eggs don't develop on a regular basis and aren't released from the follicles where they develop. • Excess androgen also can result in hirsutism and acne. • Complications of PCOS can include: Infertility Gestational diabetes or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure Miscarriage or premature birth Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis — a severe liver inflammation caused by fat buildup in the liver Metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and unhealthy cholesterol or triglyceride levels that significantly increase your risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes Sleep apnea Depression, anxiety and eating disorders Cancer of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer) Obesity commonly occurs with PCOS and can worsen complications of the disorder.",

      "Overview": "Polyhydramnios (pol-e-hi-DRAM-nee-os) is the buildup of increased amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds the baby in the uterus during pregnancy. • Polyhydramnios happens in about 1% to 2% of pregnancies. • Most of the time, the condition is mild. • It's often found during the middle or later stages of pregnancy. • Severe polyhydramnios may cause shortness of breath, preterm labor or other symptoms. • If you learn that you have polyhydramnios, your health care team carefully tracks your pregnancy to help prevent health problems. • Treatment depends on how serious the condition is. • Mild polyhydramnios may go away on its own. • Severe polyhydramnios may need to be watched more closely by your care team.",
      "Symptoms": "Polyhydramnios symptoms may be linked with the buildup of amniotic fluid creating pressure within the uterus and on nearby organs. • Mild polyhydramnios often causes few or no symptoms. • But serious forms of the condition may cause: Shortness of breath or not being able to breathe. • Swelling in the ankles or feet. • Pain in the stomach area. • Feelings of tightness in the muscles of the uterus, called contractions. • Your health care professional also may also suspect polyhydramnios if your uterus has become large for the number of weeks of pregnancy.",
      "Causes": "Some of the known causes of polyhydramnios include: Conditions that affect the baby's digestive tract, central nervous system or certain other organs. • Genetic conditions that affect the baby. • Diabetes in the pregnant person. • A complication of identical twin pregnancies in which one twin receives too much blood and the other too little. • This is called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. • A decreased amount of red blood cells in the baby, also called fetal anemia. • A condition in which the pregnant parent's blood cells attack the baby's blood cells. • Infection during pregnancy. • Often, the cause of polyhydramnios isn't clear, especially when the condition is mild.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for polyhydramnios include certain conditions that develop during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes. • A condition that affects the developing baby, such as a problem with the digestive tract, central nervous system or other organs, may also put you at risk of polyhydramnios.",
      "Complications": "Polyhydramnios is linked with: The baby being born too early, also called premature birth. • The baby not being head-down in the ideal position before delivery, also called a breech birth. • The water breaking early, also called premature rupture of membranes. • The baby's umbilical cord dropping into the vagina ahead of the baby, also called umbilical cord prolapse. • The organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby, the placenta, peeling away from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. • This is called placental abruption. • Need for a C-section delivery. • Pregnancy loss after 20 weeks, also called stillbirth. • Heavy bleeding due to decreased uterine muscle tone after delivery. • Greater health problems usually are linked with severe polyhydramnios."

      "Overview": "Polymyositis (pol-e-my-o-SY-tis) is an uncommon inflammatory disease that causes muscle weakness affecting both sides of your body. • Having this condition can make it difficult to climb stairs, rise from a seated position, lift objects or reach overhead. • Polymyositis most commonly affects adults in their 30s, 40s or 50s. • Women are affected more often than men. • Signs and symptoms usually develop gradually, over weeks or months. • While there is no cure for polymyositis, treatment — ranging from medications to physical therapy — can improve your muscle strength and function.",
      "Symptoms": "The muscle weakness associated with polymyositis involves the muscles closest to the trunk, such as those in your hips, thighs, shoulders, upper arms and neck. • The weakness affects both the left and right sides of your body, and tends to gradually worsen. • Seek medical attention if you develop unexplained muscle weakness.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of polymyositis is unknown, but the disease shares many characteristics with autoimmune disorders, in which your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body tissues.",
      "Risk factors": "Your risk of polymyositis is higher if you have lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or Sjogren's syndrome.",
      "Complications": "Possible complications of polymyositis include: Difficulty swallowing. • If the muscles in your esophagus are affected, you may have problems swallowing (dysphagia), which in turn may cause weight loss and malnutrition. • Aspiration pneumonia. • Difficulty swallowing may also cause you to breathe food or liquids, including saliva, into your lungs (aspiration), which can lead to pneumonia. • Breathing problems. • If your chest muscles are affected by the disease, you may experience breathing problems, such as shortness of breath or, in severe cases, respiratory failure. • Although these are not complications, polymyositis is often associated with other conditions that may cause further complications of their own, or in combination with polymyositis symptoms. • Associated conditions include: Raynaud's phenomenon. • This is a condition in which your fingers, toes, cheeks, nose and ears initially turn pale when exposed to cold temperatures. • Other connective tissue diseases. • Other conditions, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and Sjogren's syndrome, can occur in combination with polymyositis. • Cardiovascular disease. • Polymyositis may cause the muscular walls of your heart to become inflamed (myocarditis). • In a small number of people who have polymyositis, congestive heart failure and heart arrhythmias may develop. • Lung disease. • A condition called interstitial lung disease may occur with polymyositis. • Interstitial lung disease refers to a group of disorders that cause scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue, making lungs stiff and inelastic. • Signs and symptoms include a dry cough and shortness of breath. • Cancer. • People who have polymyositis have an elevated risk of cancer."

      "Overview": "A popliteal artery aneurysm is an irregular bulge that occurs in the wall of the artery located behind the knee joint. • It is a type of lower extremity aneurysm.",
      "Symptoms": "You might not notice any symptoms. • The first symptom may be pain in the lower leg that occurs with walking, called claudication. • Other symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include: Knee pain. • Lower leg pain. • Swelling behind the knee. • Pulsing feeling behind the knee.",
      "Causes": "An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. • Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including: Atherosclerosis. • High blood pressure. • Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repeat use of the knee joint.",
      "Risk factors": "Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. • They are more common in men than in women. • Popliteal artery aneurysm often occurs in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). • An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. • Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA. • Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include: Growing older. • High blood pressure. • Smoking. • Narrowing of a heart valve. • Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body.",
      "Complications": "Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots. • Blood clots can cause a severe lack of blood flow in the lower leg. • A severe lack of blood flow can cause the following symptoms: A change in skin color in the affected area. • No pulse behind the knee. • Skin in the affected area feels cold. • Numbness in the leg. • Inability to move the foot. • A severe lack of blood flow may result in loss of the limb. • Rarely, the aneurysm may rupture. • But the risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low.",
      "Prevention": "Smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of blood vessel problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. • Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Do not smoke. • Eat a nutritious diet. • Get regular exercise."

      "Overview": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is an uncommon condition that affects the main artery behind the knee. • That artery is called the popliteal artery. • In this condition, the calf muscle is in the wrong position or it's larger than usual. • The muscle presses on the artery. • The artery becomes trapped, making it harder for blood to flow to the lower leg and foot. • Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is most common among athletes.",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is pain or cramping in the back of the lower leg. • The back of the lower leg is called the calf. • The pain occurs during exercise and goes away with rest. • Other symptoms may include: Cold feet after exercise. • Tingling or burning in your calf. • Numbness in the calf area. • If the nearby vein, called the popliteal vein, also becomes trapped by the calf muscle, you may have: A heavy feeling in the leg. • Lower leg cramping at night. • Swelling in the calf area. • Changes in skin color around the calf muscle. • Blood clot in the lower leg, called deep vein thrombosis. • Symptoms typically affect young, otherwise healthy people under age 40. • Make an appointment for a health checkup if you have any type of leg pain. • This is especially important if you have calf or foot cramping during activity that gets better with rest.",
      "Causes": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is caused by an irregular calf muscle, usually the gastrocnemius muscle. • The condition may be seen at birth, or it may occur later in life. • When it's present at birth, the baby's calf muscle or nearby artery forms in the wrong place during pregnancy. • People who get the condition later in life have a calf muscle that is bigger than usual. • The changes in the calf muscle cause it to press on the main artery behind the knee. • This reduces blood flow to the lower leg. • The lack of blood flow causes pain and cramping in the back of the lower leg during times of activity.",
      "Risk factors": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is uncommon. • The following things increase the risk of the condition. • Younger age. • The condition is most often seen in people who are in their late teens or 20s. • It's rarely diagnosed in those over age 40. • Being male. • PAES can occur in anyone, but it's much more common in young men. • Strenuous athletic activity. • Runners, bicyclists, and athletes who try to build muscle fast with weight training routines or high-intensity circuit training are at the highest risk.",
      "Complications": "Long-term pressure on the popliteal artery can cause the artery to narrow. • This is called artery stenosis. • It can cause pain and cramping with just slight activity, such as walking. • In severe cases or when undiagnosed, the nerves and muscles in the leg can become damaged. • Blood clots may occur in the lower leg. • Older athletes with symptoms of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome should be checked for a ballooning or bulging of the artery. • This is called a popliteal aneurysm. • It is common in older men."
