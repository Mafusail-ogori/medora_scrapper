      "Overview": "A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back that is present at birth in some babies. • It's usually just above the crease between the buttocks. • Most sacral dimples are harmless and don't need treatment. • A sacral dimple can be a sign of a serious spinal problem in a newborn if the dimple is large or appears near a tuft of hair, skin tag, lump or discolored area. • In these instances, your child's health care provider may recommend an imaging test. • If a spinal problem is found, treatment depends on the underlying cause.",
      "Symptoms": "A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back. • It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks.",
      "Causes": "There are no known causes for a sacral dimple. • It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for sacral dimples include being born with a spinal cord problem, such as tethered cord syndrome. • In this condition the spinal cord doesn't hang free within the spinal canal. • Sacral dimples also can be present in newborns without other health conditions.",
      "Complications": "Rarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. • Examples include: Spina bifida. • A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. • In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn't need treatment. • Tethered cord syndrome. • A spinal cord typically hangs freely within the spinal canal. • Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. • Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence. • The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration."

      "Overview": "Sarcoidosis is a condition that causes tiny collections of immune system cells in any part of the body. • These tiny collections form red, swollen lumps called granulomas. • Granulomas most commonly occur in the lungs and the lymph nodes of the chest. • They also can occur in the eyes, skin, heart and other organs. • Experts don't know the exact cause of sarcoidosis, but it's likely a mix of genetic and environmental factors. • Some people appear to have gene changes that make them more likely to develop sarcoidosis. • The condition may then be triggered by bacteria, viruses, dust or chemicals. • Their immune system overreacts to the trigger, causing inflammation that forms granulomas. • There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but most people do not need treatment. • Sarcoidosis may go away on its own. • Other people need treatment to lessen their body's immune system response. • Sometimes sarcoidosis can last for years and may cause organ damage.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of sarcoidosis vary, depending on which organs are affected and how badly they're affected. • Sarcoidosis sometimes develops slowly over time and causes symptoms that last for years. • Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. • Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the condition is found only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason. • Sarcoidosis can begin with these symptoms: Extreme tiredness. • Slight fever. • Swollen lymph nodes, such as in the chest, neck, armpits or groin. • Weight loss. • Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles. • Sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as: Ongoing dry cough. • Shortness of breath. • A squeaking sound when breathing out, called wheezing. • Chest pain. • Sarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include: A rash of small, itchy bumps, usually on the head, neck or legs. • The rash may be painful. • Open sores on the nose, lips, cheeks and ears, called skin lesions. • Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color. • Growths under the skin, especially around scars or tattoos. • Sarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it's important to have your eyes checked regularly. • When eye symptoms do occur, they may include: Blurred vision. • Eye pain. • Watery eyes. • Burning, itching or dry eyes. • Severe redness. • Sensitivity to light. • Symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include: Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Fainting. • Heartbeats that aren't regular, called arrhythmias. • Rapid or fluttering heartbeats, called palpitations. • Swelling caused by extra fluid in the body. • Sarcoidosis can cause symptoms related to the brain and nerves, such as: Headaches. • Dizziness. • Changes in vision. • Confusion. • Weakness. • Nerve pain, numbness or tingling. • Seizures. • Other symptoms are usually linked with the organs affected. • Sarcoidosis can cause granulomas in any part of the body, such as the liver, spleen, muscles, bones and joints, kidneys, and lymph nodes. • See a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have symptoms that may be sarcoidosis. • The cause of sarcoidosis is not known. • Experts think it results from a mix of genetic and environmental factors that cause the body's immune system to overreact to a substance it doesn't know. • Some people have gene changes that make their immune system more likely to overreact to triggers. • Triggers could be bacteria, viruses, chemicals or dust. • This causes immune cells to group into tiny collections of inflamed lumps called granulomas. • As granulomas build up in an organ, the function of that organ can be affected. • While anyone can develop sarcoidosis, factors that may raise your risk include: Age and sex. • Sarcoidosis can happen at any age, but often occurs between the ages of 20 and 60 years. • Women are slightly more likely to develop the condition than are men. • Race. • Sarcoidosis occurs more often in people of African descent and those of Northern European descent. • African Americans are more likely to have sarcoidosis in other organs along with the lungs. • Job or hobbies. • Working around chemicals and dust can raise your risk. • Family history. • If someone in your family has had sarcoidosis, you're more likely to get the condition. • Sometimes sarcoidosis causes long-term problems. • Lungs. • Pulmonary sarcoidosis that isn't treated can lead to scarring in the lungs that lasts forever. • This scarring is called pulmonary fibrosis. • Pulmonary fibrosis makes it hard to breathe and sometimes causes pulmonary hypertension. • Eyes. • Inflammation can affect almost any part of the eye. • It may cause damage to the retina, which over time can affect vision. • Sarcoidosis can cause cataracts and glaucoma. • Kidneys. • Sarcoidosis can affect how your body handles calcium. • Sarcoidosis can result in too much calcium in the bloodstream, a condition called hypercalcemia. • This can lead to kidney stones and affect how well the kidneys work. • Rarely, long-term kidney disease can occur. • Heart. • Cardiac sarcoidosis results in granulomas in the heart. • These can cause problems with heart rhythm, blood flow and heart function. • Rarely, sarcoidosis results in heart problems that may cause death. • Nervous system. • Some people with sarcoidosis develop problems related to the central nervous system. • This occurs when granulomas form in the nerves, brain and spinal cord. • For example, granulomas in the facial nerves can cause paralyzed facial muscles.",

      "Risk factors": "Factors that raise the risk of developing schizoaffective disorder include: Having a close blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, who has schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. • Stressful events that may cause symptoms. • Taking mind-altering drugs, which may make symptoms worse when an underlying problem is present.",
      "Complications": "People with schizoaffective disorder are at a greater risk of: Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts about suicide. • Social isolation. • Conflicts with others and within families. • Unemployment. • Anxiety disorders. • Alcohol or other substance misuse. • Health conditions, such as heart disease, stroke and obesity. • Being poor and not having a home. • Being assaulted. • Aggressive episodes, though people with schizoaffective disorder are more likely to be assaulted rather than assault others."

      "Overview": "Schizoid personality disorder is a condition where a person shows very little, if any, interest and ability to form relationships with other people. • It's very hard for the person to express a full range of emotions. • If you have schizoid personality disorder, you may be seen as keeping to yourself or rejecting others. • You may not be interested in or able to form close friendships or romantic relationships. • Because you do not tend to show emotion, it may appear that you do not care about others or what's going on around you. • Schizoid personality disorder is less common than other personality disorders, but it's much more common than schizophrenia. • The cause is not known. • Some symptoms of schizoid personality disorder are similar to autism spectrum disorders, other personality disorders — especially avoidant personality disorder — and early symptoms of schizophrenia. • Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, can help those who know they need to improve relationships with others. • But it's common to feel unsure about change. • Medicines are mainly used to treat mental health conditions that occur along with schizoid personality disorder, rather than the disorder itself.",
      "Symptoms": "If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you: Want to be alone and do activities alone. • Do not want or enjoy close relationships. • Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships. • Take pleasure in few activities, if any. • Find it hard to express your emotions and react. • May lack humor or not be interested in others. • Or you may be cold toward others. • May lack the drive that makes you want to reach goals. • Do not react to praise or criticism from others. • People may view you as odd or unusual. • Schizoid personality disorder most often begins when a person is a young adult. • But some symptoms might be noticed during childhood. • These symptoms may make it hard to do well in school, at work, in social situations or in other areas of life. • But the person may do well if the job can be done by mostly working alone. • Although the names may sound alike, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders are all different types of mental health conditions. • But they can have similar symptoms, such as not being able to make social connections or show a full range of emotions. • In contrast to schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, people with schizoid personality disorder: Are in touch with reality. • Are not likely to feel paranoid, hold bizarre beliefs or hallucinate. • Make sense when speaking. • Although the tone may not be lively, the content of the person's speech is not strange or hard to follow. • People with schizoid personality disorder typically only seek treatment for a related problem, such as depression. • If someone close to you has urged you to seek help for symptoms common to schizoid personality disorder, make an appointment with a doctor or another health care professional, or a mental health professional. • If you suspect a loved one may have schizoid personality disorder, gently suggest that the person seek help. • You can offer to go along to the first appointment.",
      "Causes": "Personality is the blend of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes you special. • It's the way you view, understand and relate to the outside world. • It's also how you see yourself. • Personality forms when you're a child. • It's shaped through a blend of your surroundings and genes passed down from your parents. • Children typically learn over time to properly understand social cues and take action. • What causes schizoid personality disorder to happen is not known. • But a blend of your surroundings and genes passed down to you may play a role in developing the disorder.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that raise your risk of schizoid personality disorder include: Having a parent or another relative who has schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder or schizophrenia. • Having a parent who was cold, did not properly care for you and did not take action to help you emotionally.",
      "Complications": "People with schizoid personality disorder are at higher risk of: Schizotypal personality disorder or schizophrenia. • Other personality disorders. • Major depression. • Anxiety disorders."

      "Overview": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that affects how people think, feel and behave. • It may result in a mix of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior. • Hallucinations involve seeing things or hearing voices that aren't observed by others. • Delusions involve firm beliefs about things that are not true. • People with schizophrenia can seem to lose touch with reality, which can make daily living very hard. • People with schizophrenia need lifelong treatment. • This includes medicine, talk therapy and help in learning how to manage daily life activities. • Because many people with schizophrenia don't know they have a mental health condition and may not believe they need treatment, many research studies have examined the results of untreated psychosis. • People who have psychosis that is not treated often have more-severe symptoms, more stays in a hospital, poorer thinking and processing skills and social outcomes, injuries, and even death. • On the other hand, early treatment often helps control symptoms before serious complications arise, making the long-term outlook better.",
      "Symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems in how people think, feel and behave. • Symptoms may include: Delusions. • This is when people believe in things that aren't real or true. • For example, people with schizophrenia could think that they're being harmed or harassed when they aren't. • They could think that they're the target for certain gestures or comments when they aren't. • They may think they're very famous or have great ability when that's not the case. • Or they could feel that a major disaster is about to occur when that's not true. • Most people with schizophrenia have delusions. • Hallucinations. • These usually involve seeing or hearing things that other people don't observe. • For people with schizophrenia, these things seem real. • Hallucinations can occur with any of the senses, but hearing voices is most common. • Disorganized speech and thinking. • Disorganized speech causes disorganized thinking. • It can be hard for people with schizophrenia to talk with other people. • The answers people with schizophrenia give to questions may not be related to what's being asked. • Or questions may not be answered fully. • Rarely, speech may include putting together unrelated words in a way that can't be understood. • Sometimes this is called word salad. • Extremely disorganized or unusual motor behavior. • This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to being agitated for no reason. • Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. • People with schizophrenia may not want to follow instructions. • They may move in ways that are not typical or not appropriate to the social setting. • Or they may not move much or respond at all. • Negative symptoms. • People with schizophrenia may not be able to function in the way they could before their illness started. • For example, they may not bathe, make eye contact or show emotions. • They may speak in a monotone voice and not be able to feel pleasure. • Also, they may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw and have a hard time planning ahead. • Symptoms can vary in type and how severe they are. • At times, symptoms may get better or worse. • Some symptoms may be present at all times. • People with schizophrenia usually are diagnosed in the late teen years to early 30s. • In men, schizophrenia symptoms usually start in the late teens to early 20s. • In women, symptoms usually begin in the late 20s to early 30s. • There also is a group of people — usually women — who are diagnosed later in life. • It isn't common for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. • Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are like those in adults, but the condition may be harder to pinpoint. • That's because some early symptoms of schizophrenia — those that occur before hallucinations, delusions and disorganization — are commonly seen in many teens, such as: Withdrawing from friends and family. • Not doing well in school. • Having trouble sleeping. • Feeling irritable or depressed. • Lacking motivation. • Also, the use of recreational drugs, such as marijuana, stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamines, or hallucinogens, can cause similar symptoms. • Compared with adults with schizophrenia, teens with the condition may be less likely to have delusions and more likely to have hallucinations. • People with schizophrenia often don't know that they have a mental condition that needs medical attention. • As a result, family or friends often need to get them help. • If people you know have symptoms of schizophrenia, talk to them about your concerns. • While you can't force them to seek help, you can offer encouragement and support. • You also can help them find a healthcare professional or mental health professional. • If people are a danger to themselves or others, or they don't have food, clothing or shelter, you may need to call 911 in the U.S. or other emergency responders for help. • A mental health professional needs to evaluate them. • Some people may need an emergency stay in a hospital. • Laws on mental health treatment against a person's will vary by state. • You can contact community mental health agencies or police departments in your area for details. • Suicidal thoughts and attempts are much higher than average in people with schizophrenia. • If a person is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure that someone stays with that person. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • Proper treatment of schizophrenia can reduce the risk of suicide. • It isn't known what causes schizophrenia. • But researchers believe that a mix of genetics, brain chemistry and environment can play a part. • Changes in certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may play a part in schizophrenia. • Neuroimaging studies show changes in the brain structure and central nervous systems of people with schizophrenia. • While researchers haven't yet been able to apply these findings to new treatments, the findings show that schizophrenia is a brain disease. • Although the cause of schizophrenia is not known, these factors seem to make schizophrenia more likely: A family history of schizophrenia. • Life experiences, such as living in poverty, stress or danger. • Some pregnancy and birth issues, such as not getting enough nutrition before or after birth, low birth weight, or exposure to toxins or viruses before birth that may affect brain development. • Taking mind-altering — also called psychoactive or psychotropic — drugs as a teen or young adult. • Left untreated, schizophrenia can lead to severe problems that affect every area of life. • Complications that schizophrenia may cause or be related to include: Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide. • Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, also known as OCD. • Depression. • Misuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine. • Not being able to work or attend school. • Money problems and homelessness. • Social isolation. • Health and medical problems. • Being victimized. • Aggressive or violent behavior, though people with schizophrenia are more likely to be assaulted rather than assault others. • There's no sure way to prevent schizophrenia. • But staying with your treatment plan can help stop symptoms from returning or getting worse. • Researchers hope that learning more about risk factors for schizophrenia may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.",

      "Overview": "People with schizotypal personality disorder are often described as odd or eccentric, and they usually have few, if any, close relationships. • They generally don't know how relationships form or how their behavior affects others. • They also tend to misinterpret others' motivations and behaviors and greatly distrust others. • These problems may lead to severe anxiety and a tendency to stay away from social situations. • That's because people with schizotypal personality disorder tend to hold odd beliefs and may find it hard to respond correctly to social cues. • Schizotypal personality disorder usually is diagnosed in early adulthood, although some features of this condition may show up during childhood and the teen years. • It's likely to be a lifelong condition. • Treatments, such as medicines and therapy, can make symptoms better.",
      "Symptoms": "Schizotypal personality disorder usually includes five or more of these symptoms. • The person may: Be a loner and lack close friends and other relationships outside of the immediate family. • Have flat emotions or have emotional responses that are limited or not proper socially. • Have too much social anxiety, which is ongoing. • Incorrectly interpret events, such as feeling that something harmless or not offensive has a direct personal meaning. • Have strange or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms. • Have suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others. • Believe in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions. • Have unusual thoughts, such as sensing an absent person's presence, or having illusions. • Dress in odd ways, such as appearing messy or wearing oddly matched clothes. • Speak in an odd way, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or ramble oddly while speaking. • Symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as more interest in activities done alone or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years. • The child may not do well in school or appear socially out of step with peers. • This may lead to teasing or bullying. • It's easy to confuse schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia, which is a severe mental health condition where people struggle with interpreting and managing reality. • This is known as psychosis. • People with schizotypal personality disorder may have brief psychotic bouts with delusions or hallucinations. • But the bouts aren't as often, as long or as intense as with schizophrenia. • Another key difference is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of how their distorted ideas differ from reality. • Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. • Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments like those used for schizophrenia. • Sometimes schizotypal personality disorder is thought to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe. • People with schizotypal personality disorder are likely to seek help only at the urging of friends or family members. • Or people with schizotypal personality disorder may seek help for another problem such as depression, anxiety or substance misuse. • If you think that a friend or family member may have the condition, consider gently suggesting that the person seek the help of a healthcare professional or mental health professional. • If you're concerned that you might harm yourself or someone else, go to an emergency department or call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number right away. • Or contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free).",

      "Overview": "Schwannomatosis is a condition that results in slow-growing tumors on nerve tissue. • The tumors can grow on nerves in the ears, brain, spine and eyes. • They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. • Schwannomatosis is rare. • It's usually diagnosed in early adulthood. • There are three types of schwannomatosis. • Each type is caused by an altered gene. • In NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2), tumors grow in both ears and can cause hearing loss. • The altered gene that causes this type is sometimes passed down from a parent. • NF2-related schwannomatosis was previously known as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). • The other two types of schwannomatosis are SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. • The altered genes that cause these types usually are not passed down through families. • The tumors caused by schwannomatosis usually are not cancerous. • Symptoms can include headaches, hearing loss, trouble with balance and pain. • Treatment focuses on managing symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Schwannomatosis symptoms depend on the type. • Symptoms of NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2) usually result from slow-growing tumors in both ears, known as acoustic neuromas or vestibular schwannomas. • The tumors are benign, which means that they are not cancerous. • The tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. • These tumors can cause hearing loss. • Symptoms tend to appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary. • Symptoms may include: Gradual hearing loss. • Ringing in the ears. • Poor balance. • Headaches. • Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of tumors on other nerves, including in the brain, spine and eyes. • They also can grow on peripheral nerves, which are located outside of the brain and spinal cord. • People who have NF2 also may develop other benign tumors. • Symptoms of these tumors can include: Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs. • Pain. • Poor balance. • Facial drop. • Changes in vision or cataracts. • Seizures. • Headaches. • These two types of schwannomatosis typically affect people after age 20. • Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. • SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis can cause tumors to grow on nerves in the brain, spine and eyes. • Tumors also may grow on peripheral nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. • Symptoms of SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis include: Long-lasting pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling. • Numbness or weakness in various parts of the body. • Loss of muscle, known as atrophy. • These types of schwannomatosis also can cause tumors to grow in the ear. • But it happens rarely, and tumors usually grow in only one ear. • This differs from NF2, which causes tumors to grow in both ears. • For this reason, people with SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis don't have the same hearing loss as people who have NF2. • See a healthcare professional if you have symptoms of schwannomatosis. • Although there is no cure, complications can be treated.",
      "Causes": "Schwannomatosis is caused by an altered gene. • The specific genes involved depend on the type: NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2). • The NF2 gene produces a protein called merlin, also called schwannomin, that suppresses tumors. • An altered gene causes a loss of merlin, leading to cell growth that's not controlled. • SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. • So far, two genes are known to cause these types of schwannomatosis. • Changes of the genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which suppress tumors, are linked with these conditions.",
      "Risk factors": "The gene that causes schwannomatosis is sometimes passed down from a parent. • The risk of inheriting the gene differs based on the type of schwannomatosis. • For about half of people who have NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2), they received an altered gene from a parent that caused the disease. • NF2 has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. • This means that any child of a parent who is affected by the disease has a 50% chance of having the gene change. • People who have NF2 and whose relatives aren't affected are likely to have a new gene change. • In SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis, the disease is less likely to be passed down from a parent. • Researchers estimate that the risk of inheriting SMARCB1- and LZTR1-related schwannomatosis from an affected parent is about 15%.",
      "Complications": "Complications can occur in schwannomatosis, and they depend on the type the person has. • NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2) complications can include: Partial or total hearing loss. • Facial nerve damage. • Vision changes. • Small benign skin tumors, known as skin schwannomas. • Weakness or numbness in the legs or arms. • Having many benign brain tumors or spinal tumors, known as meningiomas. • These require frequent surgeries. • The pain caused by this type of schwannomatosis can be weakening. • People with this type may need surgery or management by a pain specialist."

      "Overview": "Sciatica refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve. • The sciatic nerve travels from the buttocks and down each leg. • Sciatica most often happens when a herniated disk or an overgrowth of bone puts pressure on the lumbar spine nerve roots. • This happens \"upstream\" from the sciatic nerve. • This causes inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg. • Although the pain associated with sciatica can be serious, those cases that are caused by a herniated disk can clear up with treatment in a few weeks to months. • People who have severe sciatica and serious leg weakness or bowel or bladder changes might need surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "Sciatica pain can be almost anywhere along the nerve pathway. • It's especially likely to follow a path from the low back to the buttock and the back of a thigh and calf. • The pain can vary from a mild ache to a sharp, burning pain. • Sometimes it feels like a jolt or electric shock. • It can be worse when coughing or sneezing or sitting a long time. • Usually, sciatica affects only one side of the body. • Some people also have numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness in the leg or foot. • One part of the leg can be in pain, while another part can feel numb. • Mild sciatica usually goes away over time. • Call your primary care professional if self-care measures don't ease symptoms. • Also call if pain lasts longer than a week, is severe or gets worse. • Get immediate medical care for: Sudden numbness or muscle weakness in a leg. • Pain after a violent injury, such as a traffic accident. • Trouble controlling bowels or bladder. • Sciatica occurs when the nerve roots to the sciatic nerve become pinched. • The cause is usually a herniated disk in the spine or an overgrowth of bone, sometimes called bone spurs, on the spinal bones. • More rarely, a tumor can put pressure on the nerve. • Risk factors for sciatica include: Age. • People ages 20 to 50 are most likely to have herniated disks. • Bone spurs develop more commonly as people age. • Obesity. • Being overweight increases stress on the spine. • Occupation. • A job that requires twisting the back, carrying heavy loads or driving a motor vehicle for long periods might play a role in herniated disks. • Prolonged sitting. • People who sit a lot or don't move much are more likely to develop herniated disks than active people are. • Diabetes. • This condition, which affects the way the body uses blood sugar, increases the risk of nerve damage. • Most people recover fully from sciatica caused by herniated disks, often without treatment. • But sciatica can damage nerves. • Seek immediate medical attention for: Loss of feeling in the affected leg. • Weakness in the affected leg. • Loss of bowel or bladder control. • It's not always possible to prevent sciatica, and the condition can come back. • To protect your back: Exercise regularly. • To keep the back strong, work the core muscles — the muscles in the abdomen and lower back needed for good posture and alignment. • A healthcare professional can recommend activities. • Keep good posture when sitting. • Choose a seat with good lower back support, armrests and a swivel base. • For better low back support, place a pillow or rolled towel in the small of the back to keep its normal curve. • Keep knees and hips level. • Use your body correctly. • When standing for long periods, rest one foot on a stool or small box from time to time. • When lifting something heavy, let your legs do the work. • Hold the load close to your body. • Don't lift and twist at the same time. • Find someone to help lift heavy or awkward things.",

      "Overview": "Scleroderma (sklair-oh-DUR-muh), also known as systemic sclerosis, is a group of rare diseases that involve the hardening and tightening of the skin. • Scleroderma also may cause problems in the blood vessels, internal organs and digestive tract. • Scleroderma is often categorized as limited or diffuse, which refers only to the degree of skin involvement. • Both types can involve any of the other vascular or organ symptoms that are part of the disease. • Localized scleroderma, also known as morphea, affects only the skin. • While there is no cure for scleroderma, treatments can ease symptoms, slow progression and improve quality of life.",
      "Symptoms": "Scleroderma symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. • Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences hardening and tightening of the skin. • The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. • In some people, the skin thickening also can involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. • Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. • The color of affected skin can become lighter or darker, and skin may look shiny because of the tightness. • Some people also have small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. • Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. • Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma. • It happens because of an exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to cold temperatures or emotional distress. • When this happens, the digits may feel painful or numb and turn white, blue, gray or red. • Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. • Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. • Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, symptoms may include: Heartburn. • Difficulty swallowing. • Bloating. • Diarrhea. • Constipation. • Fecal incontinence. • When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. • Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. • There are medicines that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. • Scleroderma also can cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. • This is called pulmonary hypertension. • In addition to causing shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension also can cause excess fluid to build up in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. • When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. • Heart failure also may happen in some people. • Scleroderma happens when the body produces too much collagen and it builds up in body tissues. • Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up the body's connective tissues, including the skin. • Experts don't know exactly what causes this process to begin, but the body's immune system appears to play a role. • Most likely, scleroderma is caused by a combination of factors, including immune system problems, genetics and environmental triggers. • Anyone can get scleroderma, but it is more common in people assigned female at birth. • People typically get scleroderma between ages 30 and 50. • Black people often have earlier onset and are more likely to have more skin involvement and lung disease. • Several other combined factors appear to influence the risk of having scleroderma: Genetics. • People who have certain gene changes appear to be more likely to develop scleroderma. • This may explain why scleroderma appears to run in families in a small number of people and why some types of scleroderma are more common for people in certain racial and ethnic groups. • Environmental triggers. • Research suggests that in some people, scleroderma symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain viruses, medicines or drugs. • Repeated exposure, such as at work, to certain harmful substances or chemicals also may increase the risk of scleroderma. • An environmental trigger is not identified for most people. • Immune system conditions. • Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease. • This means that it occurs in part because the body's immune system begins to attack the connective tissues. • People who have scleroderma also may have symptoms of another autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren syndrome. • Scleroderma complications range from mild to serious and can affect the: Fingertips. • In systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon can become so severe that the restricted blood flow permanently damages the tissue at the fingertips, causing pits or skin sores. • In some people, the tissue on the fingertips may die. • Lungs. • Scarring of lung tissue can impact the ability to breathe and tolerance for exercise. • High blood pressure in the arteries to the lungs also may happen. • Kidneys. • A serious kidney complication, called scleroderma renal crisis, involves a sudden increase in blood pressure and rapid kidney failure. • Prompt treatment of this condition is important to preserve kidney function. • Heart. • Scarring of heart tissue increases the risk of irregular heartbeats and heart failure. • Scleroderma also can cause inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart. • Teeth. • Serious tightening of facial skin can cause the mouth to become smaller and narrower. • This may make it hard to brush the teeth or to have them professionally cleaned or restored. • People who have scleroderma often don't make typical amounts of saliva, so the risk of dental decay increases even more. • Digestive system. • Digestive complications of scleroderma can include heartburn and difficulty swallowing. • Scleroderma also can cause bouts of cramps, bloating, constipation or diarrhea. • Some people who have scleroderma also may have problems absorbing nutrients due to overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine. • Joints. • The skin over joints can become so tight that it restricts flexibility and movement, particularly in the hands.",

      "Overview": "Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that most often is diagnosed in adolescents. • While scoliosis can occur in people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most childhood scoliosis is not known. • Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some curves worsen as children grow. • Severe scoliosis can be disabling. • An especially serious spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly. • Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. • In many cases, no treatment is necessary. • Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. • Others may need surgery to straighten more serious curves.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of scoliosis may include: Uneven shoulders. • One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other. • Uneven waist. • One hip higher than the other. • One side of the rib cage jutting forward. • A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward. • With most scoliosis cases, the spine will rotate or twist in addition to curving side to side. • This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick out farther than those on the other side. • Go to your health care provider if you notice signs of scoliosis in your child. • Mild curves can develop without you or your child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don't cause pain. • Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis. • Health care providers don't know what causes the most common type of scoliosis — although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder sometimes runs in families. • Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by: Certain neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. • Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine. • Previous surgery on the chest wall as a baby. • Injuries to or infections of the spine. • Spinal cord irregularities. • Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include: Age. • Signs and symptoms typically begin in adolescence. • Sex. • Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment. • Family history. • Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease. • While most people with scoliosis have a mild form of the disorder, scoliosis may sometimes cause complications, including: Breathing problems. • In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs, making it more difficult to breathe. • Back problems. • People who had scoliosis as children may be more likely to have chronic back pain as adults, especially if their curves are large and untreated. • Appearance. • As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes — including uneven hips and shoulders, prominent ribs, and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side. • People with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.",

      "Overview": "Scorpion stings are painful but rarely life-threatening. • Healthy adults usually don't need treatment for scorpion stings. • Young children and older adults are most at risk of serious complications. • Scorpions are arthropods — a relative of insects, spiders and crustaceans. • Bark scorpions — the only scorpion species in the U.S. with venom strong enough to cause serious symptoms — are generally about 1.6 to 3 inches (4 to 8 cm) long, including a segmented tail with a stinger that can deliver venom. • They're found mainly in the desert Southwest. • Worldwide, of more than 2,000 species of scorpions, about 100 produce venom serious enough to be fatal. • Scorpions have eight legs and a pair of lobster-like pinchers and a tail that curves up. • They're generally more active at night. • They usually won't sting unless provoked or attacked. • Most stings occur when they're accidentally grabbed or stepped on or brushed against the body.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms at the site of a scorpion sting may include: Pain, which can be intense. • Numbness and tingling. • Slight swelling. • Warmth. • Symptoms from venom that affect the whole body — usually in children who are stung — include: A hard time breathing. • Muscle twitching or thrashing. • Unusual head, neck and eye movements. • Drooling. • Sweating. • Slurred speech. • Nausea and vomiting. • High blood pressure (hypertension). • Fast heart rate (tachycardia). • Being restless or excitable, or crying in children that can't be comforted. • As with other stinging insects, such as bees and wasps, it is possible for people who have been stung by scorpions before to have allergic reactions when stung later. • Reactions to these later stings are sometimes serious enough to cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. • Symptoms in these cases are like those of anaphylaxis caused by bee stings, including hives, trouble breathing, and nausea and vomiting. • Contact your local poison control center at once if a child is stung by a scorpion. • To reach a poison control center in the U.S., call Poison Help at 800-222-1222. • Also, seek medical care if you've been stung and begin to have a hard time breathing or other symptoms that continue for more than a week. • If you're concerned about a scorpion sting, you also can call your local poison control center for advice.",
      "Causes": "A scorpion sting is caused by the stinger in a scorpion's tail. • When a scorpion stings, its stinger can release venom. • The venom contains a complex mix of toxins that affect the nervous system. • These are called neurotoxins.",
      "Risk factors": "Your risk of a scorpion sting rises if you: Live or travel where scorpions are. • In the U.S., scorpions mainly live in the desert Southwest, primarily Arizona, New Mexico and parts of California. • Worldwide, they're found most often in Mexico, North Africa, South America, the Middle East and India. • And you might bring them home with you. • That's because scorpions can hide in clothing, luggage and shipping containers. • Work, hike or camp where scorpions are. • Bark scorpions live under rocks and logs. • They also live under tree bark, which is how they get their name. • You're more likely to come into contact with one when you're working outside, hiking or camping.",
      "Complications": "The very old and the very young are most likely to die of untreated venomous scorpion stings. • The cause is usually heart or lung failure that occurs some hours after the sting. • Very few deaths from scorpion stings have been reported in the U.S. • Rarely, scorpion stings can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.",
      "Prevention": "Scorpions tend to avoid contact. • If you live in an area where scorpions are common, consider these steps to prevent chance meetings: Remove piles of rocks or lumber from around your house, and don't store firewood against the house or inside. • Keep grass closely mowed, and prune bushes and overhanging tree branches that can provide scorpions with a path to your roof. • Caulk cracks, install weatherstripping around doors and windows, and repair torn screens. • Inspect and shake out gardening gloves, clothing and boots that haven't been used for a while. • Take steps when you're traveling. • When you're in areas where deadly scorpions are common — especially if you're camping or staying in rustic accommodations — wear shoes. • Also, shake out your clothing, bedding, gear and packages often. • Scorpions glow under a black light, so you might want to use one at night to look at what's around you. • If you find a scorpion, use tongs to gently move it away from people."

      "Overview": "Scrotal masses are lumps or swelling in the scrotum, the bag of skin that holds the testicles. • Scrotal masses might be: A buildup of fluids. • The growth of irregular tissue. • Swollen, inflamed or hardened parts inside the scrotum. • It's key to get a scrotal mass checked by a health care professional, even if you don't have pain or other symptoms. • Some masses could be cancer. • Or they could be caused by another medical condition that affects the health of the testicles and how well they work. • Each month, check your scrotum for any changes. • Also get the area checked during regular health checkups. • This can help you spot masses early, when many treatments work better.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of scrotal masses vary. • Some cause pain and others don't. • It depends on the cause. • Symptoms of a scrotal mass might include: An unusual lump. • Sudden pain. • Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. • Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back. • A tender, swollen or hardened testicle or epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss). • The epididymis is the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm. • Swelling in the scrotum. • A change in color of the skin of the scrotum. • Upset stomach or vomiting. • If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include: Fever. • Needing to pee often. • Pus or blood in the urine. • Get emergency medical care if you have sudden pain in your scrotum. • Some problems need to be treated right away to help prevent permanent damage to a testicle. • See a health care professional if you notice a lump in your scrotum or other unusual changes. • Get a checkup even if you have a mass that isn't painful or tender. • Some scrotal masses are more common in children. • See your child's pediatrician or other health care professional if: Your child has symptoms of a scrotal mass. • You have any concerns about your child's genitals. • A testicle is \"missing.\" Sometimes, a testicle doesn't move down from the stomach area into the scrotum before birth. • This is called an undescended testicle. • It might raise the risk of some scrotal masses later in life. • Many health conditions can cause a scrotal mass or an unusual change in the scrotum. • These include: Testicular cancer. • This is cancer that starts in the testicles. • It often causes a painless lump or swelling in the scrotum. • But some people with testicular cancer don't have any symptoms. • See your doctor or other health care professional if you notice a new lump in your scrotum. • Spermatocele. • This fluid-filled sac in the scrotum is often above the testicle. • It tends to be painless. • And usually, it's not cancer. • A spermatocele also is known as a spermatic cyst or epididymal cyst. • Epididymitis. • This is when the coiled tube at the back of the testicle, called the epididymis, becomes inflamed. • Often, epididymitis is caused by an infection with bacteria. • For instance, bacterial infections that spread through sex, such as chlamydia, can cause it. • Less often, a virus can lead to epididymitis. • Orchitis. • This is when inflammation, which can include pain and swelling, affects the testicle. • Usually, it's due to an illness caused by a virus, most often mumps. • Hydrocele. • This is when extra fluid collects between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. • Most often, there's a small amount of fluid in this space. • But the excess fluid of a hydrocele can lead to a painless swelling of the scrotum. • In adults, a hydrocele can happen because of an imbalance in the amounts of fluid made or absorbed. • Often, this is due to an injury or infection in the scrotum. • In babies, a hydrocele tends to happen because an opening between the stomach area and the scrotum hasn't properly closed during development. • Hematocele. • This is a buildup of blood between the layers of a sac that surrounds each testicle. • An injury, such as a direct hit to the testicles, is the most likely cause. • Varicocele. • This happens when the veins inside the scrotum get bigger. • Varicocele is more common on the left side of the scrotum due to differences in how blood flows from each side. • A varicocele might cause infertility, which is when you can't get your partner pregnant after a year of unprotected sex. • Inguinal hernia. • This is when part of the small intestine pushes through an opening or weak spot in the tissue that separates the stomach area and groin. • It might appear as a mass in the scrotum or higher in the groin. • In infants, an inguinal hernia often happens before birth when the passageway from the stomach area to the scrotum doesn't close. • Testicular torsion. • This is a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle. • It happens due to a twisting of the spermatic cord. • That's a bundle of blood vessels, nerves and the tube that carries semen from the testicle to the penis. • Without prompt treatment, testicular torsion can lead to the loss of the testicle. • Things that can raise the risk of a scrotal mass include: Undescended testicle. • An undescended testicle doesn't leave the stomach area and move down into the scrotum before birth or in the months afterward. • Conditions present at birth. • Some people are born with irregular changes in the testicles, penis or kidneys. • These might raise the risk of a scrotal mass and testicular cancer later in life. • History of testicular cancer. • If you've had cancer in one testicle, your risk of getting cancer in the other testicle is higher. • Having a parent or a sibling who's had testicular cancer also raises your risk. • Not all scrotal masses lead to long-term medical conditions. • But any mass that affects the health or function of the testicle can result in: Delayed or poor development during puberty. • Infertility.",

      "Overview": "A seizure is a sudden burst of electrical activity in the brain. • It can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings and levels of consciousness. • Epilepsy is defined as having two or more seizures at least 24 hours apart that don't have a known cause. • But epilepsy doesn't cause all seizures. • There are many types of seizures. • They have a range of symptoms and vary in how much they affect your daily life. • Seizure types also vary by where they begin in the brain and how far they spread. • Most seizures last from 30 seconds to two minutes. • A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. • Seizures can happen after a stroke or a head injury. • An infection such as meningitis or another illness also may be the cause. • But often the cause is not known. • Medicine can manage most seizures, but they can have side effects. • Work with your healthcare professional to balance seizure management and medicine side effects.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary based on the type of seizure. • They also can range from mild to serious. • Seizure symptoms may include: Short-lived confusion. • A staring spell. • Jerking movements of the arms and legs that can't be stopped. • Loss of consciousness or awareness. • Changes in thinking or emotions. • These may include fear, anxiety or a feeling of already having lived the moment, called deja vu. • Most seizures fall into one of two classes called focal or generalized. • The classes are based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. • If health professionals don't know how the seizures began, they may say the seizures are of unknown onset. • Focal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain. • This type of seizure can happen with or without passing out, called losing consciousness. • Focal seizures with impaired awareness. • These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. • During these types of seizures, people may seem awake. • But they stare into space and don't respond to anything around them. • They may repeat movements such as hand rubbing and mouth movements, repeat certain words, or walk in circles. • They may not remember the seizure or even know that it happened. • Focal seizures without impaired awareness. • These seizures may change emotions. • They also may change how things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. • But people having a focal seizure don't pass out. • During these types of seizures, people may feel angry, joyful or sad. • Some people have nausea or odd feelings that are hard to describe. • These seizures may cause trouble speaking and jerking of a body part such as an arm or a leg. • They also may cause sudden symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. • Symptoms of focal seizures may seem like those of other conditions of the brain or nervous system. • These other conditions include migraine, mental illness or a condition that affects how the brain manages sleep-wake cycles, called narcolepsy. • Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. • Types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. • Absence seizures often happen in children. • These seizures once were called petit mal seizures. • People who have absence seizures most often stare into space or make slight body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. • The seizures most often last for 5 to 10 seconds. • Absence seizures can happen up to hundreds of times a day. • They can come in clusters. • And they can cause a brief loss of awareness. • Tonic seizures. • Tonic seizures cause muscles to get stiff. • These seizures most often affect muscles in the back, arms and legs. • People who have these seizures may pass out and fall to the ground. • Atonic seizures. • Atonic seizures cause a sudden loss of muscle use, most often in the legs. • They're also called drop seizures. • People having this type of seizure may collapse. • Clonic seizures. • Clonic seizures are linked with jerking muscle movements. • These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. • Myoclonic seizures. • Myoclonic seizures most often cause sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. • People who have these seizures don't often pass out. • Tonic-clonic seizures. • Tonic-clonic seizures are the most common type of generalized seizure. • They once were called grand mal seizures. • They can cause passing out, body stiffness and shaking. • They sometimes cause people to urinate or to bite their tongues. • Tonic-clonic seizures last for several minutes. • Tonic-clonic seizures may start as focal seizures that spread to involve most or all of the brain. • Seizures can have a beginning phase, a middle phase and an end phase. • These phases also are called prodrome, ictal and postictal. • Prodrome. • This is the earliest warning that a seizure may happen. • During the prodrome, people may have a hard-to-describe sense that a seizure may happen. • They also may have changes in behavior. • This can happen in the hours or even days before a seizure. • The prodrome stage may include an aura. • The aura is the first symptom of a seizure. • Symptoms during the aura may include the feeling that a person or place is familiar, called deja vu, or a feeling that a person or place is not familiar. • Or people may simply feel strange, feel fear or panic, or even have good feelings. • Symptoms also may include smells, sounds, tastes, blurred vision or racing thoughts. • Most often, auras are feelings that are hard to describe. • The prodrome may include headache, numbness, tingling, nausea or dizziness. • Many people with seizures have a prodrome or aura. • But some people do not. • Ictal phase. • The ictal phase lasts from the first symptom, including the aura, to the end of the seizure. • Symptoms of the ictal phase depend on the type of seizure. • Postictal phase. • This is the period after a seizure during recovery. • The postictal stage can last minutes or hours. • Some people recover quickly, while others take hours. • The length of the postictal phase depends on the type of seizure and what part of the brain was affected. • During this phase, people may be slow to respond, have trouble with memory, and have trouble talking or writing. • They may feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, sad, scared, anxious or frustrated. • They also may have nausea, a headache or weakness. • They may feel thirsty or urinate. • Seek medical help right away if you have a seizure or if you see someone have a seizure and any of the following happens: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. • The person isn't breathing after the seizure stops. • A second seizure follows right away. • The person has a high fever. • The person's body overheats, called heat exhaustion. • The person is pregnant. • The person has diabetes. • The seizure causes an injury. • The seizure happens in water. • The first time you have a seizure, see a healthcare professional. • Seizures are caused by changes in the way nerve cells in the brain communicate. • Nerve cells in the brain create, send and receive electrical impulses. • The nerve cells are called neurons. • The impulses allow the cells to communicate. • Anything that gets in way of the communication pathways can lead to a seizure. • Gene changes cause some types of seizures. • Epilepsy is a common cause of seizures. • But not everyone who has a seizure has epilepsy. • Sometimes the following can cause seizures: A high fever. • When fever causes a seizure, it's called a febrile seizure. • An infection of the brain. • This may include meningitis or encephalitis. • Serious illness. • This includes serious illness with COVID-19. • Lack of sleep. • Low blood sodium. • This can happen if you take medicine that makes you urinate. • Certain medicines that treat pain or depression or help people stop smoking. • A new, active brain injury, such as head trauma. • It can cause bleeding in an area of the brain or a stroke. • The use of drugs that are sold on the streets. • This includes amphetamines and cocaine. • Alcohol misuse. • Seizures can happen from withdrawal from alcohol or from drinking too much alcohol. • The following increase the risk of having a seizure: Head or brain injuries. • Cognitive issues. • Stroke. • Alzheimer's disease. • Brain tumors. • Alcohol or illicit drug misuse. • Family history of seizures. • Having a seizure can sometimes lead to complications that can cause danger for you or others. • You might be at risk of: Falling. • If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. • Drowning. • If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you're at risk of drowning. • Car accidents. • A seizure can cause loss of awareness or not being able to control a vehicle while driving. • Pregnancy complications. • Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to pregnant people and their babies. • And certain antiseizure medicines increase the risk of health conditions present at birth. • If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, work with your healthcare professional to check to see if your medicines need to be adjusted during pregnancy. • Mental health conditions. • People with seizures are more likely to have depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions. • This can be from dealing with seizures or from the side effects of antiseizure medicines. • Sudden, unexpected death. • Rarely, a single seizure causes death. • This is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). • Seizures that aren't managed well and other factors play a role in the risk of SUDEP. • But experts don't know the overall risks or the cause. • Good treatment of seizures is vital in preventing SUDEP. • People who have more than one seizure should stay away from things that can cause a seizure, such as: Not sleeping enough. • Using alcohol or illicit drugs. • Stress. • Being around flashing lights.",

      "Overview": "Selective IgA deficiency is the lack of a disease-fighting antibody in the immune system called immunoglobulin A (IgA). • People with this condition usually have typical levels of other immunoglobulins (im-u-no-GLOB-u-lins). • An immunoglobulin is an antibody produced by immune system cells to fight bacteria, parasites and other agents that cause illness. • IgA antibodies circulate in the blood and are found in tears, saliva, breast milk, and fluids released from the lining of the airways, lungs and digestive system. • Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. • But some people who have selective IgA deficiency have frequent illness of the airways, lungs and digestive system. • Selective IgA deficiency may increase the risk of other conditions related to the immune system, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and others. • There is no treatment specifically for selective IgA deficiency. • Treatments focus on addressing the frequent, repeat or long-lasting conditions that develop with this immune system disorder.",
      "Symptoms": "Most people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms. • Some people have illnesses more often than is typical. • They also may have a particular illness that returns often. • Having frequent illnesses doesn't necessarily mean a person has selective IgA deficiency. • People with selective IgA deficiency may have frequent or repeat episodes of the following: Ear infections, particularly in young children. • Colds. • Sinus infections. • Lung illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. • Giardiasis, a parasitic illness of the digestive system that causes diarrhea. • Children with frequent illnesses may not eat well or may not gain weight typical for their age.",
      "Causes": "Selective IgA deficiency happens when immune system cells don't produce any or produce very few IgA antibodies. • The exact reason cells don't produce these antibodies isn't known. • Certain medicines used to treat seizures, epilepsy or rheumatoid arthritis may cause selective IgA deficiency in some people. • The deficiency may continue after the medicine is no longer taken.",
      "Risk factors": "A family history of selective IgA deficiency increases the risk of the condition. • Certain variations of genes appear to be linked to selective IgA deficiency, but no gene is known to directly cause the condition.",
      "Complications": "People with selective IgA deficiency are at increased risk of other long-term conditions. • These include: Allergies and asthma. • Rheumatoid arthritis. • Celiac disease. • Inflammatory bowel disease. • Common variable immunodeficiency, which is a lack of two or more types of immunoglobulins. • People with selective IgA deficiency are at risk of reactions to blood transfusions or blood products. • Because a person's body doesn't make IgA, the immune system may see it as a foreign substance in a blood transfusion or other treatment with blood products. • A reaction may cause high fever, chills, sweating and other symptoms. • Rarely, people with selective IgA deficiency have a life-threatening allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis (an-uh-fuh-LAK-sis). • Healthcare professionals recommend wearing a medical bracelet. • A bracelet can show that you have selective IgA deficiency and should receive modified blood or blood products."

      "Overview": "Nonsuicidal self-injury, often simply called self-injury, is the act of harming your own body on purpose, such as by cutting or burning yourself. • It's usually not meant as a suicide attempt. • This type of self-injury is a harmful way to cope with emotional pain, sadness, anger and stress. • While self-injury may bring a brief sense of calm and a release of physical and emotional tension, it's usually followed by guilt and shame and the return of painful emotions. • Life-threatening injuries are usually not intended, but it's possible that more-serious and even fatal self-harm could happen. • Getting the proper treatment can help you learn healthier ways to cope.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of self-injury may include: Scars, often in patterns. • Fresh cuts, scratches, bruises, bite marks or other wounds. • Excessive rubbing of an area to create a burn. • Keeping sharp objects or other items used for self-injury on hand. • Wearing long sleeves or long pants to hide self-injury, even in hot weather. • Frequent reports of accidental injury. • Difficulties in relationships with others. • Behaviors and emotions that change quickly and are impulsive, intense and unexpected. • Talk of helplessness, hopelessness or worthlessness. • Self-injury mostly happens in private. • Usually, it's done in a controlled manner or the same way each time, which often leaves a pattern on the skin. • Examples of self-harm include: Cutting, scratching or stabbing with a sharp object, one of the most common methods. • Burning with lit matches, cigarettes or heated, sharp objects such as knives. • Carving words or symbols on the skin. • Self-hitting, punching, biting or head banging. • Piercing the skin with sharp objects. • Inserting objects under the skin. • Most frequently, the arms, legs, chest and belly are the targets of self-injury. • But any area of the body may be a target, sometimes using more than one method. • Becoming upset can trigger urges to self-injure. • Many people self-injure only a few times and then stop. • But for others, self-injury can become a longer term, repeated behavior. • If you're injuring yourself, even in a minor way, or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, reach out for help. • Any form of self-injury is a sign of bigger stressors that need attention. • Talk to someone you trust — such as a friend, family member, health care provider, spiritual leader, or a school counselor, nurse or teacher. • They can help you take the first steps to successful treatment. • While you may feel ashamed and embarrassed about your behavior, you can find supportive, caring help from people who aren't going to judge you. • If you have a friend or family member who is self-injuring, you may be shocked and scared. • Take all talk of self-injury seriously. • Although you might feel that you'd be betraying a confidence, self-injury is too big a problem to ignore or to deal with alone. • Here are some ways to help. • Your child. • You can start by talking with your pediatrician or other health care provider who can do an initial evaluation or make a referral to a mental health professional. • Express your concern, but don't yell at your child or make threats or accusations. • Preteen or teenage friend. • Suggest that your friend talk to parents, a teacher, a school counselor or another trusted adult. • Adult. • Gently express your concern and encourage the person to seek medical and mental health treatment If you've injured yourself severely or believe your injury may be life-threatening, or if you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. • Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health provider if you're seeing one. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • Seek help from your school nurse or counselor, teacher, or health care provider. • Reach out to a close friend or family member. • Contact a spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.",
      "Causes": "There's no one single or simple cause that leads someone to self-injure. • In general, self-injury may result from: Poor coping skills. • Nonsuicidal self-injury is usually the result of an inability to cope in healthy ways with stress and emotional pain. • Difficulty managing emotions. • Having a hard time controlling, expressing or understanding emotions may lead to self-injury. • The mix of emotions that triggers self-injury is complex. • For example, there may be feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, panic, anger, guilt, rejection and self-hatred. • Being bullied or having questions about sexual identity may be part of the mix of emotions. • Self-injury may be an attempt to: Manage or reduce severe distress or anxiety and provide a sense of relief. • Provide a distraction from painful emotions through physical pain. • Feel a sense of control over the body, feelings or life situations. • Feel something — anything — even if it's physical pain, when feeling emotionally empty. • Express internal feelings in an external way. • Communicate feelings of stress or depression to the outside world. • Punish oneself.",
      "Risk factors": "Teenagers and young adults are most likely to self-injure, but those in other age groups do it, too. • Self-injury often starts in the preteen or early teen years, when emotional changes happen fast, often and unexpectedly. • During this time, teens also face increasing peer pressure, loneliness, and conflicts with parents or other authority figures. • Certain factors may increase the risk of self-injury, including: Having friends who self-injure. • Having friends who intentionally harm themselves makes it more likely for someone to begin self-injuring. • Life issues. • Past experiences of neglect, sexual, physical or emotional abuse, or other traumatic events may increase the risk of self-injury. • So can growing up and remaining in an unstable family environment. • Other risk factors include questioning personal or sexual identity and social isolation. • Mental health issues. • Being highly self-critical and struggling with problem solving increases the risk of self-injury. • Also, self-injury is commonly linked with certain mental health conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. • Alcohol or drug use. • Being under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs may increase the risk of self-injury.",
      "Complications": "Self-injury can cause complications, such as: Worsening feelings of shame, guilt and low self-esteem. • Infection, either from wounds or from sharing tools. • Permanent scars or other permanent harm to the body. • Worsening of underlying issues and conditions, if not properly treated. • Severe injury that could possibly lead to death. • Self-injury is not usually a suicide attempt, but it can increase the risk of suicide because of the emotional problems that trigger self-injury. • And the pattern of damaging the body in times of distress can make suicide more likely.",
      "Prevention": "There is no sure way to prevent someone's self-injuring behavior. • But reducing the risk of self-injury includes strategies that involve both individuals and communities. • Parents, family members, teachers, school nurses, coaches or friends can help. • Identify someone at risk and offer help. • Someone at risk can be taught how to better manage stress and deal with life's problems. • The person can learn healthy coping skills to use during periods of distress. • Encourage supportive social networks. • Feeling lonely and disconnected may be a part of self-injury. • Helping someone form healthy connections to people who don't self-injure can improve relationship and communication skills. • Raise awareness. • Learn about the warning signs of self-injury and what to do when you suspect it. • Encourage friends to seek help. • Peers tend to be loyal to their friends. • Encourage children, teens and young adults to avoid secrecy and reach out for help if they have a concern about a friend or family member. • Talk about media influence. • News media, music and other highly visible outlets that feature self-injury may nudge children and young adults with mental or emotional issues to experiment. • Teaching children critical thinking skills about the influences around them might reduce the harmful impact."

      "Overview": "Separation anxiety is a typical phase for many infants and toddlers. • Young children often have a period where they get anxious or distressed when they have to separate from their parent or main caregivers. • Examples of this can be tears at daycare drop-off or getting fussy when a new person holds them. • This usually starts to improve by about 2 to 3 years of age. • In some children, intense and ongoing separation anxiety is a sign of a more serious condition known as separation anxiety disorder. • Separation anxiety disorder can be identified as early as preschool age. • Your child may have separation anxiety disorder if separation anxiety seems more intense than other kids of the same age or lasts a longer time, interferes with school or other daily activities, or includes panic attacks or other problem behaviors. • Most often, separation anxiety relates to the child's anxiety about being away from parents or guardians, but it could relate to another close caregiver. • Less often, separation anxiety disorder can occur in teenagers and adults. • This can cause major problems leaving home or going to work. • Treatment can lessen separation anxiety disorder symptoms. • Treatment may include specific types of therapy, sometimes along with medicine.",
      "Symptoms": "Separation anxiety disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are much more than expected for someone's developmental age and cause major distress or problems doing daily activities. • Symptoms may include: Repeated and intense distress when thinking about separation or when away from home or loved ones. • This may include being clingy or having tantrums about separation that last longer or are more severe than other kids of the same age. • Constant, intense worry about losing a parent or other loved one to an illness, death, or a disaster or harm coming to them. • Constant worry that something bad will happen, such as being lost or kidnapped, causing separation from parents or other loved ones. • Not wanting to or refusing to be away from home because of fear of separation. • Not wanting to be home alone or somewhere without a parent or other loved one close by, if the child has reached an age where being alone might be expected. • Not wanting to or refusing to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without a parent or other loved one nearby, if the child has reached an age where these activities might be expected. • Repeated nightmares about separation. • Repeated complaints of headaches, stomachaches, or other symptoms during or before separation from a parent or other loved one. • Separation anxiety disorder may occur along with panic attacks. • Panic attacks are repeated bouts of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes. • Separation anxiety disorder usually won't go away without treatment and can lead to panic disorder and other anxiety disorders into adulthood. • If you have concerns about your child's separation anxiety, talk to your child's pediatrician or other healthcare professional.",
      "Causes": "Sometimes, separation anxiety can be triggered by life stress that results in separation from a loved one. • Examples include divorce of parents, changing schools, moving to a new location or a loved one's death. • Genetics may play a role in separation anxiety becoming separation anxiety disorder.",
      "Risk factors": "Separation anxiety disorder most often begins in childhood. • But it may continue into the teenage years and sometimes into adulthood. • Risk factors may include: Life stresses or loss that result in separation. • Examples include the illness or death of a loved one, loss of a beloved pet, divorce of parents, or moving or going away to school. • Family history. • Having blood relatives who have anxiety symptoms or an anxiety disorder may increase the risk of having separation anxiety disorder. • Situational issues. • Experiencing some type of disaster or traumatic life event may increase the risk of separation anxiety disorder.",
      "Complications": "Separation anxiety disorder causes major distress and problems functioning at home, in social situations, or at work or school. • Disorders that can occur along with separation anxiety disorder include: Other anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, phobias, social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia. • Obsessive-compulsive disorder. • Depression.",
      "Prevention": "There's no sure way to prevent separation anxiety disorder in your child, but these suggestions may help. • Get professional advice as soon as possible if you're concerned that your child's anxiety is much worse than others at the same developmental stage. • Early diagnosis and treatment can help lessen anxiety symptoms and keep the condition from getting worse. • Follow the treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. • Get your own evidence-based treatment and support if you have anxiety, depression or other mental health concerns, so that you can model healthy coping skills for your child."

      "Symptoms": "STDs can have a range of symptoms, including no symptoms. • That's why sexually transmitted infections may go unnoticed until a person has complications or a partner is diagnosed. • STI symptoms might include: Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area. • Painful or burning urination. • Discharge from the penis. • Unusual or odorous vaginal discharge. • Unusual vaginal bleeding. • Pain during sex. • Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread. • Lower abdominal pain. • Fever. • Rash over the trunk, hands or feet. • Sexually transmitted infection symptoms may appear a few days after exposure. • But it may take years before you have any noticeable problems, depending on what's causing the STI. • See a health care professional immediately if: You are sexually active and may have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. • You have symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection. • Make an appointment with a health care professional: When you're considering becoming sexually active or by age 21, whichever comes first. • Before you start having sex with a new partner. • Sexually transmitted infections can be caused by: Bacteria. • Gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are examples of STDs that are caused by bacteria. • Parasites. • Trichomoniasis is an STD caused by a parasite. • Viruses. • STDs caused by viruses include human papillomavirus (HPV), the herpes simplex virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. • Anyone who is sexually active risks getting or spreading an STD. • Factors that may increase the risk of getting an sexually transmitted infection include: Having unprotected sex. • Vaginal or anal sex with an infected partner who isn't wearing a condom (latex or polyurethane) greatly increases the risk of getting an STD. • Condoms made from natural membranes aren't recommended because they're not effective at preventing some STIs. • Not using condoms properly or not using them each time also can increase risk. • Oral sex may be less risky. • But sexually transmitted infections can still spread if a person doesn't use a condom (latex or polyurethane) or a dental dam. • That is a thin, square piece of rubber made with latex or silicone. • Having sexual contact with many partners. • The more people you have sexual activity with, the greater your risk. • Having a history of STIs. • Having one sexually transmitted infection makes it much easier for another STI to take hold. • Being forced to engage in sexual activity. • See a health care professional as soon as possible to get screening, treatment and emotional support. • Misuse of alcohol or use of recreational drugs. • Substance misuse can inhibit your judgment, making you more willing to take part in risky behaviors. • Injecting drugs. • Sharing a needle while injecting drugs can spread many serious infections. • Examples are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C. • Being young. • People age 15 to 24 report high levels of STIs compared to those who are older. • During pregnancy or delivery, some sexually transmitted infections can be passed from mother to infant. • Examples are gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV and syphilis. • STIs in infants can cause serious problems or even death. • All pregnant women should be screened for STI infections and treated as needed. • Many people in the early stages of an STD have no symptoms. • That's why screening is important to prevent complications. • Possible complications of sexually transmitted infections include: Pelvic pain. • Pregnancy complications. • Eye inflammation. • Arthritis. • Pelvic inflammatory disease. • Infertility. • Heart disease. • Certain cancers, such as HPV-associated cervical and rectal cancers. • There are many ways to avoid or lower your risk of getting an STD. • Avoid sex or sexual activity. • The most effective way to avoid STDs is to not have sex. • Stay with one uninfected partner. • Staying in a long-term relationship in which both people have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected can be one way to avoid an STD. • Wait and test. • Avoid vaginal and anal sex or sexual activity with new partners until you have both been tested for sexually transmitted infections. • Oral sex may be less risky. • But STIs can still spread if a person doesn't use a condom (latex or polyurethane) or a dental dam. • These barriers prevent skin-to-skin contact between the oral and genital mucous membranes. • Get vaccinated. • Getting vaccinated before having sex can prevent certain types of sexually transmitted infections. • Vaccines are available to prevent STDs caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A and hepatitis B. • Use condoms and dental dams consistently and correctly. • Use a new latex or polyurethane condom or dental dam for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. • Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, with a latex condom or dental dam. • Also, these types of barriers give less protection for STDs involving exposed genital sores, such as HPV or herpes. • Nonbarrier forms of contraception, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs), don't protect against STIs. • Don't drink alcohol excessively or use illegal drugs. • If you're under the influence of these substances, you're more likely to take sexual risks. • Talk to your partner. • Before any sexual contact, talk to your partner about practicing safer sex. • Be sure you clearly agree on what activities will and won't be OK. • Think about male circumcision. • For men, evidence has found that circumcision can help lower the risk of getting HIV from a woman with HIV by as much as 60%. • Male circumcision may also help prevent spread of genital HPV and genital herpes. • Think about using preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). • The U.S. • Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two combination medicines to lower the risk of HIV infection in people who are at very high risk. • The medicines are emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). • These medicines must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. • Your health care professional will prescribe these medicines for HIV prevention only if you don't already have HIV. • You'll need an HIV test before you start taking PrEP and then every three months as long as you're taking it. • Your health care professional also will test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada. • They will then test your kidney function every six months. • If you have hepatitis B, see an infectious disease specialist or liver specialist before starting therapy. • According to the CDC, if you use Truvada daily, you can lower your risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%. • And you can lower your risk of getting HIV from injection drug use by more than 74%. • Research suggests that Descovy is also effective in lowering the risk of getting HIV from sex. • But Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex. • Using added prevention, such as condoms, can lower your risk even more and prevent other STIs.",

      "Overview": "Shaken baby syndrome is a serious brain injury that results from forcefully shaking an infant or a toddler. • It also is known as abusive head trauma, shaken impact syndrome, inflicted head injury or whiplash shaken infant syndrome. • Shaken baby syndrome can damage or destroy a child's brain cells. • This form of child abuse can cause permanent brain damage or death. • Shaken baby syndrome is preventable. • Help is available for parents who are at risk of harming a child. • Parents also can teach other caregivers about the dangers of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of shaken baby syndrome may include: Extreme fussiness or irritability. • Difficulty staying awake. • Breathing problems. • Poor eating. • Vomiting. • Pale or discolored skin. • Seizures. • Paralysis. • Coma. • While sometimes a child may have bruising on the face, you may not see signs of physical injury to the child's outer body. • Injuries that might not be seen immediately include: Bleeding in the brain and eyes. • Spinal cord damage. • Fractures of the ribs, skull, legs and other bones. • Children with shaken baby syndrome often show symptoms of prior child abuse. • In mild cases of shaken baby syndrome, children may appear OK after being shaken. • But they may develop health or behavioral problems over time. • Seek help right away if you suspect your child has been injured by violent shaking. • Call 911 or your local emergency number or take your child to the nearest emergency room. • Getting medical care right away may save your child's life or prevent serious health problems. • Healthcare professionals are legally required to report all suspected cases of child abuse to state authorities.",
      "Causes": "Babies have weak neck muscles and can't support the weight of their heads. • If a baby is forcefully shaken, their brain moves back and forth inside the skull. • This causes bruising, swelling and bleeding. • Shaken baby syndrome usually occurs when a parent or caregiver severely shakes a baby or toddler due to frustration or anger. • It often happens because the child won't stop crying. • Shaken baby syndrome is not caused by bouncing a child on your knee or minor falls.",
      "Risk factors": "These things may increase the risk that parents or caregivers might forcefully shake a baby and cause shaken baby syndrome: Having unrealistic expectations of babies. • Having a baby that cries uncontrollably. • Having a baby born prematurely or with medical needs. • Being a young or single parent. • Stress. • Domestic violence. • Alcohol or substance misuse. • Unstable family situations. • Depression. • A history of mistreatment as a child. • Also, men are more likely to severely shake a baby hard enough to cause shaken baby syndrome than women are.",
      "Complications": "Even brief shaking of an infant can cause brain damage that can't be reversed. • Many children affected by shaken baby syndrome die. • Children who survive shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care for conditions such as: Partial or total blindness. • Delayed development. • Troubles with learning and behavior. • Seizures or epilepsy. • Cerebral palsy, a disorder that affects movement and muscle coordination.",
      "Prevention": "New parent education classes can help parents better understand the dangers of violent shaking. • The classes also may provide tips to soothe a crying baby and manage stress. • When your crying baby can't be calmed, you may be tempted to try anything to get the tears to stop. • But it's important to always treat your child gently. • Nothing justifies shaking a child. • If you're having trouble managing your emotions or the stress of parenthood, seek help. • Your child's healthcare professional may offer a referral to a counselor or other mental health professional. • If other people help take care of your child, make sure they know the dangers of shaken baby syndrome. • These people might include a hired caregiver, sibling or grandparent."

      "Overview": "Shellfish allergy is an atypical response by the body's immune system to proteins in certain marine animals. • Marine animals in the shellfish category include crustaceans and mollusks. • Examples are shrimp, crabs, lobster, squid, oysters, scallops and snails. • Shellfish is a common food allergy. • Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. • Reactions range from mild symptoms — such as hives or a stuffy nose — to severe and even life-threatening. • If you think you have shellfish allergy, talk to your health care provider. • Tests can help confirm the allergy so you can take steps to avoid future reactions.",
      "Symptoms": "Shellfish allergy symptoms generally start within minutes to an hour after eating or having contact with shellfish. • They may include: Hives Itchy, irritated skin Nasal stuffiness (congestion) Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the body Wheezing or trouble breathing Coughing and choking or a tight feeling in the throat Belly (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting Allergies can cause a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. • It can occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to something you're allergic to — and worsens quickly. • An anaphylactic reaction to shellfish is a medical emergency. • Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection and a follow-up trip to the emergency room. • If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal. • Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. • Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: A swollen throat or tongue or a tightness in the throat (airway constriction) that makes it difficult for you to breathe Coughing, choking or wheezing with trouble breathing Shock, with a severe drop in your blood pressure and a rapid or weak pulse Severe skin rash, hives, itching or swelling Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting Seek emergency treatment if you develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis. • See a health care provider or allergy specialist if you have food allergy symptoms shortly after eating.",
      "Causes": "All food allergies are caused by an immune system overreaction. • Your immune system identifies a harmless substance as being harmful. • This substance is called an allergen. • In shellfish allergy, your immune system mistakenly identifies a certain protein in shellfish as harmful. • Your immune system is how your body protects itself, so it produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against this allergen. • The next time you come in contact with the shellfish protein, these antibodies signal your immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into your bloodstream. • This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. • There are several types of shellfish, each containing different proteins: Crustaceans include crabs, lobster, crayfish, shrimp and prawn Mollusks include squid, octopus, mussels, snails, clams, oysters, abalone and scallops An allergy to crustaceans is the most common type. • Some people are allergic to only one type of shellfish but can eat others. • Other people with shellfish allergy must avoid all shellfish. • An allergy to fish — such as salmon, tuna or catfish — is a different seafood allergy from an allergy to shellfish. • Some people who are allergic to shellfish may still be able to eat fish, or they could be allergic to both. • Your health care provider can help you determine what is safe to eat.",
      "Risk factors": "You're at increased risk of developing shellfish allergy if allergies of any type are common in your family. • Though people of any age can develop shellfish allergy, it's more common in adults. • In fact, shellfish allergy is the most common food allergy in adults. • Among adults, shellfish allergy is more common in women. • Among children, shellfish allergy is more common in boys.",
      "Complications": "In severe cases, shellfish allergy can lead to anaphylaxis, a dangerous allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. • When you have shellfish allergy, you may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis if you have: Asthma Allergic reactions to very small amounts of shellfish (extreme sensitivity) History of food-induced anaphylaxis Strong family history of allergy Anaphylaxis is treated with an emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline). • If you are at risk of having a severe allergic reaction to shellfish, you always should carry injectable epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others).",
      "Prevention": "If you have shellfish allergy, the only way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid all shellfish and products that contain shellfish. • Even trace amounts of shellfish can cause a severe reaction in some people. • Be cautious when dining out. • When dining at restaurants, always check to make sure that the pan, oil or utensils used for shellfish aren't also used to prepare other foods, creating cross-contamination. • It might be necessary to avoid eating at seafood restaurants, where there's a high risk of cross-contamination. • Read labels. • Cross-contamination can occur in stores where other food is processed or displayed near shellfish and during manufacturing. • Shellfish may be in fish stock or seafood flavoring. • Read food labels carefully. • Shellfish is not usually a hidden ingredient. • Companies are required to label any product that contains crustacean shellfish or certain other foods that often cause allergic reactions. • However, these regulations don't apply to mollusks. • Keep your distance. • You may need to completely avoid places where shellfish are prepared or processed. • Some people react after touching shellfish or inhaling steam from cooking shellfish. • If you have shellfish allergy, talk with your health care provider about carrying emergency epinephrine and how to use it. • Consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace that lets others know you have a food allergy. • One thing you don't need to worry about is if you'll also be allergic to iodine or radiocontrast material that's used in some imaging tests. • Even though shellfish contain small amounts of iodine, shellfish allergy is unrelated to the reactions some people have to radiocontrast material or iodine."

      "Overview": "Shigella infection is an illness that affects the intestine. • Another name for it is shigellosis. • It's caused by a group of germs called shigella bacteria. • Children under age 5 are most likely to get shigella infection. • But the illness can happen at any age. • The germs that cause it spread easily through an infected person's stool. • The germs can get on fingers, on surfaces, or into food or water. • Infection happens after the germs are swallowed. • The main symptom of shigella infection is diarrhea that can be bloody or long lasting. • Other symptoms can include fever and stomach pain. • Most often, shigella infection clears up on its own within a week. • Treatment for serious illness may include medicines called antibiotics that get rid of the germs. • Help prevent shigella infection by washing hands often, especially after changing a diaper or using the bathroom. • And if you swim in ponds, lakes or swimming pools, try not to swallow the water.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of shigella infection usually start a day or two after contact with the germs that cause it. • Sometimes, the illness takes up to a week to start. • Symptoms can include: Diarrhea that may contain blood or mucus, and that may last more than three days. • Stomach pain or cramps. • A feeling of needing to pass stool even when the bowel is empty. • Fever. • Upset stomach or vomiting. • Symptoms tend to last up to seven days. • Sometimes they last longer. • Some people have no symptoms after they've been infected with shigella. • But the germs may be able to spread through the stool for up to a few weeks. • Call your healthcare professional or seek urgent care if you or your child has: Bloody diarrhea. • Diarrhea that causes weight loss and dehydration. • Diarrhea along with a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) or higher. • Terrible stomach cramps or tenderness. • Frequent vomiting that prevents you from keeping down liquids. • Dehydration symptoms such as little or no urination, very dry mouth and throat, or a feeling of dizziness when standing. • If you have a weakened immune system, call your healthcare professional if you have any shigella infection symptoms. • The illness is more likely to make you sick for a longer time. • Shigella infection is caused by swallowing shigella bacteria. • This can happen when you: Touch your mouth. • This poses a risk because there are many ways for shigella germs to get on your hands. • You might change the diaper of a child who has shigella infection. • Or you might touch an object that has germs on it, such as a toy or changing table. • The germs also can spread from hand to mouth during sexual contact with someone who has the infection. • Eat tainted food. • A person with a shigella infection who handles food can spread the germs to people who eat the food. • Food also can become tainted if it grows in a field that contains sewage. • Swallow tainted water. • Water can become tainted with shigella germs from sewage. • Water also can become tainted if a person with shigella infection swims in it. • Risk factors for shigella infection include the following: Being a child. • Children under age 5 are most likely to get shigella infection. • But people of any age can get the illness. • Living in group housing or doing group activities. • Close contact with other people can spread the germs from person to person. • Shigella outbreaks are more common in child care centers, schools, public pools, water parks and nursing homes. • Living or traveling in areas that lack clean water and sewage disposal services. • People who live or travel in developing countries are more likely to get shigella infection. • Sexual contact that involves the anus. • Shigella germs can spread from the stool or soiled fingers of one partner to the mouth of another partner. • This puts men who have sex with men at higher risk of shigella infection. • Experiencing homelessness. • This may involve staying in crowded areas or having less access to clean water and toilets. • That can raise the risk of infection when shigella germs are spread through the community. • Having a weakened immune system. • This raises the risk of more-serious shigella infection. • The immune system may be weakened from health conditions such as HIV or from treatments such as chemotherapy. • It may take weeks or months before you return to your typical bowel habits. • And most often, shigella infection clears up without leading to other health conditions called complications. • Constant diarrhea can cause dehydration. • Symptoms include dizziness, lack of tears in children, sunken eyes and dry diapers. • Serious dehydration can lead to shock and death. • Some children with shigella infections have seizures. • Seizures can cause changes in behavior, jerking movements and loss of consciousness. • They are more common in children who have high fevers. • But they also can happen in children who do not have high fevers. • It's not known whether the seizures are a result of the fever or the shigella infection itself. • If your child appears to have a seizure, call your healthcare professional right away. • This condition happens when part of the large intestine's lowest section slips outside the anus. • It may be more common in children with shigella who don't get enough nutrition. • This rare complication of shigella affects the blood and blood vessels. • It can lead to kidney failure. • This rare complication prevents the colon from passing stool and gas. • The colon becomes bigger as a result. • Symptoms include stomach pain and swelling, fever, and weakness. • Without treatment, the colon may burst. • This causes a life-threatening infection called peritonitis that needs emergency surgery. • This condition can happen weeks after shigella infection. • Symptoms include joint pain and swelling, usually in the ankles, knees, feet and hips. • Other symptoms can include painful urination and redness, itching, and discharge in one or both eyes. • This also is known as bacteremia. • Shigella infection can damage the lining of the intestines. • Rarely, shigella germs enter the blood through the damaged lining and cause a bloodstream infection. • These infections are more common in adults with weakened immune systems and in children. • Take the following steps to help prevent shigella infection: Wash hands often. • Use soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds. • This is key before you prepare or eat food, and before sexual activity. • It's also important to wash after you use the bathroom or change a diaper. • Throw away soiled diapers in a covered, lined garbage can. • Disinfect diaper-changing areas right after use, especially if the diaper leaks or spills. • Try not to swallow water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. • Do not have sexual contact with anyone who has diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea. • Wait at least two weeks. • If you or your child has diarrhea or a known shigella infection, take these steps to prevent spreading germs: Keep washing hands often. • And watch small children when they wash their hands. • Don't prepare food for others if possible. • Stay home from healthcare, food service or child care jobs while sick. • Keep children with diarrhea home from child care, play groups or school. • Don't go swimming until you have fully recovered.",

      "Prevention": "Take the following steps to help prevent shigella infection: Wash hands often. • Use soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds. • This is key before you prepare or eat food, and before sexual activity. • It's also important to wash after you use the bathroom or change a diaper. • Throw away soiled diapers in a covered, lined garbage can. • Disinfect diaper-changing areas right after use, especially if the diaper leaks or spills. • Try not to swallow water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. • Do not have sexual contact with anyone who has diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea. • Wait at least two weeks. • If you or your child has diarrhea or a known shigella infection, take these steps to prevent spreading germs: Keep washing hands often. • And watch small children when they wash their hands. • Don't prepare food for others if possible. • Stay home from healthcare, food service or child care jobs while sick. • Keep children with diarrhea home from child care, play groups or school. • Don't go swimming until you have fully recovered."

      "Overview": "Sjogren's (SHOW-grins) syndrome is a disorder of your immune system identified by its two most common symptoms — dry eyes and a dry mouth. • The condition often accompanies other immune system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. • In Sjogren's syndrome, the mucous membranes and moisture-secreting glands of your eyes and mouth are usually affected first — resulting in decreased tears and saliva. • Although you can develop Sjogren's syndrome at any age, most people are older than 40 at the time of diagnosis. • The condition is much more common in women. • Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "The two main symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome are: Dry eyes. • Your eyes might burn, itch or feel gritty — as if there's sand in them. • Dry mouth. • Your mouth might feel like it's full of cotton, making it difficult to swallow or speak. • Some people with Sjogren's syndrome also have one or more of the following: Joint pain, swelling and stiffness Swollen salivary glands — particularly the set located behind your jaw and in front of your ears Skin rashes or dry skin Vaginal dryness Persistent dry cough Prolonged fatigue Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. • Your immune system mistakenly attacks your body's own cells and tissues. • Scientists aren't certain why some people develop Sjogren's syndrome. • Certain genes put people at higher risk of the disorder, but it appears that a triggering mechanism — such as infection with a particular virus or strain of bacteria — is also necessary. • In Sjogren's syndrome, your immune system first targets the glands that make tears and saliva. • But it can also damage other parts of your body, such as: Joints Thyroid Kidneys Liver Lungs Skin Nerves Sjogren's syndrome typically occurs in people with one or more known risk factors, including: Age. • Sjogren's syndrome is usually diagnosed in people older than 40. • Sex. • Women are much more likely to have Sjogren's syndrome. • Rheumatic disease. • It's common for people who have Sjogren's syndrome to also have a rheumatic disease — such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. • The most common complications of Sjogren's syndrome involve your eyes and mouth. • Dental cavities. • Because saliva helps protect the teeth from the bacteria that cause cavities, you're more prone to developing cavities if your mouth is dry. • Yeast infections. • People with Sjogren's syndrome are much more likely to develop oral thrush, a yeast infection in the mouth. • Vision problems. • Dry eyes can lead to light sensitivity, blurred vision and corneal damage. • Less common complications might affect: Lungs, kidneys or liver. • Inflammation can cause pneumonia, bronchitis or other problems in your lungs; lead to problems with kidney function; and cause hepatitis or cirrhosis in your liver. • Lymph nodes. • A small percentage of people with Sjogren's syndrome develop cancer of the lymph nodes (lymphoma). • Nerves. • You might develop numbness, tingling and burning in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy).",

      "Overview": "Skin cancer — the abnormal growth of skin cells — most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. • But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. • There are three major types of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. • You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by limiting or avoiding exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. • Checking your skin for suspicious changes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. • Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. • But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. • Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. • When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. • Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face. • Basal cell carcinoma may appear as: A pearly or waxy bump A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. • People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. • Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as: A firm, red nodule A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. • Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. • In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. • In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. • Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. • In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. • Melanoma signs include: A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black A painful lesion that itches or burns Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus Other, less common types of skin cancer include: Kaposi sarcoma. • This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. • Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. • Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage. • Merkel cell carcinoma. • Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. • Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. • Sebaceous gland carcinoma. • This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. • Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems. • Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any changes to your skin that worry you. • Not all skin changes are caused by skin cancer. • Your doctor will investigate your skin changes to determine a cause. • Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. • The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. • Skin cancer begins in your skin's top layer — the epidermis. • The epidermis is a thin layer that provides a protective cover of skin cells that your body continually sheds. • The epidermis contains three main types of cells: Squamous cells lie just below the outer surface and function as the skin's inner lining. • Basal cells, which produce new skin cells, sit beneath the squamous cells. • Melanocytes — which produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its normal color — are located in the lower part of your epidermis. • Melanocytes produce more melanin when you're in the sun to help protect the deeper layers of your skin. • Where your skin cancer begins determines its type and your treatment options. • Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds. • But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. • This indicates that other factors may contribute to your risk of skin cancer, such as being exposed to toxic substances or having a condition that weakens your immune system. • Factors that may increase your risk of skin cancer include: Fair skin. • Anyone, regardless of skin color, can get skin cancer. • However, having less pigment (melanin) in your skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation. • If you have blond or red hair and light-colored eyes, and you freckle or sunburn easily, you're much more likely to develop skin cancer than is a person with darker skin. • A history of sunburns. • Having had one or more blistering sunburns as a child or teenager increases your risk of developing skin cancer as an adult. • Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor. • Excessive sun exposure. • Anyone who spends considerable time in the sun may develop skin cancer, especially if the skin isn't protected by sunscreen or clothing. • Tanning, including exposure to tanning lamps and beds, also puts you at risk. • A tan is your skin's injury response to excessive UV radiation. • Sunny or high-altitude climates. • People who live in sunny, warm climates are exposed to more sunlight than are people who live in colder climates. • Living at higher elevations, where the sunlight is strongest, also exposes you to more radiation. • Moles. • People who have many moles or abnormal moles called dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of skin cancer. • These abnormal moles — which look irregular and are generally larger than normal moles — are more likely than others to become cancerous. • If you have a history of abnormal moles, watch them regularly for changes. • Precancerous skin lesions. • Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. • These precancerous skin growths typically appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to dark pink. • They're most common on the face, head and hands of fair-skinned people whose skin has been sun damaged. • A family history of skin cancer. • If one of your parents or a sibling has had skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease. • A personal history of skin cancer. • If you developed skin cancer once, you're at risk of developing it again. • A weakened immune system. • People with weakened immune systems have a greater risk of developing skin cancer. • This includes people living with HIV/AIDS and those taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant. • Exposure to radiation. • People who received radiation treatment for skin conditions such as eczema and acne may have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma. • Exposure to certain substances. • Exposure to certain substances, such as arsenic, may increase your risk of skin cancer. • Most skin cancers are preventable. • To protect yourself, follow these skin cancer prevention tips: Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. • For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. • Schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day, even in winter or when the sky is cloudy. • You absorb UV radiation year-round, and clouds offer little protection from damaging rays. • Avoiding the sun at its strongest helps you avoid the sunburns and suntans that cause skin damage and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. • Sun exposure accumulated over time also may cause skin cancer. • Wear sunscreen year-round. • Sunscreens don't filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially the radiation that can lead to melanoma. • But they play a major role in an overall sun protection program. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. • Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck. • Wear protective clothing. • Sunscreens don't provide complete protection from UV rays. • So cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than a baseball cap or visor does. • Some companies also sell photoprotective clothing. • A dermatologist can recommend an appropriate brand. • Don't forget sunglasses. • Look for those that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays. • Avoid tanning beds. • Lights used in tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer. • Be aware of sun-sensitizing medications. • Some common prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including antibiotics, can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. • Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the side effects of any medications you take. • If they increase your sensitivity to sunlight, take extra precautions to stay out of the sun in order to protect your skin. • Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. • Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. • With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. • Examine your chest and trunk, and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. • Examine both the front and back of your legs, and your feet, including the soles and the spaces between your toes. • Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.",

      "Overview": "Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. • If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea. • The main types of sleep apnea are: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax and block the flow of air into the lungs Central sleep apnea (CSA), which occurs when the brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, also known as complex sleep apnea, which happens when someone has OSA — diagnosed with a sleep study — that converts to CSA when receiving therapy for OSA If you think you might have sleep apnea, see your health care provider. • Treatment can ease your symptoms and might help prevent heart problems and other complications.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas overlap, sometimes making it difficult to determine which type you have. • The most common symptoms of obstructive and central sleep apneas include: Loud snoring. • Episodes in which you stop breathing during sleep — which would be reported by another person. • Gasping for air during sleep. • Awakening with a dry mouth. • Morning headache. • Difficulty staying asleep, known as insomnia. • Excessive daytime sleepiness, known as hypersomnia. • Difficulty paying attention while awake. • Irritability. • Loud snoring can indicate a potentially serious problem, but not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. • Talk to your health care provider if you have symptoms of sleep apnea. • Ask your provider about any sleep problem that leaves you fatigued, sleepy and irritable. • This type of sleep apnea happens when the muscles in the back of the throat relax. • These muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate called the uvula, the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue. • When the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. • You can't get enough air, which can lower the oxygen level in your blood. • Your brain senses that you can't breathe, and briefly wakes you so that you can reopen your airway. • This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it. • You might snort, choke or gasp. • This pattern can repeat itself 5 to 30 times or more each hour, all night. • This makes it hard to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep. • This less common form of sleep apnea occurs when your brain fails to send signals to your breathing muscles. • This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period. • You might awaken with shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep. • Sleep apnea can affect anyone, even children. • But certain factors increase your risk. • Factors that increase the risk of this form of sleep apnea include: Excess weight. • Obesity greatly increases the risk of OSA. • Fat deposits around your upper airway can obstruct your breathing. • Neck circumference. • People with thicker necks might have narrower airways. • A narrowed airway. • You might have inherited a narrow throat. • Tonsils or adenoids also can enlarge and block the airway, particularly in children. • Being male. • Men are 2 to 3 times more likely to have sleep apnea than are women. • However, women increase their risk if they're overweight or if they've gone through menopause. • Being older. • Sleep apnea occurs significantly more often in older adults. • Family history. • Having family members with sleep apnea might increase your risk. • Use of alcohol, sedatives or tranquilizers. • These substances relax the muscles in your throat, which can worsen obstructive sleep apnea. • Smoking. • Smokers are three times more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea than are people who've never smoked. • Smoking can increase the amount of inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway. • Nasal congestion. • If you have trouble breathing through your nose — whether from an anatomical problem or allergies — you're more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea. • Medical conditions. • Congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes are some of the conditions that may increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. • Polycystic ovary syndrome, hormonal disorders, prior stroke and chronic lung diseases such as asthma also can increase risk. • Risk factors for this form of sleep apnea include: Being older. • Middle-aged and older people have a higher risk of central sleep apnea. • Being male. • Central sleep apnea is more common in men than it is in women. • Heart disorders. • Having congestive heart failure increases the risk. • Using narcotic pain medicines. • Opioid medicines, especially long-acting ones such as methadone, increase the risk of central sleep apnea. • Stroke. • Having had a stroke increases the risk of central sleep apnea. • Sleep apnea is a serious medical condition. • Complications of OSA can include: Daytime fatigue. • The repeated awakenings associated with sleep apnea make typical, restorative sleep impossible, in turn making severe daytime drowsiness, fatigue and irritability likely. • You might have trouble concentrating and find yourself falling asleep at work, while watching TV or even when driving. • People with sleep apnea have an increased risk of motor vehicle and workplace accidents. • You might also feel quick-tempered, moody or depressed. • Children and adolescents with sleep apnea might perform poorly in school or have behavior problems. • High blood pressure or heart problems. • Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during OSA increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. • Having OSA increases your risk of high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. • OSA might also increase your risk of recurrent heart attack, stroke and irregular heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. • If you have heart disease, multiple episodes of low blood oxygen (hypoxia or hypoxemia) can lead to sudden death from an irregular heartbeat. • Type 2 diabetes. • Having sleep apnea increases your risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. • Metabolic syndrome. • This disorder, which includes high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood sugar and an increased waist circumference, is linked to a higher risk of heart disease. • Complications with medicines and surgery. • Obstructive sleep apnea is also a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia. • People with sleep apnea might be more likely to have complications after major surgery because they're prone to breathing problems, especially when sedated and lying on their backs. • Before you have surgery, tell your doctor about your sleep apnea and how it's being treated. • Liver problems. • People with sleep apnea are more likely to have irregular results on liver function tests, and their livers are more likely to show signs of scarring, known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. • Sleep-deprived partners. • Loud snoring can keep anyone who sleeps nearby from getting good rest. • It's common for a partner to have to go to another room, or even to another floor of the house, to be able to sleep. • Complications of CSA can include: Fatigue. • The repeated awakening associated with sleep apnea makes typical, restorative sleep impossible. • People with central sleep apnea often have severe fatigue, daytime drowsiness and irritability. • You might have difficulty concentrating and find yourself falling asleep at work, while watching television or even while driving. • Cardiovascular problems. • Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during central sleep apnea can adversely affect heart health. • If there's underlying heart disease, these repeated multiple episodes of low blood oxygen — known as hypoxia or hypoxemia — worsen prognosis and increase the risk of irregular heart rhythms.",
      "Causes": "This type of sleep apnea happens when the muscles in the back of the throat relax. • These muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate called the uvula, the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue. • When the muscles relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. • You can't get enough air, which can lower the oxygen level in your blood. • Your brain senses that you can't breathe, and briefly wakes you so that you can reopen your airway. • This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it. • You might snort, choke or gasp. • This pattern can repeat itself 5 to 30 times or more each hour, all night. • This makes it hard to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep. • This less common form of sleep apnea occurs when your brain fails to send signals to your breathing muscles. • This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period. • You might awaken with shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep.",
      "Risk factors": "Sleep apnea can affect anyone, even children. • But certain factors increase your risk. • Factors that increase the risk of this form of sleep apnea include: Excess weight. • Obesity greatly increases the risk of OSA. • Fat deposits around your upper airway can obstruct your breathing. • Neck circumference. • People with thicker necks might have narrower airways. • A narrowed airway. • You might have inherited a narrow throat. • Tonsils or adenoids also can enlarge and block the airway, particularly in children. • Being male. • Men are 2 to 3 times more likely to have sleep apnea than are women. • However, women increase their risk if they're overweight or if they've gone through menopause. • Being older. • Sleep apnea occurs significantly more often in older adults. • Family history. • Having family members with sleep apnea might increase your risk. • Use of alcohol, sedatives or tranquilizers. • These substances relax the muscles in your throat, which can worsen obstructive sleep apnea. • Smoking. • Smokers are three times more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea than are people who've never smoked. • Smoking can increase the amount of inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway. • Nasal congestion. • If you have trouble breathing through your nose — whether from an anatomical problem or allergies — you're more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea. • Medical conditions. • Congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes are some of the conditions that may increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. • Polycystic ovary syndrome, hormonal disorders, prior stroke and chronic lung diseases such as asthma also can increase risk. • Risk factors for this form of sleep apnea include: Being older. • Middle-aged and older people have a higher risk of central sleep apnea. • Being male. • Central sleep apnea is more common in men than it is in women. • Heart disorders. • Having congestive heart failure increases the risk. • Using narcotic pain medicines. • Opioid medicines, especially long-acting ones such as methadone, increase the risk of central sleep apnea. • Stroke. • Having had a stroke increases the risk of central sleep apnea.",
      "Complications": "Sleep apnea is a serious medical condition. • Complications of OSA can include: Daytime fatigue. • The repeated awakenings associated with sleep apnea make typical, restorative sleep impossible, in turn making severe daytime drowsiness, fatigue and irritability likely. • You might have trouble concentrating and find yourself falling asleep at work, while watching TV or even when driving. • People with sleep apnea have an increased risk of motor vehicle and workplace accidents. • You might also feel quick-tempered, moody or depressed. • Children and adolescents with sleep apnea might perform poorly in school or have behavior problems. • High blood pressure or heart problems. • Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during OSA increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. • Having OSA increases your risk of high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. • OSA might also increase your risk of recurrent heart attack, stroke and irregular heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. • If you have heart disease, multiple episodes of low blood oxygen (hypoxia or hypoxemia) can lead to sudden death from an irregular heartbeat. • Type 2 diabetes. • Having sleep apnea increases your risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. • Metabolic syndrome. • This disorder, which includes high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood sugar and an increased waist circumference, is linked to a higher risk of heart disease. • Complications with medicines and surgery. • Obstructive sleep apnea is also a concern with certain medicines and general anesthesia. • People with sleep apnea might be more likely to have complications after major surgery because they're prone to breathing problems, especially when sedated and lying on their backs. • Before you have surgery, tell your doctor about your sleep apnea and how it's being treated. • Liver problems. • People with sleep apnea are more likely to have irregular results on liver function tests, and their livers are more likely to show signs of scarring, known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. • Sleep-deprived partners. • Loud snoring can keep anyone who sleeps nearby from getting good rest. • It's common for a partner to have to go to another room, or even to another floor of the house, to be able to sleep. • Complications of CSA can include: Fatigue. • The repeated awakening associated with sleep apnea makes typical, restorative sleep impossible. • People with central sleep apnea often have severe fatigue, daytime drowsiness and irritability. • You might have difficulty concentrating and find yourself falling asleep at work, while watching television or even while driving. • Cardiovascular problems. • Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during central sleep apnea can adversely affect heart health. • If there's underlying heart disease, these repeated multiple episodes of low blood oxygen — known as hypoxia or hypoxemia — worsen prognosis and increase the risk of irregular heart rhythms."

      "Overview": "Sleep disorders are conditions that change the way you sleep. • If you have a sleep disorder, you may not get enough sleep or you may not feel rested when you wake up. • You may be very sleepy during the daytime. • You may have changes in breathing or move around a lot during sleep. • Or you may have problems getting to sleep, staying asleep or waking too early. • A sleep disorder can affect your overall health, safety and quality of life. • Not getting a good night's sleep can affect your ability to drive or work safely. • It also can raise your risk of other health problems. • But treatment can help you get the sleep you need.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of common sleep disorders include: Being very sleepy during the daytime. • You may fall asleep at times that aren't typical, such as while driving or while working at your desk. • Trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night and not being able to go back to sleep. • Or you may wake up too early. • Breathing in a pattern that isn't typical. • This may include snoring, snorting, gasping, choking or pausing during breathing. • Feeling an urge to move that is not comfortable while you're trying to fall asleep. • Your legs or arms may feel tingly or crawly. • Moving too much or having movements that bother you during sleep, such as arm and leg movements or teeth grinding. • Activities during sleep that are not usual, such as sleepwalking, sleep-eating or bed-wetting. • Anyone can have an occasional poor night's sleep. • But talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you regularly have trouble getting enough sleep, if you don't feel rested when you wake up or if you feel overly sleepy during the day.",
      "Causes": "There are many different types of sleep disorders, and the causes vary widely. • Sleep disorders are often grouped according to why they happen or their effects. • Sleep disorders also can be grouped based on behaviors, problems with your natural sleep-wake cycles, breathing problems, difficulty sleeping or how sleepy you feel during the day. • Sometimes the exact cause is not known, but several factors can increase the risk of having a sleep disorder.",
      "Risk factors": "These issues can raise the risk of sleep disorders: Age. • Sleep varies depending on age, and age may play a role in sleep disorders. • Some sleep disorders, such as bed-wetting, may be more common in children. • Other sleep disorders are more common with older age. • Genetics. • Having some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, sleepwalking, and sleep apnea, may be more likely if a family member also has them. • Medical conditions. • Brain and nerve conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, may raise the risk of sleep disorders. • Heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic pain are linked with insomnia. • Being overweight raises the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. • Heart failure and atrial fibrillation raise the risk of central sleep apnea. • Mental health conditions. • Stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions may affect sleep. • Schedule changes. • Jet lag or shift work can change your sleep-wake cycle and disrupt sleep. • Medicines and drugs. • Certain medicines, caffeine, alcohol, and legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets, also called recreational drugs, can affect sleep.",
      "Complications": "Untreated sleep disorders are linked with serious complications. • These can include a higher risk or worsening of medical conditions such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. • Sleep disorders also can affect mental health. • And ongoing insomnia can raise the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. • Sleep disorders can affect your quality of life. • Excessive daytime sleepiness can make it hard to focus and pay attention. • This can impact driving safety, workplace errors and how well you do in school."

      "Overview": "Small bowel cancer is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the small intestine. • The small intestine, also called the small bowel, is a long tube that carries digested food between the stomach and the large intestine. • The small intestine digests and absorbs nutrients from the foods you eat. • It produces hormones that help with digestion. • The small intestine also plays a role in the body's germ-fighting immune system. • It contains cells that fight bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth. • Small bowel cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. • Other treatments include chemotherapy and targeted therapy, which use medicines to kill cancer cells. • Radiation therapy also may be used to shrink the cancer before surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of small bowel cancer include: Abdominal pain. • Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, called jaundice. • Feeling very weak or tired. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Losing weight without trying. • Blood in the stool, which might look red or black. • Watery diarrhea. • Skin flushing. • The cause of small bowel cancer isn't known. • What's known is that something happens to cells in the small bowel that changes them into cancer cells. • Small bowel cancer happens when cells develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. • The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This causes too many cells. • The cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • The type of small bowel cancer

places in the body. • They do some nerve cell functions and some of the work of cells that make hormones. • Lymphoma. • Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in immune system cells. • The body's immune system fights germs. • Immune system cells in the small intestine fight bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth. • Most lymphomas in the small bowel are a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. • Soft tissue sarcoma. • Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that start in the body's connective tissues. • One type of soft tissue sarcoma is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, also known as GIST. • GIST starts in special nerve cells that are found in the wall of the small bowel. • Your health care team considers your type of small bowel cancer when creating a treatment plan. • Factors that may increase the risk of small bowel cancer include: DNA changes that run in families. • Some DNA changes that are passed down from your parents can increase your risk of small bowel cancer and other cancers. • Examples include Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, also called FAP, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. • Other bowel diseases. • Other diseases and conditions that affect the intestines may increase the risk of small bowel cancer. • These may include Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. • Weakened immune system. • If your body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened, you may have an increased risk of small bowel cancer. • Examples include people with HIV infection and those who take medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant. • What you eat and drink. • Some studies have found a higher risk of small bowel cancer in those who eat and drink certain things. • For example, the risk seems to be associated with drinking alcohol and eating a diet that's low in fiber and high in red meat, sugar, and salt-cured and smoked foods. • Small bowel cancer can cause complications, including: An increased risk of other cancers. • People who have small bowel cancer run a higher risk of having other types of cancers. • These may include those that affect the colon, rectum, ovaries and the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. • Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body. • Advanced small bowel cancer can spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • Small bowel cancer most often spreads to the liver. • It's not clear what may help to reduce the risk of small bowel cancer. • If you're interested in reducing your risk of cancer in general, it may help to: Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. • Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get different vitamins and nutrients. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Stop smoking. • Talk to a health care professional about ways to quit that may work for you. • Exercise most days of the week. • Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. • If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. • Also, talk to your health care team before starting any exercise program. • Maintain a healthy weight. • If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. • If you

      "Overview": "Small bowel prolapse, also called enterocele (EN-tur-o-seel), occurs when the small intestine (small bowel) descends into the lower pelvic cavity and pushes at the top part of the vagina, creating a bulge. • The word \"prolapse\" means to slip or fall out of place. • Childbirth, aging and other processes that put pressure on your pelvic floor may weaken the muscles and ligaments that support pelvic organs, making small bowel prolapse more likely to occur. • To manage small bowel prolapse, self-care measures and other nonsurgical options are often effective. • In severe cases, you may need surgery to fix the prolapse.",
      "Symptoms": "Mild small bowel prolapse may produce no signs or symptoms. • However, if you have significant prolapse, you might experience: A pulling sensation in your pelvis that eases when you lie down A feeling of pelvic fullness, pressure or pain Low back pain that eases when you lie down A soft bulge of tissue in your vagina Vaginal discomfort and painful intercourse (dyspareunia) Many women with small bowel prolapse also experience prolapse of other pelvic organs, such as the bladder, uterus or rectum. • See your doctor if you develop signs or symptoms of prolapse that bother you. • Increased pressure on the pelvic floor is the main reason for any form of pelvic organ prolapse. • Conditions and activities that can cause or contribute to small bowel prolapse or other types of prolapse include: Pregnancy and childbirth Chronic constipation or straining with bowel movements Chronic cough or bronchitis Repeated heavy lifting Being overweight or obese Pregnancy and childbirth are the most common causes of pelvic organ prolapse. • The muscles, ligaments and fascia that hold and support your vagina stretch and weaken during pregnancy, labor and delivery. • Not everyone who has had a baby develops pelvic organ prolapse. • Some women have very strong supporting muscles, ligaments and fascia in the pelvis and never have a problem. • It's also possible for a woman who's never had a baby to develop pelvic organ prolapse. • Factors that increase your risk of developing small bowel prolapse include: Pregnancy and childbirth. • Vaginal delivery of one or more children contributes to the weakening of your pelvic floor support structures, increasing your risk of prolapse. • The more pregnancies you have, the greater your risk of developing any type of pelvic organ prolapse. • Women who have only cesarean deliveries are less likely to develop prolapse. • Age. • Small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse occur more often with increasing age. • As you get older, you tend to lose muscle mass and muscle strength — in your pelvic muscles as well as other muscles. • Pelvic surgery. • Removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) or surgical procedures to treat incontinence may increase your risk of developing small bowel prolapse. • Increased abdominal pressure. • Being overweight increases pressure inside your abdomen, which increases your risk of developing small bowel prolapse. • Other factors that increase pressure include ongoing (chronic) cough and straining during bowel movements. • Smoking. • Smoking is associated with developing prolapse because smokers frequently cough, increasing abdominal pressure. • Race. • For unknown reasons, Hispanic and white women are at higher risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse. • Connective tissue disorders. • You may be genetically prone to prolapse due to weaker connective tissues in your pelvic area, making you naturally more susceptible to small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse. • You may be able to lower your chances of small bowel prolapse with these strategies: Maintain a healthy weight. • If you're overweight, losing some weight can decrease the pressure inside your abdomen. • Prevent constipation. • Eat high-fiber foods, drink plenty of fluids and exercise regularly to help prevent having to strain during bowel movements. • Treat a chronic cough. • Constant coughing increases abdominal pressure. • See your doctor to ask about treatment if you have an ongoing (chronic) cough. • Quit smoking. • Smoking contributes to chronic coughing. • Avoid heavy lifting. • Lifting heavy objects increases abdominal pressure.",

      "Overview": "Smallpox is a serious and often deadly viral infection. • It's contagious — meaning it spreads from person to person — and can cause permanent scarring. • Sometimes, it causes disfigurement. • Smallpox has affected humans for thousands of years but was wiped out worldwide by 1980 thanks to smallpox vaccines. • It's no longer found naturally in the world. • The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977. • Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. • And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab. • This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon. • Vaccines can prevent smallpox, but because most people are unlikely to come in contact with smallpox naturally, routine vaccination isn't recommended. • New antiviral medications can be used to treat people who develop smallpox.",
      "Symptoms": "The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to 14 days after you're exposed to the smallpox virus. • However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. • This time is called the incubation period. • After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. • These include: Fever Muscle aches Headache Severe fatigue Severe back pain Vomiting, sometimes A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. • They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. • The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet. • Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. • Later, the blisters fill with pus. • These sores are called pustules. • Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars. • Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.",
      "Causes": "Smallpox is caused by the variola virus. • The virus can spread: Directly from person to person. • You can catch the smallpox virus by being around someone who has it. • An infected person can spread the virus when they cough, sneeze or talk. • Coming in contact with skin sores also can cause you to get smallpox. • Indirectly from an infected person. • Rarely, smallpox can spread through the air inside buildings, infecting people in other rooms or on other floors. • Through contaminated items. • Smallpox can also spread through contact with contaminated clothing and bedding. • But getting smallpox this way is less likely. • As a terrorist weapon, potentially. • Using smallpox as a weapon is an unlikely threat. • But because releasing the virus could spread the disease quickly, governments are preparing for this possibility.",
      "Complications": "Most people who get smallpox survive. • However, some rare types of smallpox are almost always deadly. • These more-severe forms are most common in pregnant women and children. • People who recover from smallpox usually have severe scars, especially on the face, arms and legs. • Sometimes, smallpox causes vision loss (blindness).",
      "Prevention": "If a smallpox outbreak happened, people with smallpox would be isolated to try to stop the spread of the virus. • Anyone who had contact with someone who had smallpox would need a smallpox vaccine. • A vaccine can protect you from getting sick or cause you to get less sick if you get smallpox. • The vaccine should be given before or one week after exposure to the virus. • Two vaccines are available: The ACAM2000 vaccine uses a live virus that's like smallpox, but less harmful. • It can sometimes cause serious side effects, such as infections in the heart or brain. • That's why the vaccine is not given to everyone. • Unless there is a smallpox outbreak, the risks of the vaccine outweigh the benefits for most people. • A second vaccine (Jynneos) uses a very weakened strain of virus and is safer than ACAM2000. • It can be used in people who can't take ACAM2000 due to compromised immune systems or skin disorders. • Smallpox vaccines also provide protection against other similar viral infections such as mpox, also known as monkeypox, and cowpox. • If you had the smallpox vaccine as a child, you have some level of protection against the smallpox virus. • Full or partial immunity after a smallpox vaccine may last up to 10 years, and 20 years with booster shots. • If an outbreak happened, people who got vaccinated as children would likely get a new vaccination if they were exposed to the virus."

      "Overview": "Snoring is the hoarse or harsh sound that occurs when air flows past relaxed tissues in your throat, causing the tissues to vibrate as you breathe. • Nearly everyone snores now and then, but for some people it can be a chronic problem. • Sometimes it may also indicate a serious health condition. • In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner. • Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring. • In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. • However, these aren't suitable or necessary for everyone who snores.",
      "Symptoms": "Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). • Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: Witnessed breathing pauses during sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness Difficulty concentrating Morning headaches Sore throat upon awakening Restless sleep Gasping or choking at night High blood pressure Chest pain at night Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep In children, poor attention span, behavioral issues or poor performance in school OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. • Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. • You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. • This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. • People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep. • See your doctor if you have any of the above symptoms. • These may indicate your snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). • If your child snores, ask your pediatrician about it. • Children can have OSA, too. • Nose and throat problems — such as enlarged tonsils — and obesity often can narrow a child's airway, which can lead to your child developing OSA. • Snoring can be caused by a number of factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight. • When you doze off and progress from a light sleep to a deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue and throat relax. • The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate. • The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes. • This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder. • The following conditions can affect the airway and cause snoring: Your mouth anatomy. • Having a low, thick soft palate can narrow your airway. • People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the back of their throats that may narrow their airways. • Likewise, if the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula) is elongated, airflow can be obstructed and vibration increased. • Alcohol consumption. • Snoring can also be brought on by consuming too much alcohol before bedtime. • Alcohol relaxes throat muscles and decreases your natural defenses against airway obstruction. • Nasal problems. • Chronic nasal congestion or a crooked partition between your nostrils (deviated nasal septum) may contribute to your snoring. • Sleep deprivation. • Not getting enough sleep can lead to further throat relaxation. • Sleep position. • Snoring is typically most frequent and loudest when sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat narrows the airway. • Risk factors that may contribute to snoring include: Being a man. • Men are more likely to snore or have sleep apnea than are women. • Being overweight. • People who are overweight or obese are more likely to snore or have obstructive sleep apnea. • Having a narrow airway. • Some people may have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, which can narrow the airway and cause snoring. • Drinking alcohol. • Alcohol relaxes your throat muscles, increasing the risk of snoring. • Having nasal problems. • If you have a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, or your nose is chronically congested, your risk of snoring is greater. • Having a family history of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea. • Heredity is a potential risk factor for OSA. • Habitual snoring may be more than just a nuisance. • Aside from disrupting a bed partner's sleep, if snoring is associated with OSA, you may be at risk for other complications, including: Daytime sleepiness Frequent frustration or anger Difficulty concentrating A greater risk of high blood pressure, heart conditions and stroke An increased risk of behavior problems, such as aggression or learning problems, in children with OSA An increased risk of motor vehicle accidents due to lack of sleep",

      "Overview": "It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. • For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. • But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others. • In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. • Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. • Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.",
      "Symptoms": "Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. • Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. • Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing. • In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. • Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults. • Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant: Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers Fear that others will notice that you look anxious Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event Intense fear or anxiety during social situations Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations. • Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations. • Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include: Blushing Fast heartbeat Trembling Sweating Upset stomach or nausea Trouble catching your breath Dizziness or lightheadedness Feeling that your mind has gone blank Muscle tension Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including: Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers Attending parties or social gatherings Going to work or school Starting conversations Making eye contact Dating Entering a room in which people are already seated Returning items to a store Eating in front of others Using a public restroom Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. • They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. • Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment. • See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic. • Like many other mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors. • Possible causes include: Inherited traits. • Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. • However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior. • Brain structure. • A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. • People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations. • Environment. • Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior — some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. • Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children. • Several factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including: Family history. • You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition. • Negative experiences. • Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. • In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder. • Temperament. • Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk. • New social or work demands. • Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time. • Having an appearance or condition that draws attention. • For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people. • Left untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life. • Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life. • This disorder can cause: Low self-esteem Trouble being assertive Negative self-talk Hypersensitivity to criticism Poor social skills Isolation and difficult social relationships Low academic and employment achievement Substance abuse, such as drinking too much alcohol Suicide or suicide attempts Other anxiety disorders and certain other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and substance abuse problems, often occur with social anxiety disorder. • There's no way to predict what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious: Get help early. • Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait. • Keep a journal. • Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better. • Set priorities in your life. • You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. • Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy. • Avoid unhealthy substance use. • Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. • If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. • If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.",

      "Overview": "Soft palate cancer is cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the soft palate. • The soft palate is located on the upper part of the back of the mouth, behind the teeth. • Soft palate cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the inside of the mouth and throat, called squamous cells. • When cancer starts in these cells it's called squamous cell carcinoma. • Soft palate cancer can cause changes in the look and feel of the tissue on the soft palate. • These changes may include a lump or a sore that doesn't heal. • Soft palate cancer is considered a type of throat cancer. • It is treated similarly to the way other types of throat cancers are treated. • This may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of soft palate cancer can include the following: Bleeding in the mouth. • Difficulty swallowing. • Difficulty speaking. • Bad breath. • Mouth pain. • Sores in the mouth that won't heal. • Loose teeth. • Pain when swallowing. • Weight loss. • Ear pain. • Swelling in the neck that may hurt. • White patches in the mouth that won't go away. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. • Soft palate cancer happens when cells on the soft palate develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. • It's not always clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to soft palate cancer. • For some soft palate cancers, human papillomavirus is thought to have a part. • HPV is a common virus that's transmitted through sexual contact. • For most people, HPV doesn't cause any problems. • For others, it causes changes in the cells that may one day lead to cancer. • Things that may increase the risk of soft palate cancer include: All forms of tobacco increase the risk of soft palate cancer. • This includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff. • Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of soft palate cancer. • Using alcohol and tobacco together increases the risk even more. • HPV is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. • For most people, it causes no problems and goes away on its own. • For others, it causes changes in the cells that can lead to many types of cancer, including soft palate cancer. • If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medicines or illness, there might be a higher risk of soft palate cancer. • People with a weakened immune system include those taking medicines to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. • Certain medical conditions, such as infection with HIV, also can weaken the immune system. • Ways to reduce your risk of soft palate cancer include: If you don't use tobacco, don't start. • If you currently use tobacco of any kind, talk with a healthcare professional about strategies to help you quit. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of HPV-related cancers, such as soft palate cancer. • Ask your doctor or other healthcare professional whether an HIV vaccine is appropriate for you. • During your appointments, your dentist, doctor or other healthcare professional can check your mouth for signs of cancer and precancerous changes.",

      "Overview": "Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the body's soft tissues. • The soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures. • Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and linings of the joints. • Soft tissue sarcoma can happen anywhere in the body. • It happens most often in the arms, legs and belly. • More than 50 types of soft tissue sarcoma exist. • Some types are more likely to affect children. • Others affect mostly adults. • These cancers can be hard to diagnose because they may be mistaken for many other types of growths. • Soft tissue sarcoma treatment usually involves surgery. • Other treatments might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy. • Treatment depends on the size, type and location of the cancer and how quickly it grows.",
      "Symptoms": "A soft tissue sarcoma may not cause any symptoms at first. • As the cancer grows, it may cause: A noticeable lump or swelling. • Pain, if the growth presses on nerves or muscles. • Make an appointment with your health care team if you have any symptoms that worry you. • It's not clear what causes most soft tissue sarcomas. • Soft tissue sarcoma starts when a connective tissue cell gets changes in its DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • The changes turn the connective tissue cells into cancer cells. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and make more cells. • Healthy cells die as part of their natural cycle, but cancer cells keep growing because they do not have instructions to stop. • The cancer cells form a growth, called a tumor. • In some types of soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells stay in one location. • They continue making more cells and cause the tumor to get bigger. • In other types of soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells might break away and spread to other parts of the body. • The type of cell with DNA changes is what determines the type of soft tissue sarcoma. • For example, angiosarcoma begins in cells in the lining of blood vessels, while liposarcoma starts in fat cells. • Some types of soft tissue sarcoma include: Angiosarcoma. • Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. • Epithelioid sarcoma. • Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). • Kaposi's sarcoma. • Leiomyosarcoma. • Liposarcoma. • Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. • Myxofibrosarcoma. • Rhabdomyosarcoma. • Solitary fibrous tumor. • Synovial sarcoma. • Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. • Factors that may raise the risk of sarcoma include: Inherited syndromes. • A risk of soft tissue sarcoma can run in families. • Genetic syndromes that increase the risk include hereditary retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis and Werner syndrome. • Chemical exposure. • Being exposed to certain chemicals may increase the risk of soft tissue sarcomas. • These chemicals include herbicides, arsenic and dioxin. • Radiation exposure. • Radiation therapy for other cancers can increase the risk of soft tissue sarcomas.",

      "Overview": "Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by an extreme focus on physical symptoms — such as pain or fatigue — that causes major emotional distress and problems functioning. • You may or may not have another diagnosed medical condition associated with these symptoms, but your reaction to the symptoms is not normal. • You often think the worst about your symptoms and frequently seek medical care, continuing to search for an explanation even when other serious conditions have been excluded. • Health concerns may become such a central focus of your life that it's hard to function, sometimes leading to disability. • If you have somatic symptom disorder, you may experience significant emotional and physical distress. • Treatment can help ease symptoms, help you cope and improve your quality of life.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be: Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms Mild, moderate or severe Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling. • These thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include: Constant worry about potential illness Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life. • Because physical symptoms can be related to medical problems, it's important to be evaluated by your primary care provider if you aren't sure what's causing your symptoms. • If your primary care provider believes that you may have somatic symptom disorder, he or she can refer you to a mental health professional. • When physical symptoms considered to be somatic symptom disorder occur, it can be difficult to accept that a life-threatening illness has been eliminated as the cause. • Symptoms cause very real distress for the person and reassurance isn't always helpful. • Encourage your loved one to consider the possibility of a mental health referral to learn ways to cope with the reaction to symptoms and any disability it causes. • Physical disability may cause the person to be dependent and need extra physical care and emotional support that can exhaust caregivers and cause stress on families and relationships. • If you feel overwhelmed by your role as caregiver, you may want to talk to a mental health professional to address your own needs.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of somatic symptom disorder isn't clear, but any of these factors may play a role: Genetic and biological factors, such as an increased sensitivity to pain Family influence, which may be genetic or environmental, or both Personality trait of negativity, which can impact how you identify and perceive illness and bodily symptoms Decreased awareness of or problems processing emotions, causing physical symptoms to become the focus rather than the emotional issues Learned behavior — for example, the attention or other benefits gained from having an illness; or \"pain behaviors\" in response to symptoms, such as excessive avoidance of activity, which can increase your level of disability",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for somatic symptom disorder include: Having anxiety or depression Having a medical condition or recovering from one Being at risk of developing a medical condition, such as having a strong family history of a disease Experiencing stressful life events, trauma or violence Having experienced past trauma, such as childhood sexual abuse Having a lower level of education and socio-economic status",
      "Complications": "Somatic symptom disorder can be associated with: Poor health Problems functioning in daily life, including physical disability Problems with relationships Problems at work or unemployment Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression and personality disorders Increased suicide risk related to depression Financial problems due to excessive health care visits",
      "Prevention": "Little is known about how to prevent somatic symptom disorder. • However, these recommendations may help. • If you have problems with anxiety or depression, seek professional help as soon as possible. • Learn to recognize when you're stressed and how this affects your body — and regularly practice stress management and relaxation techniques. • If you think you have somatic symptom disorder, get treatment early to help stop symptoms from getting worse and impairing your quality of life. • Stick with your treatment plan to help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms."

      "Overview": "Specific phobias are an extreme fear of objects or situations that pose little or no danger but make you highly anxious. • So you try to stay away from these things. • Unlike the brief anxiety you may feel when giving a speech or taking a test, specific phobias are long-lasting. • Without treatment, specific phobias tend to last a lifetime. • Phobias can cause strong physical, mental and emotional responses. • They also can affect how you act at work or school, or in social situations. • Specific phobias are common anxiety disorders. • Overall, they happen more often in females. • Not all phobias need to be treated. • But if a specific phobia affects your daily life, several types of therapies are available to help you work through and conquer your fears — often forever.",
      "Symptoms": "A specific phobia involves a strong, lasting fear of a certain object or situation that's much greater than the actual risk. • There are many types of phobias. • It's common to have a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. • Specific phobias also can happen along with other types of anxiety disorders. • Common types of specific phobias are fears of: Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school. • Nature, such as thunderstorms, heights or the dark. • Animals or insects, such as dogs, snakes or spiders. • Blood, shots or injuries, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures. • Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns. • Each specific phobia has a name. • Phobia comes from the Greek word \"phobos,\" which means fear. • Examples of more common names include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. • No matter what specific phobia you have, you may: Feel intense fear, anxiety and panic right away when exposed to or even thinking about what causes your fear. • Know that your fears are not reasonable or not as big as you think they are, but you cannot control them. • Have anxiety that gets worse as the situation or object gets closer to you physically or in time. • Do everything possible to stay away from an object or situation or face it with extreme anxiety or fear. • Have trouble with daily activities because of your fear. • Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing. • Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries. • Children may have tantrums, or they may cling, cry or refuse to leave a parent's side or approach their fear. • When to see a doctor An extreme fear can make life hard — for example, taking long flights of stairs instead of an elevator. • But it is not a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. • If anxiety negatively affects the way you act at work or school, or in social situations, talk with your doctor or another health care professional, or a mental health professional. • Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, monsters or of being left alone, are common. • Most children outgrow them. • But if your child has an ongoing, strong fear that interferes with how they act at school or work daily, talk to your child's doctor. • The right therapy can help most people. • And the sooner you ask for help, the more likely that therapy will be effective.",
      "Causes": "Much is still not known about what causes specific phobias. • Causes may include: Bad experiences. • Many phobias start because of a bad experience or panic attack related to a specific object or situation. • Sometimes even seeing or hearing about a bad experience can be enough to trigger a phobia. • Genetics or learned behavior. • There may be a link between your specific phobia and the phobia or anxiety of your parents. • This could be due to a blend of genetics and learned behaviors. • Brain function and structure. • Those with specific phobias trigger certain parts of the brain, while a person without these phobias does not have the same response in the brain. • Also, a person with a specific phobia can have a different brain structure than a person without that specific phobia.",
      "Risk factors": "These factors may increase your risk of specific phobias: Age. • Specific phobias can first appear when you're a child, typically by age 10. • But they can occur later in life too. • Your relatives. • If a family member has a specific phobia or anxiety, you're more likely to develop it too. • This could be something passed down to you from a blood relative. • Or children may learn specific phobias by watching how a family member reacts to an object or a situation. • Your temperament. • Your risk may increase if you're more sensitive to anxiety or you're more reserved or negative than what's typical. • A bad experience. • A specific phobia can start when something distressing happens to you, such as being trapped in an elevator or attacked by an animal. • Learning about bad experiences. • Hearing about bad experiences, such as a plane crash, can cause a specific phobia to start. • Changing your behavior. • Avoidance is the most common way people cope with phobias. • By doing so, their anxiety typically gets worse.",
      "Complications": "Although specific phobias may seem silly to others, they can be distressing and damaging to the people who have them. • These phobias can cause problems that affect many areas of life. • They can result in: Social isolation. • Staying away from places and things that are feared can cause problems at work or school, or in connections with others. • Children with these disorders are at risk of problems at school and loneliness. • They also may have trouble in social situations if their behaviors are very different from their peers. • Mood disorders. • Many people with specific phobias have depression and other anxiety disorders. • Substance misuse. • The stress of living with a severe specific phobia may lead to misuse of drugs or alcohol. • Suicide. • Some people with specific phobias may be at risk of suicide. • Strain on loved ones. • To try to keep from feeling anxious, people often rely too much on being reassured by others. • Sometimes this leads to others becoming too protective over the person with anxiety. • For example, a parent may become too protective of a child, resulting in more stress for the parent."

      "Overview": "Spina bifida is a condition that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. • It's a type of neural tube defect. • The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that later becomes the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. • Typically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and closes by the 28th day after conception. • In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close all the way. • This affects the spinal cord and bones of the spine. • Spina bifida can range from being mild to causing serious disabilities. • Symptoms depend on where on the spine the opening is located and how big it is. • Symptoms also depend on whether the spinal cord and nerves are involved. • When necessary, early treatment for spina bifida involves surgery. • However, surgery doesn't always completely restore lost function. • Spina bifida occurs in different types: spina bifida occulta, myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel) or the very rare type, meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel). • Occulta means hidden. • Spina bifida occulta is the mildest and most common type. • This type of spina bifida results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine, called vertebrae. • Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't know they have it. • It may be found during an imaging test such as an X-ray that is done for another reason. • Myelomeningocele is the most serious type. • It also is known as open spina bifida. • The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. • Part of the spinal cord, including the spinal cord's protective covering and spinal nerves, push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back. • Tissues and nerves usually are exposed. • This makes the baby prone to dangerous infections. • This type also may cause loss of movement in the legs, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. • This is a rare type of spina bifida. • In this type, a sac of spinal fluid bulges through an opening in the spine. • No nerves are affected and the spinal cord isn't in the fluid sac. • Babies with meningocele may have some minor trouble with functioning, including with the bladder and bowels.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and from one person to another. • Spina bifida occulta. • Typically, there aren't any symptoms of spina bifida occulta because the spinal nerves aren't involved. • But you can sometimes see symptoms on the newborn's skin above the small gap in the spine. • You might see a tuft of hair, a small dimple or a birthmark. • Sometimes, these skin marks can be symptoms of a spinal cord issue that can be found with MRI or a spinal ultrasound in a newborn. • Meningocele. • This type may affect bladder and bowel function. • Myelomeningocele. • In this most serious type of spina bifida, the spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. • The membranes and part of the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac. • Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. • Babies with this type of spina bifida may have trouble with bladder and bowel function. • They also may experience weakness or lack of movement in the legs. • Babies may have a buildup of fluid in the brain called hydrocephalus that can put pressure on brain tissue. • Typically, myelomeningocele is diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. • Children diagnosed with this condition should be followed by a specialized team of healthcare professionals throughout their lives. • Families can be educated on the different complications to watch for. • Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have symptoms or complications. • In these children, usually only routine pediatric care is needed. • The cause of spina bifida is not known. • It's thought that a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors causes the condition. • This includes having a family history of neural tube defects and getting too little folate, also known as vitamin B-9, during pregnancy. • Spina bifida is more common among Hispanic people and white people. • Also, female babies are affected more often than male babies. • Although healthcare professionals and researchers don't know why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors: Too little folate in the pregnant person's body. • Folate, the natural form of vitamin B-9, is important to the development of a healthy baby. • Folic acid is the synthetic form that's found in supplements and fortified foods. • If folate levels are too low, it's known as a deficiency. • Folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other conditions that affect the neural tube. • Family history of neural tube defects. • Having one child with a condition that affects the neural tube slightly increases the chance of having another baby with the same condition. • The risk increases even more if two previous children have been affected by the condition. • Also, being born with a neural tube defect increases the chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. • However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition. • Some medicines. • Taking anti-seizure medicines such as valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. • This might happen because the medicines interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid. • Diabetes. • Having diabetes that is not well controlled before becoming pregnant increases the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. • Obesity. • Obesity at the time of pregnancy also is associated with an increased risk of spina bifida. • Increased body temperature. • Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. • A high core body temperature can be caused by a fever or by using a sauna or hot tub. • If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your healthcare professional. • You may need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins. • Also tell your healthcare professional about all of the medicines you take. • If you plan ahead, some medicines can be adjusted to lower the potential risk of spina bifida. • Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or it can lead to more-serious physical conditions. • Symptoms are affected by: The size and location of the opening in the spine. • Whether skin covers the affected area. • Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord. • A number of complications may affect children with spina bifida. • But not all children get all of these complications. • Many complications can be treated. • Walking and mobility problems. • The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spinal cord that is affected. • This can cause muscle weakness of the legs. • Sometimes it can cause loss of movement, known as paralysis. • Whether a child can walk depends on the location of the spine that's affected and the size of the opening in the neural tube. • Ability to walk also depends on the care received before and after birth. • Orthopedic complications. • Children with myelomeningocele can have several complications in the legs and spine because of weak muscles. • The complications depend on the location of the spine that's affected. • Possible orthopedic issues may include: Curved spine, known as scoliosis. • Changes that aren't typical, such as an inward-facing foot, known as clubfoot. • Dislocation of the hip. • Bone and joint conditions. • Shortened, tight muscles, known as muscle contractures. • Bowel and bladder symptoms. • Nerves that supply the bladder and bowel usually don't work properly in children with myelomeningocele. • As a result, they can't control their bowel or bladder. • This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord. • Buildup of fluid in the brain, known as hydrocephalus. • Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly have a buildup of fluid in the brain. • This condition is known as hydrocephalus. • Shunt malfunction. • Shunts placed in the brain to treat hydrocephalus can stop working or become infected. • Warning signs may vary. • Some of the warning symptoms of a shunt that isn't working include: Headaches. • Vomiting. • Sleepiness. • Irritability. • Swelling or redness along the shunt. • Confusion. • Changes in the eyes, such as a fixed downward gaze. • Trouble feeding. • Seizures. • Chiari malformation type 2. • Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type 2 is common in children who have myelomeningocele. • The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord. • In Chiari malformation type 2, the brainstem becomes longer and is lower than usual in the spinal canal or area of the neck. • This can cause arm weakness and trouble with breathing and swallowing. • Rarely, this condition can cause compression on this area of the brain. • Surgery is needed to relieve the pressure. • Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain, known as meningitis. • Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. • This potentially dangerous infection may cause brain injury. • Tethered spinal cord. • A tethered spinal cord is when the spinal nerves attach to tissue and stretch. • This can happen with scar tissue that resulted from surgery. • When a spinal cord is tethered, it's less able to grow as the child grows. • It can lead to loss of muscle function in the legs, bowel or bladder. • Surgery can limit the degree of disability. • Sleep-disordered breathing. • Sleep apnea or other sleep conditions can affect both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly those with myelomeningocele. • They may need to be tested to see if they briefly stop breathing several times during sleep, known as sleep apnea. • Getting treatment can improve health and quality of life. • Skin problems. • Children with spina bifida have less feeling in some parts of their bodies and may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or backs. • Blisters or sores can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. • Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of developing wounds in casts. • Latex allergy. • Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. • A latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. • It also can cause a dangerous condition in which the face and airways swell and make it hard to breathe, known as anaphylaxis. • It's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment during childbirth and when caring for a child with spina bifida. • Other complications. • Other medical issues may arise as children with spina bifida get older. • These complications may include urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions and depression. • Children with myelomeningocele may have learning disabilities. • They may have trouble paying attention and learning reading and math. • You can greatly reduce your risk of having a baby with spina bifida or other neural tube defects by taking folic acid supplements. • Begin taking the supplements at least one month before becoming pregnant and continue taking them through the first trimester of pregnancy. • Having enough folic acid in your body by the early weeks of pregnancy is critical to prevent spina bifida. • But many people don't discover that they're pregnant until this time. • For this reason, experts recommend that all people of childbearing age take a supplement of 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day. • It's also helpful to eat foods that contain folate or have had folic acid added to them, known as fortification. • Foods that are fortified with folic acid include: Enriched bread. • Pasta. • Rice. • Some breakfast cereals. • Folic acid may be listed on food packages as folate, which is the natural form of folic acid found in foods. • Adults who are planning pregnancy or who could become pregnant need to get 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid a day. • The body doesn't absorb folate as easily as it absorbs folic acid, and most people don't get the recommended amount of folate through diet alone. • Vitamin supplements that include folic acid are necessary to prevent spina bifida. • It's also possible that folic acid may help lower the risk of other conditions that may be present at birth. • These conditions include a cleft lip, a cleft palate and some heart conditions. • It's also a good idea to eat a healthy diet that includes foods rich in folate or fortified with folic acid. • This vitamin is present naturally in many foods, including: Beans and peas. • Citrus fruits and juices. • Egg yolks. • Cow's milk. • Avocados. • Dark green vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach. • If you have spina bifida or if you've previously given birth to a child with spina bifida, you need extra folic acid before you become pregnant. • If you're taking anti-seizure medicines or you have diabetes, you also may benefit from a higher dose of this B vitamin. • Check with your healthcare professional before taking additional folic acid supplements.",

      "Complications": "Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or it can lead to more-serious physical conditions. • Symptoms are affected by: The size and location of the opening in the spine. • Whether skin covers the affected area. • Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord. • A number of complications may affect children with spina bifida. • But not all children get all of these complications. • Many complications can be treated. • Walking and mobility problems. • The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spinal cord that is affected. • This can cause muscle weakness of the legs. • Sometimes it can cause loss of movement, known as paralysis. • Whether a child can walk depends on the location of the spine that's affected and the size of the opening in the neural tube. • Ability to walk also depends on the care received before and after birth. • Orthopedic complications. • Children with myelomeningocele can have several complications in the legs and spine because of weak muscles. • The complications depend on the location of the spine that's affected. • Possible orthopedic issues may include: Curved spine, known as scoliosis. • Changes that aren't typical, such as an inward-facing foot, known as clubfoot. • Dislocation of the hip. • Bone and joint conditions. • Shortened, tight muscles, known as muscle contractures. • Bowel and bladder symptoms. • Nerves that supply the bladder and bowel usually don't work properly in children with myelomeningocele. • As a result, they can't control their bowel or bladder. • This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord. • Buildup of fluid in the brain, known as hydrocephalus. • Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly have a buildup of fluid in the brain. • This condition is known as hydrocephalus. • Shunt malfunction. • Shunts placed in the brain to treat hydrocephalus can stop working or become infected. • Warning signs may vary. • Some of the warning symptoms of a shunt that isn't working include: Headaches. • Vomiting. • Sleepiness. • Irritability. • Swelling or redness along the shunt. • Confusion. • Changes in the eyes, such as a fixed downward gaze. • Trouble feeding. • Seizures. • Chiari malformation type 2. • Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type 2 is common in children who have myelomeningocele. • The brainstem is the lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord. • In Chiari malformation type 2, the brainstem becomes longer and is lower than usual in the spinal canal or area of the neck. • This can cause arm weakness and trouble with breathing and swallowing. • Rarely, this condition can cause compression on this area of the brain. • Surgery is needed to relieve the pressure. • Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain, known as meningitis. • Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. • This potentially dangerous infection may cause brain injury. • Tethered spinal cord. • A tethered spinal cord is when the spinal nerves attach to tissue and stretch. • This can happen with scar tissue that resulted from surgery. • When a spinal cord is tethered, it's less able to grow as the child grows. • It can lead to loss of muscle function in the legs, bowel or bladder. • Surgery can limit the degree of disability. • Sleep-disordered breathing. • Sleep apnea or other sleep conditions can affect both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly those with myelomeningocele. • They may need to be tested to see if they briefly stop breathing several times during sleep, known as sleep apnea. • Getting treatment can improve health and quality of life. • Skin problems. • Children with spina bifida have less feeling in some parts of their bodies and may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or backs. • Blisters or sores can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. • Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of developing wounds in casts. • Latex allergy. • Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. • A latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. • It also can cause a dangerous condition in which the face and airways swell and make it hard to breathe, known as anaphylaxis. • It's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment during childbirth and when caring for a child with spina bifida. • Other complications. • Other medical issues may arise as children with spina bifida get older. • These complications may include urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions and depression. • Children with myelomeningocele may have learning disabilities. • They may have trouble paying attention and learning reading and math.",
      "Prevention": "You can greatly reduce your risk of having a baby with spina bifida or other neural tube defects by taking folic acid supplements. • Begin taking the supplements at least one month before becoming pregnant and continue taking them through the first trimester of pregnancy. • Having enough folic acid in your body by the early weeks of pregnancy is critical to prevent spina bifida. • But many people don't discover that they're pregnant until this time. • For this reason, experts recommend that all people of childbearing age take a supplement of 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day. • It's also helpful to eat foods that contain folate or have had folic acid added to them, known as fortification. • Foods that are fortified with folic acid include: Enriched bread. • Pasta. • Rice. • Some breakfast cereals. • Folic acid may be listed on food packages as folate, which is the natural form of folic acid found in foods. • Adults who are planning pregnancy or who could become pregnant need to get 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid a day. • The body doesn't absorb folate as easily as it absorbs folic acid, and most people don't get the recommended amount of folate through diet alone. • Vitamin supplements that include folic acid are necessary to prevent spina bifida. • It's also possible that folic acid may help lower the risk of other conditions that may be present at birth. • These conditions include a cleft lip, a cleft palate and some heart conditions. • It's also a good idea to eat a healthy diet that includes foods rich in folate or fortified with folic acid. • This vitamin is present naturally in many foods, including: Beans and peas. • Citrus fruits and juices. • Egg yolks. • Cow's milk. • Avocados. • Dark green vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach. • If you have spina bifida or if you've previously given birth to a child with spina bifida, you need extra folic acid before you become pregnant. • If you're taking anti-seizure medicines or you have diabetes, you also may benefit from a higher dose of this B vitamin. • Check with your healthcare professional before taking additional folic acid supplements."

      "Overview": "A spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a tangle of blood vessels that forms on, in or near the spinal cord. • This creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. • Without treatment, this rare condition can cause lasting damage to the spinal cord. • Oxygen-rich blood enters the spinal cord through arteries. • The arteries usually branch into smaller blood vessels called capillaries. • The spinal cord gets oxygen from the blood in the capillaries. • Then the blood passes into veins and moves away from the spinal cord to the heart and lungs. • But in a spinal AVM, the blood passes directly from the arteries to the veins. • This change in blood flow means that the surrounding cells don't get the oxygen they need. • This can cause cells in the spinal tissue to weaken or die. • The tangled arteries and veins in a spinal AVM also can burst and cause bleeding in the spinal cord. • Sometimes, the AVM gets bigger as blood flow increases. • The AVM can press on the spinal cord and cause weakness or other symptoms. • You might not know you have a spinal AVM unless you have symptoms. • The condition can be treated with surgery to stop or possibly reverse some of the spinal damage.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can differ from person to person. • Symptoms depend on where the AVM is found and how serious it is. • Some people may not notice symptoms for many years, if at all. • Others may experience symptoms that are life-threatening. • Symptoms often begin when people are in their 20s but can occur at earlier or later ages. • Some people are diagnosed under the age of 16. • Symptoms may start suddenly or slowly and may include: Trouble walking or climbing stairs. • Numbness, tingling or sudden pain in the legs. • Weakness on one or both sides of the body. • As the condition gets worse, you may have more symptoms including: Sudden, serious back pain. • Lack of feeling in the legs. • Trouble urinating or having bowel movements. • Headache. • Stiff neck. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you experience symptoms of a spinal AVM.",
      "Causes": "The cause of spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) isn't known. • Most spinal AVMs are present at birth, known as congenital. • But others may happen later in life.",
      "Risk factors": "There are no known risk factors for spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • The condition occurs equally in men and women.",
      "Complications": "Without treatment, a spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can cause disability that gets worse over time. • This is from damage to the spinal cord and surrounding tissues. • This can cause: Trouble moving. • Pain, tingling and numbness. • Damage to the spine. • Bulging blood vessel, known as an aneurysm. • High blood pressure in the veins, known as venous hypertension. • This can cause fluid to build up, called edema. • It also can cause tissues to die due to lack of oxygen, known as spinal cord infarction. • Hemorrhage, which can speed up spinal cord damage."

      "Overview": "A spinal cord injury involves damage to any part of the spinal cord. • It also can include damage to nerves at the end of the spinal cord, known as the cauda equina. • The spinal cord sends and receives signals between the brain and the rest of the body. • A spinal cord injury often causes permanent changes in strength, feeling and other body functions below the site of the injury. • People who have had a spinal cord injury also may experience mental, emotional and social side effects. • Many scientists are optimistic that advances in research will someday make repair of spinal cord injuries possible. • Research studies are ongoing around the world. • In the meantime, treatments and rehabilitation allow many people with spinal cord injuries to lead productive, independent lives.",
      "Symptoms": "The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. • One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. • The other factor is how bad the injury is. • The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. \"The completeness\" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. • Completeness is classified as: Complete. • If all feeling and all ability to control movement are lost below the spinal cord injury, the injury is called complete. • Incomplete. • If some feeling and control of movement remain below the affected area, the injury is called incomplete. • There are varying degrees of incomplete injury. • Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. • Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia. • This means that your arms, hands, trunk, legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury. • Paraplegia. • This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms. • Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. • Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms: Loss of movement. • Loss of or a change in sensation. • This includes a change in the ability to feel heat, cold and touch. • Loss of bowel or bladder control. • Exaggerated reflex activities or spasms. • Changes in sexual function, sexual sensitivity and fertility. • Pain or an intense stinging sensation caused by damage to the nerve fibers in the spinal cord. • Trouble breathing, coughing or clearing secretions from the lungs. • Emergency symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include: Extreme back pain or pressure in the neck, head or back. • Weakness, incoordination or loss of control in any part of the body. • Numbness, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands, fingers, feet or toes. • Loss of bladder or bowel control. • Trouble with balance and walking. • Trouble breathing after injury. • A twisted neck or back. • Anyone who has an injury to the head or neck needs an immediate medical evaluation. • It is safest to assume that the person has a spinal injury until proved otherwise. • This is important because: A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. • If a spinal injury occurs but it is not known, worse injury may occur. • Numbness or paralysis can happen quickly or come on gradually. • The time between injury and treatment can be critical. • Learning the level of the injury can help determine the possible recovery. • Do not move the injured person. • Permanent paralysis and other serious complications can result. • Call 911 or local emergency medical help. • Keep the person still. • Place heavy towels on both sides of the neck. • Or hold the head and neck to prevent them from moving until emergency medical help arrives. • Provide basic first aid, such as stopping bleeding and making the person comfortable, without moving the head or neck. • Spinal cord injuries can result from damage to the spinal cord itself or to the bones that surround the spinal cord, known as the vertebrae. • Injuries also may happen as a result of damage to the ligaments or disks of the spinal column. • A sudden, traumatic blow to the spine can fracture, dislocate, crush or compress one or more of the vertebrae. • A gunshot or knife wound that penetrates and cuts the spinal cord also can cause a spinal cord injury. • Additional damage usually occurs over days or weeks. • This is because of bleeding, swelling and fluid accumulation in and around the spinal cord after an injury. • Other causes of a spinal cord injury don't include trauma. • Arthritis, cancer, inflammation, infections or disk degeneration of the spine can be possible causes. • The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. • The spinal cord is made of soft tissue and is surrounded by bones called vertebrae. • It extends down from the base of the brain and contains nerve cells and groups of nerves called tracts. • The tracts go to different parts of your body. • The lower end of your spinal cord stops a little above your waist in the region called the conus medullaris. • Below this region is a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina. • Tracts in your spinal cord carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. • Motor tracts carry signals from your brain to control muscle movement. • Sensory tracts carry signals from body parts to your brain relating to heat, cold, pressure, pain, and the position of your arms and legs. • Whether the cause is traumatic or nontraumatic, spinal cord damage affects the nerve fibers passing through the injured area. • This can impair part of or all the muscles and nerves below the injury site. • An injury to the chest or lower back can affect the trunk, legs, bowel, bladder and sexual function. • A neck injury affects the same areas plus movements of the arms and possibly the ability to breathe. • The most common causes of spinal cord injuries in the United States are: Motor vehicle accidents. • Auto and motorcycle accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries. • They account for almost half of new spinal cord injuries each year. • Falls. • A spinal cord injury after age 65 is most often caused by a fall. • Acts of violence. • About 12% of spinal cord injuries result from violent encounters, usually from gunshot wounds. • Knife wounds also are common. • Sports and recreation injuries. • Athletic activities, such as impact sports and diving in shallow water, cause about 10% of spinal cord injuries. • Diseases. • Cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis and inflammation of the spinal cord also can cause spinal cord injuries. • A spinal cord injury usually results from an accident and can happen to anyone. • But certain factors can increase the risk of having a spinal cord injury, including: Being male. • Spinal cord injuries largely affect men. • In fact, women account for only about 20% of traumatic spinal cord injuries in the United States. • Being between the ages of 16 and 30. • More than half of spinal cord injuries occur in people in this age range. • Being 65 and older. • Another spike in spinal cord injuries occurs at age 65. • Falls cause most injuries in older adults. • Alcohol use. • Alcohol use is involved in about 25% of traumatic spinal cord injuries. • Engaging in risky behavior. • Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries for people under 65. • Other risky behaviors include diving into shallow water and playing sports without wearing safety gear or taking proper precautions. • Having certain diseases. • A minor injury can cause spinal cord damage if you have a condition that affects your joints or bones, such as osteoporosis. • A spinal cord injury can lead to many complications. • Your rehabilitation team helps you develop tools to address these complications. • The team also recommends equipment and resources to promote your quality of life and independence. • Areas often affected include: Bladder control. • The bladder continues to store urine from the kidneys after a spinal cord injury. • But the injury may interfere with the brain receiving the messages it needs to control the bladder. • Changes in bladder control increase the risk of urinary tract infections. • The changes also may cause kidney infections and kidney or bladder stones. • During rehabilitation, you learn ways to help empty your bladder. • Bowel control. • The stomach and intestines work much like they did before the injury, but control of bowel movements is often altered. • A high-fiber diet might help regulate the bowels. • You also can learn ways to help control your bowel. • Pressure injuries. • Below the neurological level of your injury, you might have lost some or all skin sensations. • Therefore, your skin can't send a message to your brain when it's injured by certain things such as prolonged pressure. • This can increase the risk of getting pressure sores. • Changing positions often — with help, if needed — can help prevent the sores. • Proper skin care also can help prevent pressure sores. • Circulatory control. • People with a spinal cord injury may have low blood pressure when they rise, known as orthostatic hypotension. • They also may have swelling in the arms and legs. • This can increase the risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolus. • Another issue with circulatory control is a potentially life-threatening rise in blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. • Your rehabilitation team can teach you how to address these issues if they affect you. • Respiratory system. • If the injury affects the stomach and chest muscles, it may be hard to breathe and cough. • The neurological level of injury determines what kind of breathing problems you may have. • If the injury affects your neck and chest, you might have an increased risk of pneumonia or other lung conditions. • Medicines and therapy can be helpful for treatment and prevention. • Bone density. • A spinal cord injury increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures below the level of injury. • Muscle tone. • Some people with spinal cord injuries have a tightening or motion in the muscles, known as spasticity. • Other people may have soft and limp muscles lacking muscle tone, known as flaccidity. • Fitness and wellness. • Weight loss and muscle thinning are common soon after a spinal cord injury. • Because limited mobility can lead to a more sedentary lifestyle, there is a risk of weight gain, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. • A dietitian can help you eat a nutritious diet to sustain a healthy weight. • Physical and occupational therapists can help you develop a fitness and exercise program. • Sexual health. • A spinal cord injury may lead to changes in erection and ejaculation, or in changes in lubrication. • Healthcare professionals specializing in urology or fertility can offer options for sexual functioning and fertility. • Pain. • Some people have pain, such as muscle or joint pain, from overuse of particular muscle groups. • Nerve pain can occur after a spinal cord injury, especially in someone with an incomplete injury. • Depression. • Pain and the changes a spinal cord injury brings can cause depression in some people. • Following this advice might reduce your risk of a spinal cord injury: Drive safely. • Car crashes are one of the most common causes of spinal cord injuries. • Wear a seat belt every time you are in a moving vehicle. • Make sure that your children wear a seat belt or use an age- and weight-appropriate child safety seat. • To protect them from air bag injuries, children under age 12 should always ride in the back seat. • Check water depth before diving. • Don't dive into a pool unless it's at least 9 feet (about 2.74 meters) deep and clearly marked safe for diving. • Competition diving requires a deeper depth. • And don't dive into an aboveground pool or into water if you don't know how deep it is. • Prevent falls. • Use a step stool with a grab bar to reach high-up objects. • Add handrails along stairways. • Put nonslip mats on tile floors and in the tub or shower. • For young children, use safety gates to block stairs and consider installing window guards. • Take precautions when playing sports. • Always wear recommended safety gear. • Avoid leading with your head in sports. • For example, don't slide headfirst in baseball. • In American football, don't tackle using the top of your helmet. • Use a spotter for new moves in gymnastics. • Don't drink and drive. • Don't drive after drinking alcohol or while under the influence of drugs. • Don't ride with a driver who has been drinking.",

      "Overview": "Spinal headaches are a fairly common complication in those who undergo a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) or spinal anesthesia. • Both procedures require a puncture of the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and, in the lower spine, the lumbar and sacral nerve roots. • During a spinal tap, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal. • During spinal anesthesia, medication is injected into the spinal canal to numb the nerves in the lower half of the body. • If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache. • Most spinal headaches — also known as post-dural puncture headaches — resolve on their own with no treatment. • However, severe spinal headaches lasting 24 hours or more may need treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Spinal headache symptoms include: Dull, throbbing pain that varies in intensity from mild to very severe Pain that typically gets worse when you sit up or stand and decreases or goes away when you lie down Spinal headaches are often accompanied by: Dizziness Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Hearing loss Blurred or double vision Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Nausea and vomiting Neck pain or stiffness Seizures Tell your health care provider if you develop a headache after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia — especially if the headache gets worse when you sit up or stand.",
      "Causes": "Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hole in the membrane (dura mater) that surrounds the spinal cord. • This leakage decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. • Spinal headaches typically appear within 48 to 72 hours after a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia. • Sometimes epidural anesthesia may lead to a spinal headache as well. • Although epidural anesthetic is injected just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord, a spinal headache is possible if the membrane is unintentionally punctured.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for spinal headaches include: Being between the ages of 18 and 30 Being female Being pregnant Having a history of frequent headaches Undergoing procedures involving the use of larger needles or multiple punctures in the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord Having a small body mass"

      "Overview": "Spinal stenosis happens when the space inside the backbone is too small. • This can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that travel through the spine. • Spinal stenosis happens most often in the lower back and the neck. • Some people with spinal stenosis have no symptoms. • Others may experience pain, tingling, numbness and muscle weakness. • Symptoms can get worse over time. • The most common cause of spinal stenosis is wear-and-tear damage in the spine related to arthritis. • People who have serious spinal stenosis may need surgery. • Surgery can create more space inside the spine. • This can ease the symptoms caused by pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. • But surgery can't cure arthritis, so arthritis pain in the spine may continue.",
      "Symptoms": "Spinal stenosis often causes no symptoms. • When symptoms do happen, they start slowly and get worse over time. • Symptoms depend on which part of the spine is affected. • Spinal stenosis in the lower back can cause pain or cramping in one or both legs. • This happens when you stand for a long time or when you walk. • Symptoms get better when you bend forward or sit. • Some people also have back pain. • Spinal stenosis in the neck can cause: Numbness. • Tingling or weakness in a hand, leg, foot or arm. • Problems with walking and balance. • Neck pain. • Problems with the bowel or bladder. • Spinal bones are stacked in a column from the skull to the tailbone. • They protect the spinal cord, which runs through an opening called the spinal canal. • Some people are born with a small spinal canal. • But most spinal stenosis occurs when something happens to reduce the amount of open space within the spine. • Causes of spinal stenosis include: Bone spurs. • Wear-and-tear damage from arthritis can cause extra bone to grow on the spine. • This creates bone spurs that can push into the spinal canal. • Paget's disease also can cause extra bone to grow on the spine. • Herniated disks. • Disks are the soft cushions that act as shock absorbers between the spinal bones. • If part of the disk's soft inner material leaks out, it can press on the spinal cord or nerves. • Thick ligaments. • The strong cords that help hold the bones of the spine together can become stiff and thick over time. • Thick ligaments can push into the spinal canal. • Tumors. • Rarely, tumors can form inside the spinal canal. • Spinal injuries. • Car accidents and other trauma can cause spinal bones to break or move out of place. • Swelling of nearby tissue right after back surgery also can put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. • Most people with spinal stenosis are over age 50. • Younger people may be at higher risk of spinal stenosis if they have scoliosis or other spinal problems.",

      "Overview": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in a wall of a heart artery. • Spontaneous coronary artery dissection also is called SCAD. • SCAD can slow or block blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack, heart rhythm problems or sudden death. • SCAD most commonly affects women in their 40s and 50s, though it can occur at any age and can occur in men. • People who have SCAD often don't have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. • SCAD can cause sudden death if it isn't treated promptly. • Get emergency medical help if you have heart attack symptoms — even if you think you aren't at risk of a heart attack.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of SCAD can include: Chest pain or pressure. • Pain in the arms, shoulders, back or jaw. • Shortness of breath. • Unusual sweating. • Extreme tiredness. • Upset stomach. • A rapid heartbeat or fluttery feeling in the chest. • Feeling dizzy. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have chest pain or think you might be having a heart attack. • If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. • Do not drive yourself unless you have no other choice.",
      "Causes": "The cause of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is unknown.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for SCAD include: Being female. • SCAD can happen to anyone. • But it tends to affect women more than men. • Childbirth. • Some women who have had SCAD have recently given birth. • This may be due to changes in hormones and stress on the blood vessels. • SCAD has been found to occur most often in the first few weeks after delivery. • But SCAD also can occur during pregnancy. • Extreme stress. • SCAD can happen after extreme stress. • This includes intense physical exercise and severe emotional distress. • Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). • This condition causes weakening of the body's medium-sized arteries. • FMD may lead to artery problems such as aneurysm or dissection. • Women are more likely to have it than men. • Genetic conditions affecting connective tissue. • Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes have been found to occur in people who have had SCAD. • Very high blood pressure. • Severe high blood pressure can raise the risk of SCAD. • Illegal drug use. • Using cocaine or other illegal drugs might increase the risk of SCAD.",
      "Complications": "A possible complication of SCAD is heart attack. • SCAD slows or stops blood flow through an artery. • This weakens the heart and may lead to a heart attack. • A heart attack from SCAD is different from a heart attack caused by a buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. • This condition is called atherosclerosis. • In some people with SCAD, the inner and outer layers of the artery may split. • Blood can collect between these layers. • Pressure from the pooled blood can make SCAD worse. • Even with successful treatment, SCAD can happen more than once. • It might happen soon after the first episode or years later. • People who have SCAD also may have a higher risk of other heart problems. • These problems include heart failure due to the heart attack damage."

      "Overview": "A sprain is a stretching or tearing of ligaments — the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect two bones together in your joints. • The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle. • Initial treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. • Mild sprains can be successfully treated at home. • Severe sprains sometimes require surgery to repair torn ligaments. • The difference between a sprain and a strain is that a sprain injures the bands of tissue that connect two bones together, while a strain involves an injury to a muscle or to the band of tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include: Pain Swelling Bruising Limited ability to move the affected joint Hearing or feeling a \"pop\" in your joint at the time of injury Mild sprains can be treated at home. • But the injuries that cause sprains can also cause serious injuries, such as fractures. • You should see a doctor if you: Can't move or bear weight on the affected joint Have pain directly over the bones of an injured joint Have numbness in any part of the injured area",
      "Causes": "A sprain occurs when you overextend or tear a ligament while severely stressing a joint. • Sprains often occur in the following circumstances: Ankle — Walking or exercising on an uneven surface, landing awkwardly from a jump Knee — Pivoting during an athletic activity Wrist — Landing on an outstretched hand during a fall Thumb — Skiing injury or overextension when playing racquet sports, such as tennis Children have areas of softer tissue, called growth plates, near the ends of their bones. • The ligaments around a joint are often stronger than these growth plates, so children are more likely to experience a fracture than a sprain.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors contributing to sprains include: Environmental conditions. • Slippery or uneven surfaces can make you more prone to injury. • Fatigue. • Tired muscles are less likely to provide good support for your joints. • When you're tired, you're also more likely to succumb to forces that could stress a joint. • Poor equipment. • Ill-fitting or poorly maintained footwear or other sporting equipment can contribute to your risk of a sprain.",
      "Prevention": "Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport, fitness or work activity, as part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of sprains. • Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. • If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries. • You can protect your joints in the long term by working to strengthen and condition the muscles around the joint that has been injured. • The best brace you can give yourself is your own \"muscle brace.\" Ask your doctor about appropriate conditioning and stability exercises. • Also, use footwear that offers support and protection."

      "Overview": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the skin. • It starts in cells called squamous cells. • The squamous cells make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. • Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer. • Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. • But if it's not treated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. • The growth of the cancer can cause serious complications. • Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation. • UV radiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps. • Protecting your skin from UV light can help reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and other forms of skin cancer. • Squamous cell carcinomas can be anywhere on the skin. • In people who sunburn easily, the cancer is usually found on areas of skin that have had a lot of sun. • In people with Black and brown skin, squamous cell carcinomas are more likely to be on skin that isn't exposed to sun, such as the genitals.",
      "Symptoms": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun-exposed skin. • This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips. • But it can occur anywhere on the body. • It can even occur inside the mouth, on the bottoms of the feet or on the genitals. • When squamous cell carcinoma of the skin happens in people with Black and brown skin, it tends to happen in places that aren't exposed to the sun. • Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include: A firm bump on the skin, called a nodule. • The nodule might be the same color as the skin, or it might look different. • It can look pink, red, black or brown, depending on skin color. • A flat sore with a scaly crust. • A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore. • A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore. • A sore or rough patch inside the mouth. • A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals. • Make an appointment with a health care professional for a sore or scab that doesn't heal in about two months or a flat patch of scaly skin that won't go away. • Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occurs when the squamous cells in the skin get changes in their DNA. • Cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell cells what to do. • The changes tell the squamous cells to multiply quickly. • The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This causes too many cells. • The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes most of the DNA changes in skin cells. • UV radiation can come from sunlight, tanning lamps and tanning beds. • But skin cancers also can grow on skin that's not usually in sunlight. • This means that other factors might add to the risk of skin cancer. • One such factor might be having a condition that weakens the immune system. • Factors that can increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include: Having skin that sunburns easily. • Anyone of any skin color can get squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • But it's more common in people who have low levels of melanin in their skin. • Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. • It also helps protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. • People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than people with white skin. • The risk of squamous cell carcinoma is highest in people who have blond or red hair, have light-colored eyes and freckle or sunburn easily. • Being in the sun too much. • UV radiation from the sun increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Covering the skin with clothes or sunblock can help lower the risk. • Using tanning beds. • People who use indoor tanning beds have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Having a history of sunburns. • Having had one or more sunburns that raised blisters as a child or teenager increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as an adult. • Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor. • Having a history of precancerous skin lesions. • Some types of skin sores can turn into skin cancer. • Examples are actinic keratosis or Bowen disease. • Having one of these conditions increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. • Having a history of skin cancer. • People who've had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin once are much more likely to get it again. • Having a weakened immune system. • People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer. • This includes people who have leukemia or lymphoma. • And it includes those who take medicines to control the immune system, such as those who have had organ transplants. • Having a rare genetic disorder. • People with xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes great sensitivity to sunlight, have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer. • Having human papillomavirus infection (HPV). • This common infection that's passed through sexual contact increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Having scars or long-lasting wounds on the skin. • Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can form in scars, burns and sores that don't heal. • Untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can destroy nearby healthy tissue. • It can spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. • And it can be fatal, although this is not common. • The risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin spreading may be higher if the cancer: Grows very large or deep. • Involves the mucous membranes, such as the lips. • Occurs in a person with a weakened immune system. • Examples of things that might cause a weakened immune system include having chronic leukemia or taking medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant. • Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be prevented. • To protect yourself: Stay out of the sun during the middle of the day. • For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. • Plan outdoor activities at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. • When outside, stay in shade as much as possible. • Wear sunscreen year-round. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously. • Apply again every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Wear protective clothing. • Wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover arms and legs. • Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades your face and ears. • Don't forget sunglasses. • Look for those that block both types of UV radiation, UVA and UVB rays. • Don't use tanning beds. • The lights in tanning beds give off UV radiation. • Using tanning beds increases the risk of skin cancer. • Check your skin often and report changes to your health care team. • Look at your skin often for new growths. • Look for changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. • Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp. • Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. • Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. • Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. • Also check your genital area and between your buttocks.",

      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include: Having skin that sunburns easily. • Anyone of any skin color can get squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • But it's more common in people who have low levels of melanin in their skin. • Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. • It also helps protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. • People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than people with white skin. • The risk of squamous cell carcinoma is highest in people who have blond or red hair, have light-colored eyes and freckle or sunburn easily. • Being in the sun too much. • UV radiation from the sun increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Covering the skin with clothes or sunblock can help lower the risk. • Using tanning beds. • People who use indoor tanning beds have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Having a history of sunburns. • Having had one or more sunburns that raised blisters as a child or teenager increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as an adult. • Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor. • Having a history of precancerous skin lesions. • Some types of skin sores can turn into skin cancer. • Examples are actinic keratosis or Bowen disease. • Having one of these conditions increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. • Having a history of skin cancer. • People who've had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin once are much more likely to get it again. • Having a weakened immune system. • People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer. • This includes people who have leukemia or lymphoma. • And it includes those who take medicines to control the immune system, such as those who have had organ transplants. • Having a rare genetic disorder. • People with xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes great sensitivity to sunlight, have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer. • Having human papillomavirus infection (HPV). • This common infection that's passed through sexual contact increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. • Having scars or long-lasting wounds on the skin. • Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can form in scars, burns and sores that don't heal.",
      "Complications": "Untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can destroy nearby healthy tissue. • It can spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. • And it can be fatal, although this is not common. • The risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin spreading may be higher if the cancer: Grows very large or deep. • Involves the mucous membranes, such as the lips. • Occurs in a person with a weakened immune system. • Examples of things that might cause a weakened immune system include having chronic leukemia or taking medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant.",
      "Prevention": "Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be prevented. • To protect yourself: Stay out of the sun during the middle of the day. • For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. • Plan outdoor activities at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. • When outside, stay in shade as much as possible. • Wear sunscreen year-round. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously. • Apply again every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Wear protective clothing. • Wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover arms and legs. • Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades your face and ears. • Don't forget sunglasses. • Look for those that block both types of UV radiation, UVA and UVB rays. • Don't use tanning beds. • The lights in tanning beds give off UV radiation. • Using tanning beds increases the risk of skin cancer. • Check your skin often and report changes to your health care team. • Look at your skin often for new growths. • Look for changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. • Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp. • Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. • Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. • Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. • Also check your genital area and between your buttocks."

      "Overview": "Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. • The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. • The stomach helps to break down and digest food. • Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. • In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. • This part is called the stomach body. • In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. • This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. • The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus. • Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. • Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. • Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. • Other treatments may be used before and after surgery. • Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. • The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. • Many can expect to be cured. • Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. • Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: Trouble swallowing Belly pain Feeling bloated after eating Feeling full after eating small amounts of food Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry Heartburn Indigestion Nausea Vomiting Losing weight without trying Feeling very tired Stools that look black Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. • When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. • Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. • Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. • Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. • It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. • For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. • Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. • If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. • The belly might look swollen. • If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider. • Many conditions can cause symptoms that are like the ones caused by stomach cancer. • Your provider might test for those other causes first before testing for stomach cancer. • It's not clear what causes stomach cancer. • Experts believe most stomach cancers start when something hurts the inside lining of the stomach. • Examples include having an infection in the stomach, having long-standing acid reflux and eating a lot of salty foods. • Not everyone with these risk factors gets stomach cancer, though. • So more research is needed to find out exactly what causes it. • Stomach cancer begins when something hurts cells in the inner lining of the stomach. • It causes the cells to develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. • The cells can go on living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle. • This causes a lot of extra cells in the stomach. • The cells can form a mass called a tumor. • Cancer cells in the stomach can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • They might start to grow deeper into the wall of the stomach. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer cells spread to another part of the body it's called metastasis. • The type of stomach cancer you have is based on the type of cell where your cancer began. • Examples of stomach cancer types include: Adenocarcinoma. • Adenocarcinoma stomach cancer starts in cells that produce mucus. • This is the most common type of stomach cancer. • Nearly all cancers that start in the stomach are adenocarcinoma stomach cancers. • Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). • GIST starts in special nerve cells that are found in the wall of the stomach and other digestive organs. • GIST is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. • Carcinoid tumors. • Carcinoid tumors are cancers that start in the neuroendocrine cells. • Neuroendocrine cells are found in many places in the body. • They do some nerve cell functions and some of the work of cells that make hormones. • Carcinoid tumors are a type of neuroendocrine tumor. • Lymphoma. • Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in immune system cells. • The body's immune system fights germs. • Lymphoma can sometimes start in the stomach if the body sends immune system cells to the stomach. • This might happen if the body is trying to fight off an infection. • Most lymphomas that start in the stomach are a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. • Factors that increase the risk of stomach cancer include: Ongoing problems with stomach acid backing up into the esophagus, which is called gastroesophageal reflux disease A diet high in salty and smoked foods A diet low in fruits and vegetables Infection in the stomach caused by a germ called Helicobacter pylori Swelling and irritation of the inside of the stomach, which is called gastritis Smoking Growths of noncancerous cells in the stomach, called polyps Family history of stomach cancer Family history of genetic syndromes that increase the risk of stomach cancer and other cancers, such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis To lower the risk of stomach cancer, you can: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. • Try to include fruits and vegetables in your diet each day. • Choose a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. • Reduce the amount of salty and smoked foods you eat. • Protect your stomach by limiting these foods. • Stop smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • If you don't smoke, don't start. • Smoking increases your risk of stomach cancer and many other types of cancer. • Quitting smoking can be very hard, so ask your health care provider for help. • Tell your health care provider if stomach cancer runs in your family. • People with a strong family history of stomach cancer might have stomach cancer screening. • Screening tests can detect stomach cancer before it causes symptoms.",

      "Symptoms": "If you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you: Cough or sneeze. • Laugh. • Bend over. • Lift something heavy. • Exercise. • Have sex. • You might not leak urine every time you do one of these things. • But any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make leaking more likely. • Having a full bladder increases the chances of leaking. • Talk to your healthcare professional if your symptoms bother you or get in the way of daily activities like work, hobbies and social life. • Stress incontinence happens when certain muscles and other tissues linked to urinating weaken. • These include the muscles that support the urethra, called the pelvic floor muscles, and the muscles that control the release of urine, called the urinary sphincter. • The bladder expands as it fills with urine. • Most often, valve-like muscles in the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra, stay closed as the bladder expands. • This keeps you from leaking urine until you reach a bathroom. • But when those muscles weaken, anything that puts force on the stomach and pelvic muscles put pressure on your bladder. • Sneezing, bending over, lifting or laughing hard, for instance, can cause urine leakage. • In people assigned female at birth, the pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter may lose strength because of: Childbirth. • Tissue or nerve damage during delivery of a child can weaken the pelvic floor muscles or the sphincter. • Stress incontinence from this damage may begin soon after delivery or happen years later. • In people assigned male at birth, the pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter may lose strength because of: Prostate surgery. • Treatment for prostate cancer often involves surgery to remove the prostate gland, called a prostatectomy. • This surgery is the most common factor leading to stress incontinence. • This procedure can weaken the sphincter, which lies right below the prostate gland and goes around the urethra. • Other factors that can make stress incontinence worse for males and females include: Illnesses that cause chronic coughing. • Obesity. • Factors that increase the risk of getting stress incontinence include: Age. • Physical changes that happen with age, such as muscles getting weaker, may make you more likely to get stress incontinence. • But some stress incontinence can happen at any age. • Body weight. • People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of stress incontinence. • Excess weight increases pressure on the abdominal and pelvic organs. • For females, risks factors also include: Type of childbirth delivery. • People who've had a vaginal delivery are more likely to have urinary incontinence than are those who had a cesarean section. • Having more than one child also raises the risk. • Complications of stress incontinence may include: Emotional upset. • If you have stress incontinence, you may feel embarrassed. • It can disrupt your work, social life, relationships and even your sex life. • Some people are ashamed that they need pads or incontinence garments. • Mixed urinary incontinence. • It's common to have both stress incontinence and urgency incontinence. • Urinary incontinence results when bladder muscles tighten and cause an urgent need to urinate. • People with this condition may have frequent urination, urination in the evening and urgency to urinate with or without associated incontinence. • This is called overactive bladder. • Skin rash or soreness. • Prolonged contact with urine can cause skin to be sore or to break down. • This can happen with severe incontinence if you don't use moisture barriers or incontinence pads. • Change pads often and use continence pads rather than menstrual pads to prevent skin sores.",

      "Overview": "An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or reduced. • This prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. • Brain cells begin to die in minutes. • Another type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke. • It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding in the brain. • The blood increases pressure on brain cells and damages them. • A stroke is a medical emergency. • It's crucial to get medical treatment right away. • Getting emergency medical help quickly can reduce brain damage and other stroke complications. • The good news is that fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. • Effective treatments also can help prevent disability from stroke.",
      "Symptoms": "If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay attention to the time the symptoms began. • Some treatments are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins. • Symptoms of stroke include: Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. • A person having a stroke may be confused, slur words or may not be able to understand speech. • Numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. • This often affects just one side of the body. • The person can try to raise both arms over the head. • If one arm begins to fall, it may be a sign of a stroke. • Also, one side of the mouth may droop when trying to smile. • Problems seeing in one or both eyes. • The person may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes. • Or the person may see double. • Headache. • A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke. • Vomiting, dizziness and a change in consciousness may occur with the headache. • Trouble walking. • Someone having a stroke may stumble or lose balance or coordination. • Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to come and go or they disappear completely. • Think \"FAST\" and do the following: Face. • Ask the person to smile. • Does one side of the face droop? Arms. • Ask the person to raise both arms. • Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise? Speech. • Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. • Is the person's speech slurred or different from usual? Time. • If you see any of these signs, call 911 or emergency medical help right away. • Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Don't wait to see if symptoms stop. • Every minute counts. • The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. • If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance. • There are two main causes of stroke. • An ischemic stroke is caused by a blocked artery in the brain. • A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by leaking or bursting of a blood vessel in the brain. • Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). • A TIA doesn't cause lasting symptoms. • This is the most common type of stroke. • It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked. • This causes reduced blood flow, known as ischemia. • Blocked or narrowed blood vessels can be caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels. • Or they can be caused by blood clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream, most often from the heart. • An ischemic stroke occurs when fatty deposits, blood clots or other debris become lodged in the blood vessels in the brain. • Some early research shows that COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of ischemic stroke, but more study is needed. • Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. • Bleeding inside the brain, known as a brain hemorrhage, can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels. • Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include: High blood pressure that's not under control. • Overtreatment with blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants. • Bulges at weak spots in the blood vessel walls, known as aneurysms. • Head trauma, such as from a car accident. • Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall. • This is known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. • Ischemic stroke that leads to a brain hemorrhage. • A less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). • An AVM is an irregular tangle of thin-walled blood vessels. • A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. • But a TIA doesn't cause permanent damage. • A TIA is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain. • The decrease may last as little as five minutes. • A transient ischemic attack is sometimes known as a ministroke. • A TIA occurs when a blood clot or fatty deposit reduces or blocks blood flow to part of the nervous system. • Seek emergency care even if you think you've had a TIA. • It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or TIA based only on the symptoms. • If you've had a TIA, it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to the brain. • Having a TIA increases your risk of having a stroke later. • Many factors can increase the risk of stroke. • Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Being overweight or obese. • Physical inactivity. • Heavy or binge drinking. • Use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. • High blood pressure. • Cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure. • High cholesterol. • Diabetes. • Obstructive sleep apnea. • Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or irregular heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation. • Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack. • COVID-19 infection. • Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include: Age — People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people. • Race or ethnicity — African American and Hispanic people have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities. • Sex — Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. • Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men. • Hormones — Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk. • A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities. • Complications depend on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part is affected. • Complications may include: Loss of muscle movement, known as paralysis. • You may become paralyzed on one side of the body. • Or you may lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of the face or one arm. • Trouble talking or swallowing. • A stroke might affect the muscles in the mouth and throat. • This can make it hard to talk clearly, swallow or eat. • You also may have trouble with language, including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing. • Memory loss or trouble thinking. • Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. • Others may have trouble thinking, reasoning, making judgments and understanding concepts. • Emotional symptoms. • People who have had strokes may have more trouble controlling their emotions. • Or they may develop depression. • Pain. • Pain, numbness or other feelings may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke. • If a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm, you may develop a tingling sensation in that arm. • Changes in behavior and self-care. • People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn. • They also may need help with grooming and daily chores. • You can take steps to prevent a stroke. • It's important to know your stroke risk factors and follow the advice of your healthcare professional about healthy lifestyle strategies. • If you've had a stroke, these measures might help prevent another stroke. • If you have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), these steps can help lower your risk of a stroke. • The follow-up care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role. • Many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart disease. • In general, healthy lifestyle recommendations include: Control high blood pressure, known as hypertension. • This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk. • If you've had a stroke, lowering your blood pressure can help prevent a TIA or stroke in the future. • Healthy lifestyle changes and medicines often are used to treat high blood pressure. • Lower the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet. • Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fats and trans fats, may reduce buildup in the arteries. • If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, you may need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. • Quit tobacco use. • Smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke. • Quitting lowers your risk of stroke. • Manage diabetes. • Diet, exercise and losing weight can help you keep your blood sugar in a healthy range. • If lifestyle factors aren't enough to control blood sugar, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. • Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. • Eating five or more servings of fruits or vegetables every day may reduce the risk of stroke. • The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes olive oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables and whole grains, may be helpful. • Exercise regularly. • Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways. • Exercise can lower blood pressure, increase the levels of good cholesterol, and improve the overall health of the blood vessels and heart. • It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress. • Gradually work up to at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most or all days of the week. • The American Heart association recommends getting 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. • Moderate intensity activities can include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol increases the risk of high blood pressure, ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. • Alcohol also may interact with other medicines you're taking. • However, drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease the blood's clotting tendency. • A small to moderate amount is about one drink a day. • Talk to your healthcare professional about what's appropriate for you. • Treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). • OSA is a sleep disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short periods several times during sleep. • Your healthcare professional may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of OSA. • Treatment includes a device that delivers positive airway pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while you sleep. • Don't use illicit drugs. • Certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are established risk factors for a TIA or a stroke. • If you have had an ischemic stroke, you may need medicines to help lower your risk of having another stroke. • If you have had a TIA, medicines can lower your risk of having a stroke in the future. • These medicines may include: Anti-platelet drugs. • Platelets are cells in the blood that form clots. • Anti-platelet medicines make these cells less sticky and less likely to clot. • The most commonly used anti-platelet medicine is aspirin. • Your healthcare professional can recommend the right dose of aspirin for you. • If you've had a TIA or minor stroke, you may take both an aspirin and an anti-platelet medicine such as clopidogrel (Plavix). • These medicines may be prescribed for a period of time to reduce the risk of another stroke. • If you can't take aspirin, you may be prescribed clopidogrel alone. • Ticagrelor (Brilinta) is another anti-platelet medicine that can be used for stroke prevention. • Blooding-thinning medicines, known as anticoagulants. • These medicines reduce blood clotting. • Heparin is a fast-acting anticoagulant that may be used short-term in the hospital. • Slower acting warfarin (Jantoven) may be used over a longer term. • Warfarin is a powerful blood-thinning medicine, so you need to take it exactly as directed and watch for side effects. • You also need regular blood tests to monitor warfarin's effects. • Several newer blood-thinning medicines are available to prevent strokes in people who have a high risk. • These medicines include dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis) and edoxaban (Savaysa). • They work faster than warfarin and usually don't require regular blood tests or monitoring by your healthcare professional. • These medicines also are associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to warfarin.",
      "Causes": "There are two main causes of stroke. • An ischemic stroke is caused by a blocked artery in the brain. • A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by leaking or bursting of a blood vessel in the brain. • Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). • A TIA doesn't cause lasting symptoms. • This is the most common type of stroke. • It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked. • This causes reduced blood flow, known as ischemia. • Blocked or narrowed blood vessels can be caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels. • Or they can be caused by blood clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream, most often from the heart. • An ischemic stroke occurs when fatty deposits, blood clots or other debris become lodged in the blood vessels in the brain. • Some early research shows that COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of ischemic stroke, but more study is needed. • Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. • Bleeding inside the brain, known as a brain hemorrhage, can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels. • Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include: High blood pressure that's not under control. • Overtreatment with blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants. • Bulges at weak spots in the blood vessel walls, known as aneurysms. • Head trauma, such as from a car accident. • Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall. • This is known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. • Ischemic stroke that leads to a brain hemorrhage. • A less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). • An AVM is an irregular tangle of thin-walled blood vessels. • A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. • But a TIA doesn't cause permanent damage. • A TIA is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain. • The decrease may last as little as five minutes. • A transient ischemic attack is sometimes known as a ministroke. • A TIA occurs when a blood clot or fatty deposit reduces or blocks blood flow to part of the nervous system. • Seek emergency care even if you think you've had a TIA. • It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or TIA based only on the symptoms. • If you've had a TIA, it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to the brain. • Having a TIA increases your risk of having a stroke later.",
      "Risk factors": "Many factors can increase the risk of stroke. • Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include: Being overweight or obese. • Physical inactivity. • Heavy or binge drinking. • Use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. • High blood pressure. • Cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure. • High cholesterol. • Diabetes. • Obstructive sleep apnea. • Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or irregular heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation. • Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack. • COVID-19 infection. • Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include: Age — People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people. • Race or ethnicity — African American and Hispanic people have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities. • Sex — Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. • Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men. • Hormones — Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk.",
      "Complications": "A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities. • Complications depend on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part is affected. • Complications may include: Loss of muscle movement, known as paralysis. • You may become paralyzed on one side of the body. • Or you may lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of the face or one arm. • Trouble talking or swallowing. • A stroke might affect the muscles in the mouth and throat. • This can make it hard to talk clearly, swallow or eat. • You also may have trouble with language, including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing. • Memory loss or trouble thinking. • Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. • Others may have trouble thinking, reasoning, making judgments and understanding concepts. • Emotional symptoms. • People who have had strokes may have more trouble controlling their emotions. • Or they may develop depression. • Pain. • Pain, numbness or other feelings may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke. • If a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm, you may develop a tingling sensation in that arm. • Changes in behavior and self-care. • People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn. • They also may need help with grooming and daily chores.",
      "Prevention": "You can take steps to prevent a stroke. • It's important to know your stroke risk factors and follow the advice of your healthcare professional about healthy lifestyle strategies. • If you've had a stroke, these measures might help prevent another stroke. • If you have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), these steps can help lower your risk of a stroke. • The follow-up care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role. • Many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart disease. • In general, healthy lifestyle recommendations include: Control high blood pressure, known as hypertension. • This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk. • If you've had a stroke, lowering your blood pressure can help prevent a TIA or stroke in the future. • Healthy lifestyle changes and medicines often are used to treat high blood pressure. • Lower the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet. • Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fats and trans fats, may reduce buildup in the arteries. • If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, you may need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. • Quit tobacco use. • Smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke. • Quitting lowers your risk of stroke. • Manage diabetes. • Diet, exercise and losing weight can help you keep your blood sugar in a healthy range. • If lifestyle factors aren't enough to control blood sugar, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. • Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. • Eating five or more servings of fruits or vegetables every day may reduce the risk of stroke. • The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes olive oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables and whole grains, may be helpful. • Exercise regularly. • Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways. • Exercise can lower blood pressure, increase the levels of good cholesterol, and improve the overall health of the blood vessels and heart. • It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress. • Gradually work up to at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most or all days of the week. • The American Heart association recommends getting 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. • Moderate intensity activities can include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol increases the risk of high blood pressure, ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. • Alcohol also may interact with other medicines you're taking. • However, drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease the blood's clotting tendency. • A small to moderate amount is about one drink a day. • Talk to your healthcare professional about what's appropriate for you. • Treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). • OSA is a sleep disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short periods several times during sleep. • Your healthcare professional may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of OSA. • Treatment includes a device that delivers positive airway pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while you sleep. • Don't use illicit drugs. • Certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are established risk factors for a TIA or a stroke. • If you have had an ischemic stroke, you may need medicines to help lower your risk of having another stroke. • If you have had a TIA, medicines

      "Overview": "Stuttering is a speech condition that disrupts the normal flow of speech. • Fluency means having an easy and smooth flow and rhythm when speaking. • With stuttering, the interruptions in flow happen often and cause problems for the speaker. • Other names for stuttering are stammering and childhood-onset fluency disorder. • People who stutter know what they want to say, but they have a hard time saying it. • For example, they may repeat or stretch out a word, a syllable, or a consonant or vowel sound. • Or they may pause during speech because they've reached a word or sound that's hard to get out. • Stuttering is common among young children as a usual part of learning to speak. • Some young children may stutter when their speech and language abilities aren't developed enough to keep up with what they want to say. • Most children outgrow this type of stuttering, called developmental stuttering. • But sometimes stuttering is a long-term condition that remains into adulthood. • This type of stuttering can affect self-esteem and communicating with other people. • Children and adults who stutter may be helped by treatments such as speech therapy, electronic devices to improve speech fluency or a form of mental health therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Stuttering symptoms may include: Having a hard time starting a word, phrase or sentence. • Stretching out a word or sounds within a word. • Repeating a sound, syllable or word. • Brief silence for certain syllables or words, or pausing before or within a word. • Adding extra words such as \"um\" if expecting to have problems moving to the next word. • A lot of tension, tightness or movement of the face or upper body when saying a word. • Anxiety about talking. • Not being able to communicate well with others. • These actions may happen when stuttering: Rapid eye blinks. • Trembling of the lips or jaw. • Unusual face movements, sometimes called facial tics. • Head nodding. • Tightening of fists. • Stuttering may be worse when the person is excited, tired or under stress, or when feeling self-conscious, hurried or pressured. • Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone can be especially hard for people who stutter. • But most people who stutter can speak without stuttering when they talk to themselves and when they sing or speak along with someone else. • It's common for children between the ages of 2 and 5 years to go through periods when they may stutter. • For most children, this is part of learning to speak, and it gets better on its own. • But stuttering that continues may need treatment to improve speech fluency. • Call your healthcare professional for a referral to a specialist in speech and language called a speech-language pathologist. • Or you can contact the speech-language pathologist directly for an appointment. • Ask for help if stuttering: Lasts more than six months. • Happens along with other speech or language problems. • Happens more often or continues as the child grows older. • Includes muscle tightening or physically struggling when trying to speak. • Affects the ability to effectively communicate at school or work or in social situations. • Causes anxiety or emotional problems, such as fear of or not taking part in situations that require speaking. • Begins as an adult.",
      "Causes": "Researchers continue to study the underlying causes of developmental stuttering. • A combination of factors may be involved. • Stuttering that happens in children while they're learning to speak is called developmental stuttering. • Possible causes of developmental stuttering include: Problems with speech motor control. • Some evidence shows that problems in speech motor control, such as timing, sensory and motor coordination, may be involved. • Genetics. • Stuttering tends to run in families. • It appears that stuttering can happen from changes in genes passed down from parents to children. • Speech fluency can be disrupted from causes other than developmental stuttering. • Neurogenic stuttering. • A stroke, traumatic brain injury or other brain disorders can cause speech that is slow or has pauses or repeated sounds. • Emotional distress. • Speech fluency can be disrupted during times of emotional distress. • Speakers who usually do not stutter may experience problems with fluency when they are nervous or feel pressured. • These situations also may cause speakers who stutter to have greater problems with fluency. • Psychogenic stuttering. • Speech difficulties that appear after an emotional trauma are uncommon and not the same as developmental stuttering.",
      "Risk factors": "Males are much more likely to stutter than females are. • Things that raise the risk of stuttering include: Having a childhood developmental condition. • Children who have developmental conditions, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism or developmental delays, may be more likely to stutter. • This is true for children with other speech problems too. • Having relatives who stutter. • Stuttering tends to run in families. • Stress. • Stress in the family and other types of stress or pressure can worsen existing stuttering.",
      "Complications": "Stuttering can lead to: Problems communicating with others. • Not speaking or staying away from situations that require speaking. • Not taking part in social, school or work activities and opportunities for success. • Being bullied or teased. • Low self-esteem."

      "Overview": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. • Breathing stops. • The person becomes unconscious. • Without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death. • Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). • Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care. • Sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. • A heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. • Sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. • However, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include: Sudden collapse. • No pulse. • No breathing. • Loss of consciousness. • Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. • These might include: Chest discomfort. • Shortness of breath. • Weakness. • Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heartbeat called palpitations. • But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning. • When the heart stops, the lack of oxygen-rich blood can quickly cause death or permanent brain damage. • Call 911 or emergency medical services for these symptoms: Chest pain or discomfort. • Feeling of a pounding heartbeat. • Rapid or irregular heartbeats. • Unexplained wheezing. • Shortness of breath. • Fainting or near fainting. • Lightheadedness or dizziness. • If you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing, call 911 or local emergency services. • Then start CPR. • The American Heart Association recommends doing CPR with hard and fast chest compressions. • Use an automated external defibrillator, called an AED, if one is available. • Do CPR if the person isn't breathing. • Push hard and fast on the person's chest — about 100 to 120 pushes a minute. • The pushes are called compressions. • If you've been trained in CPR, check the person's airway. • Then deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. • If you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. • Allow the chest to rise completely between each push. • Keep doing this until an AED is available or emergency workers arrive. • Portable automated external defibrillators, called AEDs, are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. • You also can buy one for home use. • AEDs come with voice instructions for their use. • They're programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate. • A change in the heart's electrical activity causes sudden cardiac arrest. • The change makes the heart stop pumping blood. • No blood flow goes to the body. • To understand sudden cardiac arrest, it may help to know more about the heart's signaling system. • Electric signals in the heart control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. • Faulty or extra electrical signals can make the heart beat too fast, too slowly or in an uncoordinated way. • Changes in the heartbeat are called arrhythmias. • Some arrhythmias are brief and harmless. • Others can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. • The most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation. • Rapid, erratic heart signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. • Some heart conditions can make you more likely to have this type of irregular heartbeat. • However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who have no known heart disease. • Heart conditions that can cause sudden cardiac arrest include: Coronary artery disease. • Sudden cardiac arrest may occur if the heart arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to the heart. • Heart attack. • If a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. • Also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart. • The scar tissue can cause changes in the heartbeat. • Enlarged heart called cardiomyopathy. • This condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch. • The heart muscle gets bigger or thicker. • Heart valve disease. • Leaking or narrowing of the heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of the heart muscle. • When the chambers get larger or weak because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing an irregular heartbeat. • Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Sudden cardiac arrest in children or adolescents is often due to a heart condition that they're born with. • Adults who've had repair surgery for a congenital heart defect also have an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. • Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and other heart signaling conditions. • Conditions such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome cause the heart to beat in an unorganized way. • If the heart rhythm isn't quickly restored, sudden death can occur. • Young people with LQTS are especially at risk of sudden death. • The same things that increase the risk of heart disease can raise the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. • These include: A family history of coronary artery disease. • Smoking. • High blood pressure. • High blood cholesterol. • Obesity. • Diabetes. • An inactive lifestyle. • Other things that might increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest include: A previous episode of sudden cardiac arrest or a family history of it. • A previous heart attack. • A personal or family history of other forms of heart disease such as heart rhythm disease, heart failure and heart conditions present at birth. • Growing older. • Being male. • Using illicit drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines. • Low potassium or magnesium levels. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Chronic kidney disease. • When sudden cardiac arrest occurs, less blood flows to the brain. • If the heart rhythm isn't rapidly restored, complications may include brain damage and death. • Keeping the heart healthy may help prevent sudden cardiac arrest. • Take these steps: Eat healthy. • Stay active and get regular exercise. • Do not smoke or use tobacco. • Have regular checkups. • Get screened for heart disease. • Control blood pressure and cholesterol. • Genetic tests can be done to see if you have long QT syndrome, a common cause of sudden cardiac death. • Check with your insurer to see if it is covered. • If you have the long QT gene, your healthcare professional may recommend that other family members also be tested. • If you have a known risk of cardiac arrest, your healthcare professional might recommend a heart device called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). • The device is placed under your collarbone. • You also might consider purchasing an automated external defibrillator (AED) for home use. • Discuss this with your healthcare team. • AEDs help reset the heart's rhythm when a person has sudden cardiac arrest. • But they can be expensive

      "Overview": "Sudden infant death syndrome is the unexplained death of a baby. • The baby is usually less than a year old and seems to be healthy. • It often happens during sleep. • Sudden infant death syndrome also is known as SIDS. • It is sometimes called crib death because infants often die in their cribs. • The cause of SIDS is unknown. • But it may be caused by problems in the area of an infant's brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep. • Researchers have found some things that might put babies at higher risk. • They've also found some things you can do to help protect your child from SIDS. • The most important action may be to place a baby on the back to sleep.",
      "Causes": "Both physical and sleep factors put an infant at risk of SIDS. • These factors vary from child to child. • Physical factors associated with SIDS include: Brain defects. • Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS. • In many of these babies, the part of the brain that controls breathing and waking up from sleep hasn't developed enough to work properly. • Low birth weight. • Being born early or being part of a multiple birth increases the chances that a baby's brain hasn't fully developed at birth. • The baby may have less control over such automatic processes as breathing and heart rate. • Respiratory infection. • Many infants who died of SIDS had recently had a cold. • A cold may lead to breathing problems. • A baby's sleeping position, items in the crib and other conditions may increase the risk of SIDS. • Examples include: Sleeping on the stomach or side. • Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more trouble breathing than those placed on their backs. • Sleeping on a soft surface. • Lying face down on a fluffy comforter, a soft mattress or a waterbed can block an infant's airway. • Sharing a bed. • The risk of SIDS rises if a baby sleeps in the same bed with parents, siblings or pets. • But it may help if the infant sleeps in a separate bed in the same room with parents. • That seems to lower the risk of SIDS. • Overheating. • Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS.",
      "Risk factors": "SIDS can happen to any infant. • But researchers have found several factors that might raise the risk. • They include: Sex. • Boys are slightly more likely than girls to die of SIDS. • Age. • Infants are at higher risk between the second and fourth months of life. • Race. • For reasons that aren't well understood, SIDS occurs more often in Black, Native American and Alaska Native infants. • Family history. • Babies with siblings who died of SIDS are at higher risk of SIDS. • Secondhand smoke. • Babies who live with smokers have a higher risk of SIDS. • Premature birth. • Being born early and having a low birth weight increase a baby's chances of SIDS. • During pregnancy, mothers also affect their babies' risk of SIDS, especially if they: Are younger than 20. • Smoke cigarettes. • Use drugs or alcohol. • Do not receive good medical care while pregnant.",
      "Prevention": "There's no definite way to prevent SIDS. • But you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips: Back to sleep. • Place your baby to sleep in the correct position — on the back. • Be sure to use the back position every time you or anyone else puts your baby to sleep for the first year of life. • Don't trust that others will place your baby to sleep in the correct position: Insist on it. • This won't be needed once your baby can roll over both ways without help. • Don't put your baby on the stomach or side to sleep. • Advise a caregiver to only use the stomach position when the baby and caregiver are both in the same room and both are awake. • Short periods of \"tummy time\" help a baby build muscle strength. • But the baby should never be left alone during tummy time. • Keep the crib as bare as possible. • Use a firm, flat mattress. • Make sure the mattress does not sit at an angle higher than 10 degrees. • Avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt. • Don't leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib. • They can cause problems with breathing if your baby's face presses against them. • Don't overheat your baby. • To keep your baby warm, try a sleep sack. • Or dress your baby in layers instead of using blankets. • Don't cover your baby's head. • Have your baby sleep in your room. • If possible, your baby should sleep in your room with you, but not in the same bed. • Have your baby sleep alone in a crib or bassinet with a mattress designed for infant bedding. • Your baby should sleep in the same room with you for at least six months. • Adult beds aren't safe for infants. • A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats. • Those are the spaces between the mattress and the bed frame. • A baby also can get trapped in the space between the mattress and the wall. • And a baby can suffocate if a sleeping parent accidentally rolls over and covers the baby's nose and mouth. • Breastfeed your baby, if possible. • Breastfeeding for at least six months to a year lowers the risk of SIDS. • Don't use baby monitors and other commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. • The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of monitors and other devices. • These devices do not prevent SIDS. • And they cannot be used instead of safe sleep practices. • Offer a pacifier. • Sucking on a pacifier at nap time or bedtime may reduce the risk of SIDS. • Make sure the pacifier does not have a strap or cord. • If you're breastfeeding, wait to offer a pacifier until you and your baby have settled into a nursing routine. • It usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to set up a nursing routine. • If your baby is not interested in the pacifier, don't force it. • Try again another day. • If the pacifier falls out while your baby is sleeping, don't put it back in. • Vaccinate your baby. • There's no evidence that recommended shots to protect against diseases increase the risk of SIDS. • Some evidence shows that such shots may help prevent SIDS."

      "Overview": "Suicide, taking your own life, is a tragic reaction to stressful life situations — and all the more tragic because suicide can be prevented. • Whether you're considering suicide or know someone who feels suicidal, learn suicide warning signs and how to reach out for immediate help and professional treatment. • You may save a life — your own or someone else's. • It may seem like there's no way to solve your problems and that suicide is the only way to end the pain. • But you can take steps to stay safe — and start enjoying your life again.",
      "Symptoms": "Suicide warning signs or suicidal thoughts include: Talking about suicide — for example, making statements such as \"I'm going to kill myself,\" \"I wish I were dead\" or \"I wish I hadn't been born\" Getting the means to take your own life, such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone Having mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next Being preoccupied with death, dying or violence Feeling trapped or hopeless about a situation Increasing use of alcohol or drugs Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns Doing risky or self-destructive things, such as using drugs or driving recklessly Giving away belongings or getting affairs in order when there's no other logical explanation for doing this Saying goodbye to people as if they won't be seen again Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated, particularly when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above Warning signs aren't always obvious, and they may vary from person to person. • Some people make their intentions clear, while others keep suicidal thoughts and feelings secret. • If you're feeling suicidal, but you aren't immediately thinking of hurting yourself: Reach out to a close friend or loved one — even though it may be hard to talk about your feelings Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community Call a suicide hotline Make an appointment with your doctor, other health care provider or a mental health professional Suicidal thinking doesn't get better on its own — so get help.",
      "Causes": "Suicidal thoughts have many causes. • Most often, suicidal thoughts are the result of feeling like you can't cope when you're faced with what seems to be an overwhelming life situation. • If you don't have hope for the future, you may mistakenly think suicide is a solution. • You may experience a sort of tunnel vision, where in the middle of a crisis you believe suicide is the only way out. • There also may be a genetic link to suicide. • People who complete suicide or who have suicidal thoughts or behavior are more likely to have a family history of suicide.",
      "Risk factors": "Although attempted suicide is more frequent for women, men are more likely than women to complete suicide because they typically use more-lethal methods, such as a firearm. • You may be at risk of suicide if you: Attempted suicide before Feel hopeless, worthless, agitated, socially isolated or lonely Experience a stressful life event, such as the loss of a loved one, military service, a breakup, or financial or legal problems Have a substance abuse problem — alcohol and drug abuse can worsen thoughts of suicide and make you feel reckless or impulsive enough to act on your thoughts Have suicidal thoughts and have access to firearms in your home Have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder Have a family history of mental disorders, substance abuse, suicide, or violence, including physical or sexual abuse Have a medical condition that can be linked to depression and suicidal thinking, such as chronic disease, chronic pain or terminal illness Are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender with an unsupportive family or in a hostile environment Suicide in children and teenagers can follow stressful life events. • What a young person sees as serious and insurmountable may seem minor to an adult — such as problems in school or the loss of a friendship. • In some cases, a child or teen may feel suicidal due to certain life circumstances that he or she may not want to talk about, such as: Having a psychiatric disorder, including depression Loss or conflict with close friends or family members History of physical or sexual abuse Problems with alcohol or drugs Physical or medical issues, for example, becoming pregnant or having a sexually transmitted infection Being the victim of bullying Being uncertain of sexual orientation Reading or hearing an account of suicide or knowing a peer who died by suicide If you have concerns about a friend or family member, asking about suicidal thoughts and intentions is the best way to identify risk. • In rare cases, people who are suicidal are at risk of killing others and then themselves. • Known as a homicide-suicide or murder-suicide, some risk factors include: History of conflict with a spouse or romantic partner Current family legal or financial problems History of mental health problems, particularly depression Alcohol or drug abuse Having access to a firearm Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. • In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. • However, keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.",
      "Complications": "Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide take an emotional toll. • For instance, you may be so consumed by suicidal thoughts that you can't function in your daily life. • And while many attempted suicides are impulsive acts during a moment of crisis, they can leave you with permanent serious or severe injuries, such as organ failure or brain damage. • For those left behind after a suicide — people known as survivors of suicide — grief, anger, depression and guilt are common.",
      "Prevention": "To help keep yourself from feeling suicidal: Get the treatment you need. • If you don't treat the underlying cause, your suicidal thoughts are likely to return. • You may feel embarrassed to seek treatment for mental health problems, but getting the right treatment for depression, substance misuse or another underlying problem will make you feel better about life — and help keep you safe. • Establish your support network. • It may be hard to talk about suicidal feelings, and your friends and family may not fully understand why you feel the way you do. • Reach out anyway, and make sure the people who care about you know what's going on and are there when you need them. • You may also want to get help from your place of worship, support groups or other community resources. • Feeling connected and supported can help reduce suicide risk. • Remember, suicidal feelings are temporary. • If you feel hopeless or that life's not worth living anymore, remember that treatment can help you regain your perspective — and life will get better. • Take one step at a time and don't act impulsively."

      "Overview": "Sun allergy is a broad term. • It describes several conditions that cause an itchy rash to form on the skin after being in sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. • Polymorphous light eruption is the most common form of sun allergy. • Some people have a hereditary type of sun allergy. • Others develop symptoms only when triggered by another factor — such as taking medication or touching certain plants. • Other types of sun-related reactions occur for reasons that are unclear. • Mild sun allergy may clear up without treatment. • Severe rashes may be treated with steroid creams or pills. • If you have severe sun allergy, you may need to take preventive steps. • For example, wear clothing that shields you from the sun.",
      "Symptoms": "How skin with sun allergy looks varies widely depending on the color of your skin and what's causing the symptoms. • Signs and symptoms may include: Itchiness (pruritus) Stinging Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches A flushing of the exposed area Blisters or hives Symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun or other source of UV light. • Symptoms show up within minutes to hours after sun exposure. • See a health care provider if you have unusual, bothersome skin reactions after being in the sun. • For severe or persistent symptoms, you may need to see someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin disorders (dermatologist).",
      "Causes": "Causes of sun allergy include immune system reactions to sunlight, certain medications and chemicals that make the skin more sensitive to the sun. • It isn't clear why some people have a sun allergy and others don't. • Inherited traits may play a role.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for having an allergic reaction to sunlight include: Contact with certain substances. • Some sun allergy symptoms are triggered when your skin is exposed to a substance and then to sunlight. • Common substances responsible for this type of reaction include fragrances, disinfectants and chemicals used in some sunscreens. • Taking certain medications. • A number of medications can make the skin sunburn more quickly — including tetracycline antibiotics, sulfa-based drugs and pain relievers, such as ketoprofen. • Having another skin condition. • Having dermatitis increases your risk of having a sun allergy. • Having a blood relative with a sun allergy. • You're more likely to have a sun allergy if you have a sibling or parent with a sun allergy.",
      "Prevention": "If you have a sun allergy or an increased sensitivity to the sun, you can help prevent a reaction by taking these steps: Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. • The sun's rays are strongest during these hours. • Try to schedule outdoor activities for other times. • If you can't do that, limit the time you're in the sun. • Seek shade when possible. • Avoid sudden exposure to lots of sunlight. • Many people have sun allergy symptoms seasonally. • Symptoms occur when daylight hours get longer and people are exposed to more sunlight. • At these times, gradually increase the amount of time you spend outdoors so that your skin has time to adapt to increased sunlight. • Wear sunglasses and protective clothing. • Long-sleeved shirts and wide-brimmed hats can help protect your skin from sun exposure. • Avoid fabrics that are thin or have a loose weave — UV rays can pass through them. • Apply sunscreen. • Use a water-resistant, broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. • If you're using a product that contains physical blockers (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide), apply it over any other products you're wearing — except insect repellent. • Insect repellent goes on last. • Physical blockers provide the most effective protection for sensitive skin. • The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all sunscreen to retain its original strength for at least three years. • Check sunscreen labels for directions on storing and expiration dates. • Throw away sunscreen if it's expired or more than 3 years old. • Avoid known triggers. • If you know that a certain substance causes your skin reaction, such as a medication or contact with wild parsnip or limes, avoid that trigger. • Apply UV-blocking window film. • Put a UV-blocking film on the windows of your home and car."

      "Overview": "Sunburn is inflamed, painful skin that feels hot to the touch. • It often appears within a few hours of being in the sun too long. • You can get sunburn relief with simple self-care measures such as taking pain relievers and cooling the skin. • But it may take days for the sunburn to fade. • Preventing sunburn year-round by wearing sunscreen or using other skin-protection habits is important for everyone. • It is especially important when you're outdoors, even on cool or cloudy days.",
      "Symptoms": "Sunburn symptoms can include: Inflamed skin, which looks pink or red on white skin and may be harder to see on brown or Black skin. • Skin that feels warm or hot to the touch. • Pain, tenderness and itching. • Swelling. • Small, fluid-filled blisters, which may break. • Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue, if the sunburn is severe. • Eyes that feel painful or gritty. • Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. • Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. • The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. • Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure. • Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. • A bad sunburn may take several days to heal. • Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time. • See your health care provider if you: Develop large blisters. • Develop blisters on the face, hands or genitals. • Experience severe swelling of the affected area. • Show signs of infection, such as blisters with pus or streaks. • Experience worsening pain, headache, confusion, nausea, fever or chills. • Get worse despite at-home care. • Have eye pain or vision changes. • Seek immediate medical care if you are sunburned and experience: A fever over 103 F (39.4 C) with vomiting. • Confusion. • An infection. • Dehydration. • Cold skin, dizziness or faintness.",
      "Causes": "Sunburn is caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. • UV light may be from the sun or artificial sources, such as sunlamps and tanning beds. • UVA is the wavelength of light that can penetrate to the deep layers of skin and lead to skin damage over time. • UVB is the wavelength of light that penetrates the skin more superficially and causes sunburn. • The UV light damages skin cells. • The immune system reacts by increasing blood flow to the affected areas, which causes the inflamed skin (erythema) known as sunburn. • You can get sunburn on cool or cloudy days. • Surfaces such as snow, sand and water can reflect UV rays and burn skin too.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for sunburn include: Having white skin and red hair. • Having a history of sunburn. • Living or vacationing somewhere sunny, warm or at high altitude. • Working outdoors. • Swimming or spraying your skin with water or baby oil, as wet skin tends to burn more than does dry skin. • Mixing outdoor recreation and drinking alcohol. • Regularly exposing unprotected skin to UV light from sunlight or artificial sources, such as tanning beds. • Taking a drug that makes you more likely to burn (photosensitizing medication).",
      "Complications": "Intense, repeated sun exposure that results in sunburn increases your risk of other skin damage and certain diseases. • These include premature aging of skin (photoaging), precancerous skin lesions and skin cancer. • Sun exposure and repeated sunburns speed the skin's aging process. • Skin changes caused by UV light are called photoaging. • The results of photoaging include: Weakening of connective tissues, which reduces the skin's strength and elasticity. • Deep wrinkles. • Dry, rough skin. • Fine red veins on the cheeks, nose and ears. • Freckles, mostly on the face and shoulders. • Dark or discolored spots (macules) on the face, back of hands, arms, chest and upper back — also called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). • Precancerous skin lesions are rough, scaly patches in areas that have been damaged by the sun. • They're often found on the sun-exposed areas of the head, face, neck and hands of people whose skin burns easily in the sun. • These patches can evolve into skin cancer. • They're also called actinic keratoses (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-seez) and solar keratoses. • Excessive sun exposure, even without sunburn, increases your risk of skin cancer, such as melanoma. • It can damage the DNA of skin cells. • Sunburns in childhood and adolescence may increase the risk of melanoma later in life. • Skin cancer develops mainly on areas of the body most exposed to sunlight, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms, hands, legs and back. • Some types of skin cancer appear as a small growth or a sore that bleeds easily, crusts over, heals and then reopens. • With melanoma, an existing mole may change, or a new, suspicious-looking mole may grow. • See your health care provider if you notice: A new skin growth. • A bothersome change in your skin. • A change in the look or texture of a mole. • A sore that doesn't heal. • Too much UV light damages the cornea. • Sun damage to the lens can lead to clouding of the lens (cataracts). • Sunburned eyes may feel painful or gritty. • Sunburn of the cornea is also called snow blindness. • This type of damage might be caused by the sun, welding, tanning lamps and broken mercury vapor lamps.",
      "Prevention": "Use these methods to prevent sunburn, even on cool, cloudy or hazy days. • Sun exposure on cloudy days is decreased by about 20%. • Be extra careful around water, snow, concrete and sand because they reflect the sun's rays. • In addition, UV light is more intense at high altitudes. • Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. • The sun's rays are strongest during these hours, so try to schedule outdoor activities for other times. • If you can't do that, limit the time you're in the sun. • Seek shade when possible. • Avoid sun tanning and tanning beds. • Getting a base tan doesn't decrease your risk of sunburn. • If you use a self-tanning product to look tan, also apply a sunscreen before going outdoors. • Use sunscreen often and generously. • Use water-resistant, broad-spectrum lip balm and sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Broad-spectrum products offer protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. • SPF 30 blocks 97% of UVB rays. • No sunscreen can block 100% of the sun's UVB rays. • About 30 minutes before going outdoors, generously apply your sunscreen to clean, dry skin. • Use at least 2 tablespoons of sunscreen, or 1 ounce, to cover all surfaces of the exposed skin, except the eyelids. • If you're using spray sunscreen, spray it into your hands and then rub it into the skin. • This helps avoid inhaling the product. • Don't use a spray product while smoking or near an open flame. • If you're using a product that contains physical blockers (titanium oxide, zinc oxide), apply it over any other products you're wearing — except insect repellent. • Insect repellent goes on last. • Physical blockers provide the most effective protection for sensitive skin. • Reapply sunscreen every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. • If you're wearing makeup and want to reapply your sunscreen without redoing your whole face, one option is to use an SPF powder over makeup. • The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all sunscreen to retain its original strength for at least three years. • Check sunscreen labels for directions on storing and expiration dates. • Throw away sunscreen if it's expired or more than three years old. • Protect babies and toddlers. • Protect babies and toddlers from sunburn with brimmed hats and lightweight clothing that covers the arms and legs. • Keep them cool, hydrated and out of direct sunlight. • When that's not possible, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests applying sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 to the face and back of the hands. • The American Academy of Dermatology and the FDA don't suggest sunscreen for children under 6 months. • If sun-protective clothing and shade aren't available, sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are the next best choice. • Cover up. • When outside, other items such as umbrellas or wide-brimmed hats can offer protection in addition to sunscreen. • Dark clothing with a tight weave offers more protection. • Consider using outdoor gear specially designed to provide sun protection. • Check the label for its ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), which tells how well a fabric blocks sunlight. • The higher the UPF number, the better. • Wear sunglasses when outdoors. • Choose sunglasses with UVA and UVB protection. • Check the UV rating on the label when buying new glasses. • Darker lenses don't always mean better UV protection. • It also helps to wear sunglasses that fit close to your face or have wraparound frames. • Be aware of sun-sensitizing medications and cosmetics. • Some common prescription and nonprescription drugs can make skin more sensitive to sunlight. • Examples include antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and cholesterol-lowering drugs. • Talk with your pharmacist or health care provider about the side effects of drugs you take. • Cosmetics that contain alpha-hydroxy acids also increase sun sensitivity."

      "Overview": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a type of irregular heartbeat, also called an arrhythmia. • It's a very fast or erratic heartbeat that affects the heart's upper chambers. • SVT also is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. • The typical heart beats about 60 to 100 times a minute. • During SVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute. • Occasionally it beats faster or slower. • Most people with supraventricular tachycardia don't need treatment. • When recommended, treatment may include specific actions or movements, medicines, a heart procedure, or a device to control the heartbeat. • Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) falls into three main groups: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). • This is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia. • Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). • This is the second most common type of supraventricular tachycardia. • It's most commonly seen in younger people. • Atrial tachycardia. • This type of SVT is more commonly seen in people who have heart disease. • Atrial tachycardia doesn't involve the AV node. • Other types of supraventricular tachycardia include: Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia (SNRT). • Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). • Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). • Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET). • Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (NPJT).",
      "Symptoms": "The main symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a very fast heartbeat that may last for a few minutes to a few days. • The heart beats 100 or more times a minute. • Usually during SVT, the heart beats 150 to 220 times a minute. • The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly. • Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia may include: Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest, called palpitations. • A pounding sensation in the neck. • Chest pain. • Fainting or almost fainting. • Lightheadedness or dizziness. • Shortness of breath. • Sweating. • Weakness or extreme tiredness. • Some people with SVT do not notice symptoms. • In infants and very young children, symptoms of SVT may be vague. • The symptoms can include sweating, poor feeding, a change in skin color and a rapid pulse. • If your infant or young child has any of these symptoms, talk with a healthcare professional. • Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is usually not life-threatening unless you have heart damage or another heart condition. • But if SVT is severe, the irregular heartbeat may cause all heart activity to suddenly stop. • This is called sudden cardiac arrest. • Call a healthcare professional if you have a very fast heartbeat for the first time or if an irregular heartbeat lasts longer than a few seconds. • Symptoms of SVT may be related to a serious health condition. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have a very fast heartbeat that lasts for more than a few minutes or if a fast heartbeat occurs with these symptoms: Chest pain. • Dizziness. • Shortness of breath. • Weakness. • Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is caused by faulty signaling in the heart. • Electrical signals in the heart control the heartbeat. • In SVT, a change in heart signaling causes the heartbeat to start too early in the heart's upper chambers. • When this happens, the heartbeat speeds up. • The heart can't fill with blood properly. • Symptoms such as lightheadedness or dizziness can occur. • To understand the cause of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), it might help to know how the heart usually works. • The heart has four chambers: The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. • The sinus node makes the signals that start each heartbeat. • The signals move across the upper heart chambers. • Then the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. • The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. • In a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly. • The heart usually beats about 60 to 100 times a minute at rest. • But in SVT, the heart beats faster than 100 beats a minute. • The heart may beat 150 to 220 times a minute. • Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common type of arrhythmia in infants and children. • It also tends to occur more often in women, particularly during pregnancy. • Health conditions or treatments that may increase the risk of supraventricular tachycardia include: Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases. • Heart failure. • A heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect. • Previous heart surgery. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Thyroid disease. • Uncontrolled diabetes. • Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds. • Other things that may increase the risk of SVT include: Emotional stress. • Too much caffeine. • Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 14 or more drinks a week for men and seven or more drinks a week for women. • Smoking and nicotine use. • Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine. • When the heart beats too fast, it may not send enough blood to the body. • As a result, the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. • Over time, untreated and frequent attacks of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) may weaken the heart and lead to heart failure. • This is especially true in people who also have other medical conditions. • A severe attack of SVT may cause fainting or a sudden loss of all heart activity, called sudden cardiac arrest. • The same lifestyle changes used to manage supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) also may help prevent it. • Try these tips. • Follow a heart-healthy lifestyle. • Eat a nutritious diet, don't smoke, get regular exercise and manage stress. • Don't use a lot of caffeine. • Avoid large amounts of caffeine. • For most people with supraventricular tachycardia, moderate amounts of caffeine do not trigger episodes of SVT. • Keep a notebook or diary of when symptoms happen. • Include the symptoms, your heart rate and what you were doing at the time of the fast heartbeat. • This information can help you learn the things that trigger the very fast heartbeat. • Use medicines carefully. • Some medicines, including those bought without a prescription, may contain stimulants that can trigger SVT.",

      "Risk factors": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common type of arrhythmia in infants and children. • It also tends to occur more often in women, particularly during pregnancy. • Health conditions or treatments that may increase the risk of supraventricular tachycardia include: Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases. • Heart failure. • A heart problem present at birth, also called a congenital heart defect. • Previous heart surgery. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Thyroid disease. • Uncontrolled diabetes. • Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds. • Other things that may increase the risk of SVT include: Emotional stress. • Too much caffeine. • Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 14 or more drinks a week for men and seven or more drinks a week for women. • Smoking and nicotine use. • Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine.",
      "Complications": "When the heart beats too fast, it may not send enough blood to the body. • As a result, the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. • Over time, untreated and frequent attacks of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) may weaken the heart and lead to heart failure. • This is especially true in people who also have other medical conditions. • A severe attack of SVT may cause fainting or a sudden loss of all heart activity, called sudden cardiac arrest.",
      "Prevention": "The same lifestyle changes used to manage supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) also may help prevent it. • Try these tips. • Follow a heart-healthy lifestyle. • Eat a nutritious diet, don't smoke, get regular exercise and manage stress. • Don't use a lot of caffeine. • Avoid large amounts of caffeine. • For most people with supraventricular tachycardia, moderate amounts of caffeine do not trigger episodes of SVT. • Keep a notebook or diary of when symptoms happen. • Include the symptoms, your heart rate and what you were doing at the time of the fast heartbeat. • This information can help you learn the things that trigger the very fast heartbeat. • Use medicines carefully. • Some medicines, including those bought without a prescription, may contain stimulants that can trigger SVT."

      "Overview": "A breast lump is a growth of tissue that forms in the breast. • Most breast lumps are not irregular or cancerous. • But it's key to have your healthcare professional check them promptly.",
      "Symptoms": "Breast tissue typically might feel lumpy or ropy. • You also may have breast tenderness that comes and goes with your menstrual period. • If you have a health problem that affects your breasts, you might notice changes in how your breasts usually feel. • These changes can include: A round, smooth and firm breast lump. • A lump that feels firm and moves easily under the skin. • A hard breast lump with irregular edges. • An area of skin that has changed color. • Skin dimpling like an orange. • New changes in breast size or shape. • Fluid leaking from the nipple. • Make an appointment to have a breast lump checked, especially if: The lump is new and feels firm or fixed. • The lump doesn't go away after 4 to 6 weeks. • Or it has changed in size or in how it feels. • You notice skin changes on your breast such as a change in skin color, crusting, dimpling or puckering. • Fluid comes out of the nipple suddenly on more than one occasion. • The fluid might be bloody. • The nipple recently turned inward. • There is a new lump in your armpit, or a lump in your armpit seems to be getting bigger. • Breast lumps can be caused by: Breast cysts. • These fluid-filled sacs inside the breast are round, smooth and firm. • A breast cyst can range in size from a few millimeters to as large as an orange. • The tissue around it may be tender. • A breast cyst may appear before your period and get smaller, larger or go away afterward. • Breast cysts tend to come on quickly around the time of the menstrual cycle. • Fibrocystic breast changes. • With these changes, you may feel general fullness in your breasts. • Some areas may be lumpy or ropelike. • Your breasts may feel tender. • It's common to have fibrocystic breast changes related to the menstrual cycle. • The symptoms tend to get better after you have your period. • Fibroadenomas. • These solid breast tumors aren't cancer. • They're smooth, and they move easily under the skin when touched. • A fibroadenoma may get smaller over time or it may grow larger. • Factors that may be linked with fibroadenoma growth include being pregnant, using hormone therapy such as birth control pills or having a period. • Injury or post-surgery. • A serious injury to breast tissue or a complication after breast surgery can create a breast lump. • This is called fat necrosis. • Infections. • A collection of infected fluid called an abscess in breast tissue also can cause a breast lump. • The lump often is linked with breast pain, redness in that area and swelling of the skin. • Intraductal papilloma. • This is a skin tag-like growth in a milk duct. • It can cause the nipple to leak clear or bloody fluid. • It's usually not painful. • This growth can be seen on a breast ultrasound of the area under the nipple. • Lipoma. • This type of lump can feel soft. • It involves fatty breast tissue. • It's often harmless. • Breast cancer. • A breast lump that's painless, hard, has irregular edges and is different from the breast tissue around it might be breast cancer. • The skin covering the lump may thicken, change color or look red. • There also may be skin changes such as dimpled or pitted areas that look like the skin of an orange. • Your breast size and shape may change. • You may notice fluid leaking from the nipple, or the nipple may turn inward. • The lymph nodes under the arm or near the collarbone might be swollen. • See your healthcare professional to learn what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have. • Risk factors for breast lumps caused by conditions that are not cancer include the following: Age. • Some conditions that cause breast lumps are more common in the 30s and 40s. • These include fibrocystic changes and fibroadenomas. • Menstrual periods. • Before or during your period, you may feel a breast lump due to extra fluid in the breasts. • Pregnancy. • Your breasts may feel lumpy during pregnancy. • That's because the glands that make milk grow in number and get larger. • Premenopause. • As you get closer to menopause, hormone changes might make your breasts feel lumpier and tender. • Some risk factors for breast cancer are within your control to change. • These include: Alcohol. • The more alcohol you drink, the higher the risk of breast cancer. • Overweight or obesity. • The risk of breast cancer rises if you're overweight or obese after menopause. • A lack of exercise. • If you don't get physical activity, it may make you more likely to get breast cancer. • Not giving birth. • The risk of breast cancer is slightly higher in people who haven't had children or who didn't have children until after age 30. • Not breastfeeding. • The risk of breast cancer may be slightly higher in people who don't breastfeed their babies. • Hormonal birth control. • Birth control methods that use hormones to prevent pregnancy may slightly raise breast cancer risk. • These include birth control pills, shots and intrauterine devices. • Hormone therapy. • Long-term use of estrogen combined with progesterone can raise the risk of breast cancer. • Other risk factors for cancerous breast lumps can't be controlled. • These include: Being born female. • Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer. • Aging. • The risk of breast cancer rises with age. • Most often, tests find breast cancer in people 55 and older. • Gene changes. • Some types of breast cancer are caused by genes changes passed from parents to children, also called inherited gene changes. • A change in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is the most common cause of inherited breast cancer. • Family history of breast cancer. • You're more likely to get breast cancer if a close relative such as a parent or sibling also had the disease. • Dense breasts. • This means your breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, and less fatty tissue. • People with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer than those whose breast density is average. • Early menstrual periods or later menopause. • Starting your period at an early age, especially before 12, is linked with a slightly higher breast cancer risk. • Going through menopause after 55 also is tied to a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. • Certain breast conditions that aren't cancer. • Some benign breast conditions that cause lumps can make breast cancer more likely later on. • These conditions include atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, which involve too much cell growth in certain breast cells. • Another condition called lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) happens when cells grow in glands that make breast milk. • LCIS also can raise the risk for breast cancer. • Some conditions that cause breast lumps may lead to other health concerns, also called complications. • The complications depend on the type of breast lump that you have. • For example, without treatment, some breast infections can cause pockets of pus to form in the breast. • Other breast conditions that are not cancer still can raise the risk of breast cancer later on. • These include conditions that can cause lumps, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. • If you have a breast condition that raises the risk of cancer, it doesn't mean that you'll definitely get breast cancer. • Ask your healthcare professional what the risk means for you and whether you can make lifestyle changes to lower it. • Some breast lumps don't cause complications. • For example, small cysts and simple fibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own over time. • There's no clear way to prevent many breast lumps. • Breast lumps that are not cancer often are linked with natural changes in the body, such as hormonal changes over time. • But some risk factors for cancerous breast lumps are within your power to change. • Take the following steps to lower your chances of breast cancer: Drink less alcohol. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Eat a balanced diet. • Fill your plate with lean proteins, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables. • Eat less sugary, salty and processed foods. • Exercise. • The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aim to get 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week. • Or you can try to do 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity a week. • If you're not active now, ask your healthcare professional to help you get started.",

      "Overview": "Swimmer's itch is a rash that can occur after you go swimming or wading outdoors. • It's most common after being in freshwater lakes and ponds, but you can get it in saltwater too. • Swimmer's itch is usually caused by a reaction to tiny parasites in the water that burrow into your skin while you're swimming or wading in warm, calm water. • These parasites can't survive in people, so they soon die. • Swimmer's itch usually clears on its own within a few days. • In the meantime, you can control itching with medicine.",
      "Symptoms": "Swimmer's itch symptoms include an itchy rash that looks like pimples or blisters. • Symptoms may begin within minutes or as long as two days after swimming or wading in contaminated water. • Usually the rash affects skin that's not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders. • Your sensitivity to swimmer's itch can increase each time you're exposed to the parasites that cause it. • Talk to your health care provider if you have a rash after swimming that lasts more than a week. • If you notice pus at the rash site, check with your health care provider. • You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist).",
      "Causes": "Swimmer's itch is caused by an allergic reaction to parasites that burrow into your skin from warm water. • These parasites are found in some animals that live near ponds and lakes, including geese, ducks and muskrats. • The parasites' eggs get into the water through the animals' waste. • When the young parasites hatch, they live and grow in a type of snail that lives in shallow water. • The snails then release the parasites into the water, where they can infect humans. • Swimmer's itch isn't contagious from person to person.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase the risk of swimmer's itch include: Spending time in water that's infested with certain parasites. • Forgetting to dry off with a towel after getting out of the water. • Being sensitive to the parasites that cause swimmer's itch.",
      "Complications": "Swimmer's itch usually isn't serious, but your skin can become infected if you scratch the rash.",
      "Prevention": "Follow these tips to avoid swimmer's itch: Choose swimming spots carefully. • Avoid being in water near the shore where swimmer's itch is a known problem or where signs have been posted warning of the risk. • Also avoid being in marshy areas where snails are often found. • Rinse after swimming. • Rinse exposed skin with clean water right after leaving the water. • Then dry the skin with a towel. • Skip the bread crumbs. • Don't feed birds on piers or near swimming areas."

      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of synovial sarcoma depend on where the cancer starts. • Most people notice a painless lump or bump that slowly gets bigger. • The lump usually starts near the knee or ankle, but it can appear on any part of the body. • Synovial sarcoma symptoms may include: A lump or bump under the skin that slowly gets bigger. • Joint stiffness. • Pain. • Swelling. • Synovial sarcoma that happens in the head or neck can cause other symptoms. • These may include: Problems breathing. • Difficulty swallowing. • Changes in the way the voice sounds. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that don't go away and that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes synovial sarcoma. • This kind of cancer forms when cells develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.",
      "Risk factors": "Younger age is a risk factor for synovial sarcoma. • This cancer happens most often in older children and young adults. • There is no way to prevent synovial sarcoma."

      "Overview": "Syphilis is an infection caused by bacteria. • Most often, it spreads through sexual contact. • The disease starts as a sore that's often painless and typically appears on the genitals, rectum or mouth. • Syphilis spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores. • It also can be passed to a baby during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. • After the infection happens, syphilis bacteria can stay in the body for many years without causing symptoms. • But the infection can become active again. • Without treatment, syphilis can damage the heart, brain or other organs. • It can become life-threatening. • Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot of medicine called penicillin. • That's why it's key to get a health care checkup as soon as you notice any symptoms of syphilis. • All pregnant people should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal checkup too.",
      "Symptoms": "Syphilis develops in stages. • The symptoms vary with each stage. • But the stages may overlap. • And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. • You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years. • The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). • The sore is often painless. • It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. • Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. • Some people get more than one. • The chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria. • Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre. • That's because it's usually painless. • It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. • The chancre heals on its own within 3 to 6 weeks. • You may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals. • A rash caused by syphilis: Often is not itchy. • May look rough, red or reddish-brown. • Might be so faint that it's hard to see. • The rash often starts on the trunk of the body. • That includes the chest, stomach area, pelvis and back. • In time, it also could appear on the limbs, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. • Along with the rash, you may have symptoms such as: Wartlike sores in the mouth or genital area. • Hair loss. • Muscle aches. • Fever. • Sore throat. • Tiredness, also called fatigue. • Weight loss. • Swollen lymph nodes. • Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own. • But without treatment, they could come and go for months or years. • If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the latent stage. • This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms. • The latent stage can last for years. • Your symptoms may never come back. • But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications. • After the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications known as tertiary syphilis. • Another name for it is late syphilis. • The disease may damage the: Brain. • Nerves. • Eyes. • Heart. • Blood vessels. • Liver. • Bones and joints. • These problems may happen many years after the original, untreated infection. • At any stage, untreated syphilis can affect the brain, spinal cord, eyes and other body parts. • This can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. • Pregnant people who have syphilis can pass the disease to their babies. • Unborn babies can become infected through the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen in the womb, called the placenta. • Infection also can happen during birth. • Newborns with congenital syphilis might have no symptoms. • But without fast treatment, some babies might get: Sores and rashes on the skin. • Fever. • A type of discolored skin and eyes, called jaundice. • Not enough red blood cells, called anemia. • Swollen spleen and liver. • Sneezing or stuffed, drippy nose, called rhinitis. • Bone changes. • Later symptoms may include deafness, teeth problems and saddle nose, a condition in which the bridge of the nose collapses. • Babies with syphilis also can be born too early. • They may die in the womb before birth. • Or they could die after birth. • Call a member of your health care team if you or your child has any symptoms of syphilis. • These could include any unusual discharge, a sore or a rash, especially in the groin area. • Also get tested for syphilis if you: Have had sexual contact with someone who might have the disease. • Have another sexually transmitted disease such as HIV. • Are pregnant. • Regularly have sex with more than one partner. • Have unprotected sex, meaning sex without a condom. • The cause of syphilis is a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. • The most common way syphilis spreads is through contact with an infected person's sore during vaginal, oral or anal sex. • The bacteria enter the body through minor cuts or scrapes in the skin or in the moist inner lining of some body parts. • Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages. • Sometimes it's also contagious in the early latent period, which happens within a year of getting infected. • Less often, syphilis can spread by kissing or touching an active sore on the lips, tongue, mouth, breasts or genitals. • It also can be passed to babies during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. • Syphilis can't be spread through casual contact with objects that an infected person has touched. • So you can't catch it by using the same toilet, bathtub, clothing, eating utensils, doorknobs, swimming pools or hot tubs. • Once cured, syphilis doesn't come back on its own. • But you can become infected again if you have contact with someone's syphilis sore. • The risk of catching syphilis is higher if you: Have unprotected sex. • Have sex with more than one partner. • Live with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS if untreated. • The chances of getting syphilis also are higher for men who have sex with men. • The higher risk may be linked, in part, with less access to health care and less use of condoms among this group. • Another risk factor for some people in this group includes recent sex with partners found through social media apps. • Without treatment, syphilis can lead to damage throughout the body. • Syphilis also raises the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy. • Treatment can help prevent damage. • But it can't repair or reverse damage that's already happened. • Rarely in the late stage of syphilis, bumps called gummas can form on the skin, bones, liver or any other organ. • Most often, gummas go away after treatment with medicine called antibiotics. • Syphilis can cause many problems with the brain, its covering or the spinal cord. • These issues include: Headache. • Stroke. • Meningitis, a disease that inflames the protective layers of tissue around the brain and spinal cord. • Confusion, personality changes or trouble focusing. • Symptoms that mimic dementia, such as loss of memory, judgment and decision-making skills. • Not being able to move certain body parts, called paralysis. • Trouble getting or keeping an erection, called erectile dysfunction. • Bladder problems. • Disease that spreads to the eye is called ocular syphilis. • It can cause: Eye pain or redness. • Vision changes. • Blindness. • Disease that spreads to the ear is called otosyphilis. • Symptoms can include: Hearing loss. • Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus. • Feeling like you or the world around you is spinning, called vertigo. • These may include bulging and swelling of the aorta — the body's major artery — and other blood vessels. • Syphilis also may damage heart valves. • Syphilis sores on the genitals raise the risk of catching or spreading HIV through sex. • A syphilis sore can bleed easily. • This provides an easy way for HIV to enter the bloodstream during sex. • If you're pregnant, you could pass syphilis to your unborn baby. • Congenital syphilis greatly raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or your newborn's death within a few days after birth. • There is no vaccine for syphilis. • To help prevent the spread of syphilis, follow these tips: Have safe sex or no sex. • The only certain way to avoid contact with syphilis bacteria is not to have sex. • This is called abstinence. • If a person is sexually active, safer sex means a long-term relationship in which you and your partner have sex only with each other, and neither of you is infected. • Before you have sex with someone new, you should both get tested for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). • Use a latex condom. • Condoms can lower your risk of getting or spreading syphilis. • But condoms work only if they cover an infected person's syphilis sores. • Other types of birth control do not lower your risk of syphilis. • Be careful with alcohol and stay away from street drugs. • Drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs can get in the way of your judgment. • Either can lead to unsafe sex. • Do not douche. • It can remove some of the healthy bacteria that's usually in the vagina. • And that might raise your risk of getting STIs. • Breastfeed with caution. • Syphilis can pass from a parent to a baby during breastfeeding if sores are on one or both breasts. • This can happen when the baby or pumping equipment touches a sore. • To keep that from happening, pump or hand-express breastmilk from the breast with sores. • Do so until the sores heal. • If your pump touches a sore, get rid of the milk you just pumped. • A medicine called doxycycline may be an option to prevent infection among people who have a higher risk than average of getting syphilis. • Higher risk groups include men who have sex with men and transgender women. • Taking doxycycline within 3 days of sexual activity lowers the risk of an infection with the bacteria that cause syphilis. • Your healthcare professional can prescribe doxycycline and any testing you need while taking the medicine. • If tests show that you have syphilis, your sex partners need to know so that they can get tested. • This includes your current partners and any others you've had over the last three months to 1 year. • If they're infected, they can then get treatment. • After you learn you have syphilis, your local health department may contact you. • A department employee talks with you about private ways to let your partners know that they've been exposed to syphilis. • You can ask the department to do this for you without revealing your identity to your partners. • Or you can contact your partners along with a department employee or simply tell your partners yourself. • This free service is called partner notification. • It can help limit the spread of syphilis. • The practice also steers those at risk toward counseling and the right treatment. • And since you can get syphilis more than once, partner notification lowers your risk of getting infected again. • You can be infected with syphilis and not know it. • And the disease can have deadly effects on unborn babies. • For this reason, health officials recommend that all pregnant people be tested for the disease.",
      "Causes": "The cause of syphilis is a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. • The most common way syphilis spreads is through contact with an infected person's sore during vaginal, oral or anal sex. • The bacteria enter the body through minor cuts or scrapes in the skin or in the moist inner lining of some body parts. • Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages. • Sometimes it's also contagious in the early latent period, which happens within a year of getting infected. • Less often, syphilis can spread by kissing or touching an active sore on the lips, tongue, mouth, breasts or genitals. • It also can be passed to babies during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. • Syphilis can't be spread through casual contact with objects that an infected person has touched. • So you can't catch it by using the same toilet, bathtub, clothing, eating utensils, doorknobs, swimming pools or hot tubs. • Once cured, syphilis doesn't come back on its own. • But you can become infected again if you have contact with someone's syphilis sore.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of catching syphilis is higher if you: Have unprotected sex. • Have sex with more than one partner. • Live with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS if untreated. • The chances of getting syphilis also are higher for men who have sex with men. • The higher risk may be linked, in part, with less access to health care and less use of condoms among this group. • Another risk factor for some people in this group includes recent sex with partners found through social media apps.",
      "Complications": "Without treatment, syphilis can lead to damage throughout the body. • Syphilis also raises the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy. • Treatment can help prevent damage. • But it can't repair or reverse damage that's already happened. • Rarely in the late stage of syphilis, bumps called gummas can form on the skin, bones, liver or any other organ. • Most often, gummas go away after treatment with medicine called antibiotics. • Syphilis can cause many problems with the brain, its covering or the spinal cord. • These issues include: Headache. • Stroke. • Meningitis, a disease that inflames the protective layers of tissue around the brain and spinal cord. • Confusion, personality changes or trouble focusing. • Symptoms that mimic dementia, such as loss of memory, judgment and decision-making skills. • Not being able to move certain body parts, called paralysis. • Trouble getting or keeping an erection, called erectile dysfunction. • Bladder problems. • Disease that spreads to the eye is called ocular syphilis. • It can cause: Eye pain or redness. • Vision changes. • Blindness. • Disease that spreads to the ear is called otosyphilis. • Symptoms can include: Hearing loss. • Ringing in the ears, called tinnitus. • Feeling like you or the world around you is spinning, called vertigo. • These may include bulging and swelling of the aorta — the body's major artery — and other blood vessels. • Syphilis also may damage heart valves. • Syphilis sores on the genitals raise the risk of catching or spreading HIV through sex. • A syphilis sore can bleed easily. • This provides an easy way for HIV to enter the bloodstream during sex. • If you're pregnant, you could pass syphilis to your unborn baby. • Congenital syphilis greatly raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or your newborn's death within a few days after birth.",
      "Prevention": "There is no vaccine for syphilis. • To help prevent the spread of syphilis, follow these tips: Have safe sex or no sex. • The only certain way to avoid contact with syphilis bacteria is not to have sex. • This is called abstinence. • If a person is sexually active, safer sex means a long-term relationship in which you and your partner have sex only with each other, and neither of you is infected. • Before you have sex with someone new, you should both get tested for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). • Use a latex condom. • Condoms can lower your risk of getting or spreading syphilis. • But condoms work only if they cover an infected person's syphilis sores. • Other types of birth control do not lower your risk of syphilis. • Be careful with alcohol and stay away from street drugs. • Drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs can get in the way of your judgment. • Either can lead to unsafe sex. • Do not douche. • It can remove some of the healthy bacteria that's usually in the vagina. • And that might raise your risk of getting STIs. • Breastfeed with caution. • Syphilis can pass from a parent to a baby during breastfeeding if sores are on one or both breasts. • This can happen when the baby or pumping equipment touches a sore. • To keep that from happening, pump or hand-express breastmilk from the breast with sores. • Do so until the sores heal. • If your pump touches a sore, get rid of the milk you just pumped. • A medicine called doxycycline may be an option to prevent infection among people who have a higher risk than average of getting syphilis. • Higher risk groups include men who have sex with men and transgender women. • Taking doxycycline within 3 days of sexual activity lowers the risk of an infection with the bacteria that cause syphilis. • Your healthcare professional can prescribe doxycycline and any testing you need while taking the medicine. • If tests show that you have syphilis, your sex partners need to know so that they can get tested. • This includes your current partners and any others you've had over the last three months to 1 year. • If they're infected, they can then get treatment. • After you learn you have syphilis, your local health department may contact you. • A department employee talks with you about private ways to let your partners know that they've been exposed to syphilis. • You can ask the department to do this for you without revealing your identity to your partners. • Or you can contact your partners along with a department employee or simply tell your partners yourself. • This free service is called partner notification. • It can help limit the spread of syphilis. • The practice also steers those at risk toward counseling and the right treatment. • And since you can get syphilis more than once, partner notification lowers your risk of getting infected again. • You can be infected with syphilis and not know it. • And the disease can have deadly effects on unborn babies. • For this reason, health officials recommend that all pregnant people be tested for the disease."

      "Overview": "Syringomyelia (sih-ring-go-my-E-lee-uh) is the development of a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord. • The cyst, which is sometimes called a syrinx, can grow larger over time. • When it does, it can damage the spinal cord and cause pain, weakness and stiffness. • Syringomyelia has several possible causes. • Many cases are associated with a Chiari malformation. • This is a condition in which brain tissue pushes into the spinal canal. • Other causes of syringomyelia include spinal cord tumors, spinal cord injuries and damage caused by swelling around the spinal cord. • If syringomyelia doesn't cause problems, monitoring the condition might be all that's necessary. • But if the symptoms are bothersome, surgery might be needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Syringomyelia symptoms usually develop slowly over time. • If syringomyelia is caused by brain tissue pushing into the spinal canal, it is called a Chiari malformation. • Symptoms generally begin between ages 25 and 40. • In some cases, coughing or straining can trigger symptoms of syringomyelia, although neither causes syringomyelia. • Syringomyelia might affect the back, shoulders, arms or legs. • Symptoms can include: Muscle weakness and muscle wasting. • Loss of reflexes. • Loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature. • Headaches. • Stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms and legs. • Pain in the neck, arms and back. • Scoliosis. • This is when the spine curves sideways. • If you have any of the symptoms associated with syringomyelia, see your healthcare professional. • If you've had a spinal cord injury, watch for symptoms of syringomyelia. • It may take months to years after an injury before syringomyelia develops. • Make sure your healthcare professional knows you had a spinal cord injury.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear how and why syringomyelia happens. • When it develops, the fluid that surrounds, cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord collects within the spinal cord itself. • This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. • If it collects and forms a fluid-filled cyst, it is called a syrinx. • Several conditions and diseases can lead to syringomyelia, including: Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue pushes into the spinal canal and blocks the regular flow of cerebrospinal fluid. • Meningitis, which is swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. • Spinal cord tumor, which can interfere with the regular flow of cerebrospinal fluid. • Conditions present at birth, such as a tethered spinal cord. • A tethered spinal cord is a condition caused when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movement. • Spinal cord injury, which can cause symptoms months or years later.",
      "Complications": "In some people, syringomyelia can progress and lead to serious complications. • Other people have no symptoms. • A syrinx can cause complications if it grows or damages nerves within the spinal cord. • Complications include: Scoliosis. • This is when the spine curves sideways. • Chronic pain resulting from damage to the spinal cord. • Motor difficulties that can affect walking. • Examples include weakness and stiffness in the leg muscles. • Paralysis."

      "Overview": "Systemic mastocytosis (mas-to-sy-TOE-sis) is a rare disorder that results in too many mast cells building up in your body. • A mast cell is a type of white blood cell. • Mast cells are found in connective tissues throughout your body. • Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect you from disease. • When you have systemic mastocytosis, excess mast cells build up in your skin, bone marrow, digestive tract or other body organs. • When triggered, these mast cells release substances that can cause signs and symptoms similar to those of an allergic reaction and, sometimes, severe inflammation that may result in organ damage. • Common triggers include alcohol, spicy foods, insect stings and certain medications.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis depend on the part of the body affected by excessive mast cells. • Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. • Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected. • Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include: Flushing, itching or hives Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Anemia or bleeding disorders Bone and muscle pain Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. • People have different triggers, but the most common ones include: Alcohol Skin irritation Spicy foods Exercise Insect stings Certain medications When to see a doctor Talk to your doctor if you have problems with flushing or hives, or if you have concerns about the signs or symptoms listed above.",
      "Causes": "Most cases of systemic mastocytosis are caused by a random change (mutation) in the KIT gene. • Typically this flaw in the KIT gene is not inherited. • Too many mast cells are produced and build up in tissues and body organs, releasing substances such as histamine, leukotrienes and cytokines that cause inflammation and symptoms.",
      "Complications": "Complications of systemic mastocytosis can include: Anaphylactic reaction. • This severe allergic reaction includes signs and symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, fainting, loss of consciousness and shock. • If you have a severe allergic reaction, you may need an injection of epinephrine. • Blood disorders. • These can include anemia and poor blood clotting. • Peptic ulcer disease. • Chronic stomach irritation can lead to ulcers and bleeding in your digestive tract. • Reduced bone density. • Because systemic mastocytosis can affect your bones and bone marrow, you may be at risk of bone problems, such as osteoporosis. • Organ failure. • A buildup of mast cells in body organs can cause inflammation and damage to the organ."
