      "Overview": "Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh) is the medical term for a heart rate over 100 beats a minute. • Many types of irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, can cause tachycardia. • A fast heart rate isn't always a concern. • For instance, the heart rate usually rises during exercise or as a response to stress. • Tachycardia may not cause any symptoms or complications. • But sometimes it's a warning of a medical condition that needs attention. • Some forms of tachycardia can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. • Such problems may include heart failure, stroke or sudden cardiac death. • Treatment for tachycardia may include specific actions or movements, medicine, cardioversion, or surgery to control a rapid heartbeat. • There are many different types of tachycardia. • Sinus tachycardia refers to a usual increase in the heart rate often caused by exercise or stress. • Other types of tachycardia are grouped according to cause and the part of the heart causing the fast heart rate. • Common types of tachycardia caused by irregular heart rhythms include: Atrial fibrillation, also called AFib. • This is the most common type of tachycardia. • Chaotic, irregular electrical signals start in the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria. • These signals trigger a fast heartbeat. • A-fib may be temporary. • But some episodes won't end unless treated. • Atrial flutter. • Atrial flutter is similar to A-fib, but heartbeats are more organized. • Episodes of atrial flutter may go away by themselves or may need treatment. • People who have atrial flutter also often have A-fib at other times. • Ventricular tachycardia. • This irregular heart rhythm starts in the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • The fast heart rate doesn't let the ventricles fill and squeeze to pump enough blood to the body. • Episodes may be brief and last only a couple of seconds without causing harm. • But episodes lasting more than a few seconds can be life-threatening. • Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). • Supraventricular tachycardia is a broad term that includes irregular heart rhythms that start above the lower heart chambers. • Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a pounding heartbeat that begin and end abruptly. • Ventricular fibrillation. • This serious condition can be deadly if the heart rhythm isn't reset within minutes. • Rapid, chaotic electrical signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver instead of squeezing in a coordinated way. • Most people with this type of irregular heart rhythm have heart disease or have had a serious injury, such as being struck by lightning.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people with tachycardia have no symptoms. • The fast heartbeat may be discovered when a physical exam or heart tests are done for another reason. • In general, tachycardia may cause these symptoms: Racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest, called palpitations. • Chest pain. • Fainting. • Lightheadedness. • Rapid pulse. • Shortness of breath. • Many things can cause tachycardia. • If you feel like your heart is beating too fast, make an appointment for a health checkup. • Seek immediate medical help if you have: Chest pain or discomfort. • Shortness of breath. • Weakness. • Dizziness or lightheadedness. • Fainting or near fainting. • A type of tachycardia called ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. • During ventricular fibrillation, blood pressure drops dramatically. • The person's breathing and pulse stop because the heart is not pumping any blood to the body. • This also is called cardiac arrest. • The person usually falls down, also called collapses. • If this happens, do the following: Call 911 or the emergency number in your area. • Start CPR. • CPR helps keep blood flowing to the organs until other treatments can start. • If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. • Push hard and fast on the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute until paramedics arrive. • The American Heart Association suggests doing compressions to the beat of the song \"Stayin' Alive.\" You don't need to do rescue breathing. • Have someone get an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby. • An AED is a portable device that delivers a shock to reset the heart rhythm. • No training is needed to use the device. • The AED tells you what to do. • It's programmed to give a shock only when appropriate. • Tachycardia is an increased heart rate for any reason. • If a fast heart rate is caused by exercise or stress, it's called sinus tachycardia. • Sinus tachycardia is a symptom, not a condition. • Most heart conditions can lead to different forms of tachycardia. • Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, are one cause. • An example of an irregular heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Other things that may lead to tachycardia include: Fever. • Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 14 or more drinks a week for a man or seven or more drinks a week for a woman. • Alcohol withdrawal. • Too much caffeine. • High or low blood pressure. • Changes in the level of minerals in the body, called electrolytes. • Examples include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. • Certain medicines. • Overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism. • A low number of red blood cells, called anemia. • Smoking or nicotine use. • Use of illegal stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine. • Heart attack. • Sometimes the exact cause of tachycardia is not known. • To understand the cause of tachycardia, it may be helpful to know how the heart usually works. • The heart has four chambers: The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. • The sinus node makes the signals that start each heartbeat. • The signals move across the upper heart chambers. • Then the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. • The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. • In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. • The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute. • But in tachycardia, something causes the heart to beat faster than 100 beats a minute. • In general, things that may raise the risk of irregular heart rhythms that commonly cause tachycardia include: Getting older. • Having a family history of some heart rhythm disorders. • High blood pressure. • Lifestyle changes or treatment of heart conditions may lower the risk of tachycardia. • When the heart beats too fast, it may not pump enough blood to the body. • As a result, the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. • Complications of tachycardia depend on: The type of tachycardia. • How fast the heart is beating. • How long the rapid heart rate lasts. • Whether there are other heart conditions. • Potential complications of tachycardia may include: Blood clots that can cause a heart attack or stroke. • Blood-thinning medicine may be used to lower this risk. • Frequent fainting or unconsciousness. • Heart failure. • Sudden cardiac death. • This is usually only associated with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. • The best way to prevent tachycardia is to keep the heart healthy. • Have regular health checkups. • If you have heart disease, follow your treatment plan. • Take all medicines as directed. • Try these tips to prevent heart disease and keep the heart healthy: Don't smoke. • Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress. • Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Get good sleep. • Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily. • Talk to your healthcare team before using any medicines. • Some cold and cough medicines have stimulants that may start a rapid heartbeat. • Illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are other stimulants that can cause changes in the heart's rhythm.",

      "Overview": "A tapeworm is a parasite that can live and feed in human intestines. • This is called a tapeworm infection. • A young and inactive form of the tapeworm is called a larval cyst. • It can stay alive in other parts of the body. • This is called a larval cyst infection. • A tapeworm in the intestines often causes mild symptoms. • Moderate to severe symptoms may include stomach pain and diarrhea. • Larval cysts can cause serious disease if they are in a person's brain, liver, lungs, heart or eyes. • Tapeworm infections are treated with anti-parasitic drugs. • Treatments for larval cyst infections may include anti-parasitic drugs and surgery to remove the cyst. • Other drugs may be used to treat symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend mostly on where the infection happens in the body. • A tapeworm in the intestines may cause no symptoms. • The severity of symptoms depends in part on the number of tapeworms. • Symptoms vary. • And some symptoms are more likely with some species of tapeworm. • Symptoms may include: Upset stomach, or feeling like you could throw up. • Stomachache or stomach pain. • Not wanting to eat. • Loose stools. • Diarrhea. • Weight loss. • Gas. • Hunger pains. • Cravings for salty food. • Symptoms of larval cyst infection depend on where they are causing disease in the body. • Larval cysts in the brain or spine. • These may cause: Headache. • Seizures. • Dizziness. • Nerve pain in the spine or limbs. • Muscle weakness. • Poor coordination. • Changes in thinking or behaviors. • Larval cysts in other organs. • These can affect how well the organ works. • For example, larval cysts can cause severe disease in the liver, lungs or heart. • Symptoms vary widely. • In some cases, a lump can be felt. • There also may be pain and swelling at the site of the larval cyst infection. • If you experience any of the symptoms of tapeworm or larval cyst infection, get medical care. • Most tapeworms need two different hosts to complete a life cycle. • One host is the place where a parasite grows from egg to larva, called the intermediate host. • The other host is where the larva become adults, called the definitive host. • For example, beef tapeworms need cattle and humans to go through a complete life cycle. • The beef tapeworm eggs can survive in the environment for months or years. • If a cow, the intermediate host, eats grass with these eggs on it, the eggs hatch in its intestines. • The young parasite, called a larva, passes into the bloodstream and moves to muscles. • It forms a protective shell, called a cyst. • When people, the definitive host, eat undercooked meat from that cow, they can develop a tapeworm infection. • The larval cyst develops into an adult tapeworm. • The tapeworm attaches to the wall of the intestine where it feeds. • It produces eggs that pass in the person's stool. • In this case, the cow is called the intermediate host, and the person is the definitive host. • Humans are the definitive hosts for some species of tapeworms. • They may get a tapeworm infection after eating raw or undercooked: Beef. • Pork. • Fish. • Humans may be the intermediate hosts for other tapeworm species. • This usually happens when they drink water or eat food with tapeworm eggs. • Humans also can be exposed to eggs in dog feces. • An egg hatches in the person's intestines. • The larva travels through the bloodstream and forms a cyst somewhere in the body. • The larval cyst matures. • But it won't become a tapeworm. • Cysts vary by species. • Some cysts have a single larva. • Others have several larvae. • Or they can make more. • If a cyst bursts, it can lead to cysts forming in other parts of the body. • Symptoms usually show up years after the infection began. • They happen when the immune system responds to the cyst shedding debris, breaking down or hardening. • Symptoms also appear when one or more cysts keep an organ from working correctly. • There are two exceptions to the typical life cycle of tapeworms that can infect humans. • Pork tapeworms. • Humans can be a definitive host or an intermediate host for pork tapeworms. • For example, a person can have adult pork tapeworms from eating undercooked pork. • The eggs pass in the person's stool. • Poor handwashing may lead to the same person or another person being exposed to the eggs. • If this happens, a person can get a larval cyst infection. • Dwarf tapeworm. • The dwarf tapeworm enters humans as eggs from food or water. • Exposure also may happen because of poor handwashing. • The egg hatches in the intestines. • The larva burrows into the wall of the intestines and forms a larval cyst. • This becomes an adult dwarf tapeworm. • Some eggs from the tapeworm pass in stool. • Other eggs hatch in the intestine to make a repeating cycle. • Factors that may put you at greater risk of tapeworm or larval cyst infection include: Eating raw or undercooked meats. • The main risk factor for tapeworm infection is eating raw or undercooked meat and fish. • Dried and smoked fish also may have larval cysts in them. • Poor hygiene. • Poor handwashing increases the risk of getting and spreading infections. • Unwashed fruits and vegetables also can carry tapeworm eggs. • Lack of sanitation and sewage. • Lack of sanitation and sewage for human waste increases the risk of livestock getting tapeworm eggs from people. • This increases the risk of people eating infected meat. • Lack of clean water. • A lack of clean water for drinking, bathing and making food increases the risk of exposure to tapeworm eggs. • High-risk regions. • Living in or traveling to regions with high rates of infection is a risk factor. • Tapeworm infections usually don't cause complications. • Problems that may happen include: Anemia. • Long-term infection with a fish tapeworm may lead to the body not making enough healthy red blood cells, also called anemia. • This can happen because the tapeworm keeps the body from getting enough vitamin B-12. • Blockages. • In some cases, a part of a tapeworm can block a duct that connects another organ to the intestines. • Anxiety. • People may be anxious or stressed about having a tapeworm infection, seeing parts of tapeworms in stool or passing long tapeworms. • Severe allergic reaction. • Larval cysts may shed debris or break down. • When the immune system reacts, it may cause symptoms of severe allergy. • Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, fainting, fever and a drop in blood pressure. • Complications from larval cysts vary depending on what organ is affected. • Serious complications include the following. • Larval cysts in the brain or central nervous system. • These can cause: Inflammation, or swelling, of the fluids and membranes surrounding the brain and spinal column, also called meningitis. • Buildup of fluid in the brain, also called hydrocephalus. • Pressure on the spinal cord. • Damage to nerves, blood vessels or the brainstem. • Larval cysts in other organs. • These can lead to: Cyst growth that damages organ tissue. • Bacterial disease in cysts. • Bacterial disease related to blockages caused by cysts. • These steps can help prevent infections with tapeworms or tapeworm larval cysts. • Wash your hands. • Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. • This is very important after using the toilet, before eating, and before and after handling food. • Wash fruits and vegetables. • Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, peeling or preparing them. • Wash kitchen utensils well. • Wash cutting boards, knives and other utensils with soapy water after contact with raw meats or unwashed fruits and vegetables. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meat or fish. • Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough to kill larval cysts. • Cook whole meats and fish to at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) and let rest for at least three minutes. • Cook ground meat to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius). • Freeze meat. • Freezing meat and fish can kill larval cysts. • Freeze at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 20 degrees Celsius) or below for 7 days. • Treat infected dogs. • Treat dogs with tapeworms right away.",

      "Overview": "Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. • It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. • These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. • In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. • As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. • Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. • Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years. • Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. • Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood. • If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.",
      "Symptoms": "There are three forms of Tay-Sachs disease: infantile, juvenile and late onset/adult. • In the most common and severe form, called infantile form, an infant typically begins showing signs and symptoms by about 3 to 6 months of age. • Survival is usually only a few years. • Signs and symptoms can include: Exaggerated startle response when the baby hears loud noises \"Cherry-red\" spots in the eyes Loss of motor skills, including turning over, crawling and sitting up Muscle weakness, progressing to paralysis Movement problems Seizures Vision loss and blindness Hearing loss and deafness Problems swallowing Loss of mental functions and a lack of response to surroundings Growth in head size (progressive macrocephaly) The juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease is less common. • Signs and symptoms vary in severity and begin in childhood. • Survival is typically into the teen years. • Signs and symptoms can include: Behavior problems Gradual loss of skills and movement control Frequent respiratory infections Slow loss of vision and speech Decline in mental function and responsiveness Seizures This is a rare and less severe form with signs and symptoms beginning in late childhood to adulthood. • Severity of symptoms varies greatly, and this form does not always impact life expectancy. • Signs and symptoms progress slowly and can include: Muscle weakness Clumsiness and loss of coordination Tremors and muscle spasms Loss of the ability to walk Problems speaking and swallowing Psychiatric disorders Sometimes loss of mental function If you or your child has any of the signs or symptoms that may indicate Tay-Sachs disease, or if you have concerns about your child's development, schedule an appointment with your health care provider.",
      "Causes": "Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that is passed from parents to their children. • It occurs when a child inherits a flaw (mutation) in the HEXA gene from both parents. • The genetic change that causes Tay-Sachs disease results in a deficiency of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A. • This enzyme is required to break down the fatty substance GM2 ganglioside. • The buildup of fatty substances damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. • Severity and age of onset of the disease relates to how much enzyme is still produced.",
      "Risk factors": "Because the gene change that causes Tay-Sachs disease is found more often in certain populations, risk factors for Tay-Sachs disease include having ancestors from: Eastern and Central European Jewish communities (Ashkenazi Jews) Certain French Canadian communities in Quebec Cajun community of Louisiana Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania A blood test can be used to identify carriers of the HEXA gene change that causes Tay-Sachs disease. • Genetic counseling is recommended following testing."

      "Overview": "Teen depression is a serious mental health problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. • It affects how your teenager thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. • Although depression can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults. • Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. • But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings — they're a symptom of depression. • Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower — it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. • For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling.",
      "Symptoms": "Teen depression signs and symptoms include a change from the teenager's previous attitude and behavior that can cause significant distress and problems at school or home, in social activities, or in other areas of life. • Depression symptoms can vary in severity, but changes in your teen's emotions and behavior may include the examples below. • Be alert for emotional changes, such as: Feelings of sadness, which can include crying spells for no apparent reason Frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters Feeling hopeless or empty Irritable or annoyed mood Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends Low self-esteem Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Fixation on past failures or exaggerated self-blame or self-criticism Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and the need for excessive reassurance Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Ongoing sense that life and the future are grim and bleak Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide Watch for changes in behavior, such as: Tiredness and loss of energy Insomnia or sleeping too much Changes in appetite — decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain Use of alcohol or drugs Agitation or restlessness — for example, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Frequent complaints of unexplained body aches and headaches, which may include frequent visits to the school nurse Social isolation Poor school performance or frequent absences from school Less attention to personal hygiene or appearance Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting-out behaviors Self-harm — for example, cutting or burning Making a suicide plan or a suicide attempt It can be difficult to tell the difference between ups and downs that are just part of being a teenager and teen depression. • Talk with your teen. • Try to determine whether he or she seems capable of managing challenging feelings, or if life seems overwhelming. • If depression signs and symptoms continue, begin to interfere in your teen's life, or cause you to have concerns about suicide or your teen's safety, talk to a doctor or a mental health professional trained to work with adolescents. • Your teen's family doctor or pediatrician is a good place to start. • Or your teen's school may recommend someone. • Depression symptoms likely won't get better on their own — and they may get worse or lead to other problems if untreated. • Depressed teenagers may be at risk of suicide, even if signs and symptoms don't appear to be severe. • If you're a teen and you think you may be depressed — or you have a friend who may be depressed — don't wait to get help. • Talk to a health care provider such as your doctor or school nurse. • Share your concerns with a parent, a close friend, a spiritual leader, a teacher or someone else you trust. • Suicide is often associated with depression. • If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your mental health professional. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • The Spanish language phone line is 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • Services are free and confidential. • Or contact a crisis service for teenagers in the U.S. called TXT 4 HELP: Text the word \"safe\" and your current location to 4HELP (44357) for immediate help, with the option for interactive texting. • Seek help from your primary care doctor or other health care provider. • Reach out to a close friend or loved one. • Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. • If a loved one or friend is in danger of attempting suicide or has made an attempt: Make sure someone stays with that person. • Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. • Never ignore comments or concerns about suicide. • Always take action to get help. • It's not known exactly what causes depression, but a variety of issues may be involved. • These include: Brain chemistry. • Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. • When these chemicals are abnormal or impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems changes, leading to depression. • Hormones. • Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. • Inherited traits. • Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives — such as a parent or grandparent — also have the condition. • Early childhood trauma. • Traumatic events during childhood, such as physical or emotional abuse, or loss of a parent, may cause changes in the brain that increase the risk of depression. • Learned patterns of negative thinking. • Teen depression may be linked to learning to feel helpless — rather than learning to feel capable of finding solutions for life's challenges. • Many factors increase the risk of developing or triggering teen depression, including: Having issues that negatively impact self-esteem, such as obesity, peer problems, long-term bullying or academic problems Having been the victim or witness of violence, such as physical or sexual abuse Having other mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, a personality disorder, anorexia or bulimia Having a learning disability or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Having ongoing pain or a chronic physical illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma Having certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem or being overly dependent, self-critical or pessimistic Abusing alcohol, nicotine or other drugs Being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender in an unsupportive environment Family history and issues with family or others may also increase your teenager's risk of depression, such as: Having a parent, grandparent or other blood relative with depression, bipolar disorder or alcohol use problems Having a family member who died by suicide Having a family with major communication and relationship problems Having experienced recent stressful life events, such as parental divorce, parental military service or the death of a loved one Untreated depression can result in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your teenager's life. • Complications related to teen depression may include, for example: Alcohol and drug misuse Academic problems Family conflicts and relationship difficulties Suicide attempts or suicide There's no sure way to prevent depression. • However, these strategies may help. • Encourage your teenager to: Take steps to control stress, increase resilience and boost self-esteem to help handle issues when they arise Practice self-care, for example by creating a healthy sleep routine and using electronics responsibly and in moderation Reach out for friendship and social support, especially in times of crisis Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening Maintain ongoing treatment, if recommended, even after symptoms let up, to help prevent a relapse of depression symptoms",

      "Overview": "Temporal lobe seizures begin in the temporal lobes of the brain. • These areas process emotions and are important for short-term memory. • Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure often affect these functions . • Some people have odd feelings during the seizure, such as joy, deja vu or fear. • Temporal lobe seizures are sometimes called focal seizures with impaired awareness. • Some people are aware of what's going on during the seizure. • People who have more-intense seizures might look awake but won't respond to what's around them. • Their lips and hands may make motions over and over. • The cause of temporal lobe seizures often isn't known. • But it may stem from a scar in the temporal lobe. • Temporal lobe seizures are treated with medicine. • Some people who don't respond to medicine may have surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "An odd feeling called an aura may happen before a temporal lobe seizure. • An aura acts as a warning. • Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras. • And not everyone who has auras remembers them. • The aura is the first part of a focal seizure before a loss of consciousness. • Examples of auras include: A sudden sense of fear or joy. • A feeling that what's happening has happened before, known as deja vu. • A sudden or strange odor or taste. • A rising feeling in the belly that feels like being on a roller coaster Sometimes temporal lobe seizures keep people from responding to others. • This type of temporal lobe seizure most often lasts 30 seconds to 2 minutes. • Symptoms of a temporal lobe seizure include: Not being aware of the people and things around you. • Staring. • Lip smacking. • Swallowing or chewing over and over. • Finger movements, such as picking motions. • After a temporal lobe seizure, you may: Be confused and have trouble speaking for a time. • Be unable to recall what happened during the seizure. • Be unaware of having had a seizure. • Be very sleepy. • Sometimes, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure becomes a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. • This type of seizure causes shaking, known as convulsions, and loss of consciousness. • It also is called a grand mal seizure. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. • Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. • A second seizure follows right away. • Recovery isn't complete after the seizure. • Recovery is slower than usual after the seizure. • You're pregnant. • You have diabetes. • An injury happens during the seizure. • For a first seizure, see a healthcare professional. • Seek medical advice if: You think you or your child has had a seizure. • You have more seizures or more-intense seizures. • You have new seizure symptoms. • Often, experts don't know the cause of temporal lobe seizures. • But they can be a result of the following factors: Traumatic brain injury. • Infections such as encephalitis and meningitis, or a history of such infections. • A process that causes scarring in a part of the temporal lobes called the hippocampus. • This is known as gliosis. • Blood vessels in the brain that aren't formed correctly, called vascular malformations. • Stroke. • Brain tumors. • Genetic syndromes. • Withdrawal from alcohol overuse. • During waking and sleeping, the brain cells have electrical activity. • A burst of electrical activity in many brain cells may cause a seizure. • If this burst happens in just one area of the brain, the result is a focal seizure. • A temporal lobe seizure is a focal seizure that starts in one of the temporal lobes. • There are several risk factors for temporal lobe seizure. • They pose the most risk if they happen early in life. • These risk factors include: Brain injury. • Infections such as encephalitis or meningitis. • A seizure caused by a fever, called a febrile seizure. • Over time, repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause the part of the brain involved in learning and memory to shrink. • This area of the brain is called the hippocampus. • The loss of brain cells in the hippocampus may cause memory problems.",

      "Overview": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, life-threatening skin reaction, usually caused by a medication. • It's a severe form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). • In people with SJS, TEN is diagnosed when more than 30% of the skin surface is affected and the moist linings of the body (mucous membranes) have extensive damage. • TEN is a life-threatening condition that affects people of all ages. • TEN is usually treated in a hospital. • While the skin heals, supportive care includes controlling pain, caring for wounds and making sure you're getting enough fluids. • Recovery can take weeks to months. • If your condition was caused by a medication, you'll need to permanently avoid that drug and those related to it.",
      "Symptoms": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis signs and symptoms include: Widespread skin pain A spreading rash covering more than 30% of the body Blisters and large areas of peeling skin Sores, swelling and crusting on the mucous membranes, including the mouth, eyes and vagina Early treatment is key for people with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). • If you have symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. • You'll likely need care from a skin specialist (dermatologist) and other experts in a hospital.",
      "Causes": "SJS/TEN is usually caused by a skin reaction to medicine. • The symptoms are likely to start showing up one to four weeks after you start taking a new drug. • The most common drug triggers of SJS/TEN include antibiotics, epilepsy drugs, sulfa drugs and allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim).",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase your risk of SJS/TEN include: HIV infection. • Among people with HIV, the incidence of SJS/TEN is about 100 times greater than that among the general population. • A weakened immune system. • The immune system can be affected by an organ transplant, HIV/AIDS and autoimmune diseases. • Cancer. • People with cancer, especially blood cancers (hematologic malignancies), are at increased risk of SJS/TEN. • A history of SJS/TEN. • If you've had a medication-related form of this condition, you are at risk of a recurrence if you use that drug again. • A family history of SJS/TEN. • If a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, has had SJS/TEN, you may be more susceptible to developing it too. • Genetic factors. • Having certain genetic variations puts you at increased risk of SJS/TEN, especially if you're also taking drugs for seizures, gout or mental illness.",
      "Complications": "People at highest risk of TEN complications are those over age 70 and those who have liver cirrhosis or spreading (metastatic) cancer. • Complications of TEN include: Blood infection (sepsis). • Sepsis occurs when bacteria from an infection enter your bloodstream and spread throughout your body. • Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition that can cause shock and organ failure. • Lung involvement. • This can cause coughing, difficulty breathing and, with severe disease, acute respiratory failure. • Visual impairment. • TEN can cause eye problems, such as dry eye, ingrown eyelashes, corneal scarring and, rarely, blindness. • Permanent skin damage. • After recovering from TEN, your skin may have bumps, scars and discoloration. • Lasting skin problems might cause your hair to fall out, and your fingernails and toenails might not grow normally. • Vaginal sores. • In women, TEN can cause sores in the tissues lining the vagina, leading to pain or, if left untreated, vaginal fusion. • Emotional distress. • This condition causes distress and can have long-term psychological impact.",
      "Prevention": "To prevent another episode of TEN, learn whether it was caused by a medicine. • If so, never take that medicine or anything similar again. • A recurrence could be worse and life-threatening. • Also tell any future health care providers about your history of TEN, and wear a medic alert bracelet or necklace with information about your condition. • Or carry an allergy passport."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a tension-type headache include: Dull, aching head pain. • Feeling of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head. • Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles. • Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic. • Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. • Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. • This type of headache can become chronic. • This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be constant. • Chronic tension-type headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months. • Tension-type headaches can be hard to tell apart from migraines. • And if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you also can have migraines. • But unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances such as seeing bright spots or flashes of light. • People with tension-type headaches also don't usually experience nausea or vomiting with head pain. • While physical activity tends to make migraine pain worse, it doesn't affect tension-type headache pain. • Sometimes a tension-type headache occurs with sensitivity to light or sound, but this symptom isn't common. • See your health care professional if you need to take medicine for tension-type headaches more than twice a week. • Also make an appointment if tension-type headaches disrupt your life. • Even if you have a history of headaches, see your health care professional if the headache pattern changes. • Also see your care professional if your headaches suddenly feel different. • Occasionally, headaches may be caused by a serious medical condition. • These can include a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel, known as an aneurysm. • Get emergency care if you have any of these symptoms: A sudden, very bad headache. • Headache with a fever, stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness or trouble speaking. • Headache after a head injury, especially if the headache gets worse. • The cause of tension-type headaches is not known. • In the past, experts thought tension-type headaches were caused by muscle contractions in the face, neck and scalp. • They thought the muscle contractions were a result of emotions, tension or stress. • But research suggests that muscle contraction isn't the cause. • The most common theory is that people who have tension-type headaches have increased sensitivity to pain. • Muscle tenderness, a common symptom of tension-type headaches, may result from this sensitized pain system. • Stress is the most commonly reported trigger for tension-type headaches. • Most people experience a tension-type headache at some point in their lives. • However, some research has found that women are more likely to have frequent episodic tension-type headaches and chronic tension-type headaches. • Age also might play a factor. • One study found that episodic tension-type headaches were more likely to affect people in their 40s. • Because tension-type headaches are so common, they can have an effect on job productivity and quality of life, particularly if they're chronic. • Frequent headache pain may make it hard to attend activities. • You might need to stay home from work. • If you do go to your job, it may be hard to function as usual. • Regular exercise can help prevent tension-type headaches. • Other techniques also can help, such as: Biofeedback training. • This training teaches you to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. • A device monitors and gives you feedback on your muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. • You then learn how to reduce muscle tension and slow your heart rate and breathing. • Cognitive behavioral therapy. • This type of talk therapy may help you learn to manage stress. • Doing this may help you have fewer or less painful headaches. • Other relaxation techniques. • Anything that helps you relax may help your headaches. • This can include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation. • You can learn these methods in classes or at home using books or apps. • Using medicines along with stress management may be more effective than any one treatment in reducing your tension-type headaches. • Also, living a healthy lifestyle may help prevent headaches: Get enough, but not too much, sleep. • Don't smoke. • Stay physically active. • Eat regular, balanced meals. • Drink plenty of water. • Limit alcohol, caffeine and sugar.",

      "Overview": "Testicular cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the testicles. • The testicles, which are also called testes, are in the scrotum. • The scrotum is a loose bag of skin underneath the penis. • The testicles make sperm and the hormone testosterone. • Testicular cancer isn't a common type of cancer. • It can happen at any age, but it happens most often between the ages of 15 and 45. • The first sign of testicular cancer often is a bump or lump on a testicle. • The cancer cells can grow quickly. • They often spread outside the testicle to other parts of the body. • Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when it spreads to other parts of the body. • Treatments depend on the type of testicular cancer that you have and how far it has spread. • Common treatments include surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include: A lump or swelling in either testicle A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum A dull ache in the lower belly or groin Sudden swelling in the scrotum Pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum Enlargement or tenderness of the breast tissue Back pain Usually testicular cancer only happens in one testicle. • See your health care provider if you detect any symptoms that last longer than two weeks. • These include pain, swelling or lumps in your testicles or groin area. • It's not clear what causes most testicular cancers. • Testicular cancer starts when something causes changes to the DNA of testicle cells. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to grow and multiply quickly. • The cancer cells go on living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This causes a lot of extra cells in the testicle that can form a mass called a tumor. • In time, the tumor can grow beyond the testicle. • Some cells might break away and spread to other parts of the body. • Testicular cancer most often spreads to the lymph nodes, liver and lungs. • When testicular cancer spreads, it's called metastatic testicular cancer. • Nearly all testicular cancers begin in the germ cells. • The germ cells in the testicle make sperm. • It's not clear what causes DNA changes in the germ cells. • Factors that may increase your risk of testicular cancer include: Having an undescended testicle, which is called cryptorchidism. • The testes form in the belly during fetal development. • They typically descend into the scrotum before birth. • If you have a testicle that never descended, your risk of testicular cancer is higher. • The risk is increased even if you've had surgery to move the testicle to the scrotum. • Having a family history of testicular cancer. • If testicular cancer runs in your family, you might have an increased risk. • Being a young adult. • Testicular cancer can happen at any age. • But it's most common in teens and young adults between 15 and 45. • Being white. • Testicular cancer is most common in white people. • There's no way to prevent testicular cancer. • If you get testicular cancer, there's nothing you could have done to prevent it. • Some health care providers recommend regular testicle self-exams. • During a testicular self-exam you feel your testicles for any lumps or other changes. • Not all health care providers agree with this recommendation. • There's no research to show that self-exams can lower the risk of dying of testicular cancer. • Even when it is found at a late stage, testicular cancer is likely to be cured. • Still, you might find it helpful to become aware of the usual feel of your testicles. • You can do this by doing a testicular self-exam. • If you notice any changes that last longer than two weeks, make an appointment with your health care provider.",

      "Overview": "Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. • The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. • Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw. • Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. • There's no cure for tetanus. • Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. • Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. • The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. • It's more common in developing countries.",
      "Symptoms": "The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. • The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. • The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. • Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. • They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. • Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include: Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscles Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). • Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. • Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. • These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. • As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. • While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. • This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. • It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. • It also can progress to generalized tetanus. • Tetanus is a life-threatening disease. • If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care. • If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home. • Seek medical care in the following cases: You've not had a tetanus shot within 10 years. • You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot. • You have a puncture wound, a foreign object in your wound, an animal bite or a deep cut. • Your wound is contaminated with dirt, soil, feces, rust or saliva — or you have any doubt about whether you've cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure. • Contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if it's been five or more years since your last tetanus shot. • The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani. • The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces. • It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive. • When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are \"awakened.\" As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin. • The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles. • The greatest risk factor for tetanus infection is not being vaccinated or not keeping up with the 10-year booster shots. • Other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are: Cuts or wounds exposed to soil or manure A foreign body in a wound, such as a nail or splinter A history of immune-suppressing medical conditions Infected skin lesions in people living with diabetes An infected umbilical cord when a mother isn't fully vaccinated Shared and unsanitary needles for illegal drug use Complications of tetanus infection may include: Breathing problems. • Life-threatening breathing problems can occur from tightening of the vocal cords and muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen, especially during a generalized spasm. • Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). • A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches. • Pneumonia. • A lung infection caused by accidentally inhaling something into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia) may be a complication of generalized spasms. • Broken bones. • Generalized spasms may cause fractures of the spine or other bones. • Death. • Death from tetanus is often caused by a blocked airway during spasms or damage to the nerves that regulate breathing, heart rate or other organ functions. • You can prevent tetanus by being vaccinated. • The tetanus vaccine is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). • Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat. • Acellular pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection. • Children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called DT. • The DTaP is a series of five shots typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages: 2 months 4 months 6 months 15 to 18 months 4 to 6 years A booster shot is recommended for children at age 11 or 12. • This booster is called the Tdap vaccine. • If your child didn't get a booster shot as this age, talk to your doctor about appropriate options. • A booster shot is recommended for adults once every 10 years. • This may be one of two vaccines, Tdap or Td. • If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child or are unsure about your vaccination status, see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine. • A booster is recommended during the third trimester of a pregnancy, regardless of the mother's vaccination schedule. • Ask your doctor to review your vaccination status regularly. • Check whether you are current on your vaccination schedule if you are planning international travel.",

      "Overview": "Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW) is a rare heart condition that is present at birth. • That means it's a congenital heart defect. • A baby born with the condition has four different heart problems. • These heart problems affect the structure of the heart. • The condition causes altered blood flow through the heart and to the rest of the body. • Babies with tetralogy of Fallot often have blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. • Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. • If the heart changes and symptoms are mild, tetralogy of Fallot may not be noticed or diagnosed until adulthood. • People who are diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot need surgery to fix the heart. • They will need regular health checkups for life.",
      "Symptoms": "Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs. • Symptoms may include: Blue or gray skin color. • Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise. • Trouble gaining weight. • Getting tired easily during play or exercise. • Irritability. • Crying for long periods of time. • Fainting. • Some babies with tetralogy of Fallot suddenly develop deep blue or gray skin, nails, and lips. • This usually happens when the baby cries, eats or is upset. • These episodes are called tet spells. • Tet spells are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. • They are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old. • Tet spells may be less noticeable in toddlers and older children. • That's because they typically squat when they're short of breath. • Squatting sends more blood to the lungs. • Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after your child is born. • Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has these symptoms: Trouble breathing. • Bluish color of the skin. • Lack of alertness. • Seizures. • Weakness. • More irritable than usual. • If your baby becomes blue or gray, place your baby on the side and pull the baby's knees up to the chest. • This helps increase blood flow to the lungs. • Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.",
      "Causes": "Tetralogy of Fallot occurs as the baby's heart grows during pregnancy. • Usually, the cause is unknown. • Tetralogy of Fallot includes four problems with heart structure: Narrowing of the valve between the heart and the lungs, called pulmonary valve stenosis. • This condition reduces blood flow from the heart to the lungs. • The narrowing may just involve the valve. • Or it could happen in more than one place along the pathway between the heart and lungs. • Sometimes the valve isn't formed. • Instead, a solid sheet of tissue blocks blood flow from the right side of the heart. • This is called pulmonary atresia. • A hole between the bottom heart chambers, called a ventricular septal defect. • A ventricular septal defect changes how blood flows through the heart and lungs. • Oxygen-poor blood in the lower right chamber mixes with oxygen-rich blood in the lower left chamber. • The heart has to work harder to pump blood through the body. • The problem may weaken the heart over time. • Shifting of the body's main artery. • The body's main artery is called the aorta. • It's usually attached to the left lower heart chamber. • In tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is in the wrong place. • It's shifted to the right and sits directly above the hole in the heart wall. • This changes how blood flows from the aorta to the lungs. • Thickening of the right lower chamber of the heart, called right ventricular hypertrophy. • When the heart has to work too hard, the wall of the right lower heart chamber gets thick. • Over time, this may cause the heart to become weak and eventually fail. • Some people with tetralogy of Fallot have other problems that affect the aorta or heart arteries. • There also may be a hole between the heart's upper chambers, called atrial septal defect.",
      "Risk factors": "The exact cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown. • Some things may increase the risk of a baby being born with tetralogy of Fallot. • Risk factors include: Family history. • Having a virus during pregnancy. • This includes rubella, also known as German measles. • Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. • Eating poorly during pregnancy. • Smoking during pregnancy. • Mother's age older than 35. • Down syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome in the baby.",
      "Complications": "Untreated tetralogy of Fallot usually leads to life-threatening complications. • The complications may cause disability or death by early adulthood. • A possible complication of tetralogy of Fallot is infection of the inner lining of the heart or heart valves. • This is called infective endocarditis. • Sometimes antibiotics are given before dental work to prevent this type of infection. • Ask your healthcare team if preventive antibiotics are right for you or your baby. • Complications also are possible after surgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot. • But most people do well after such surgery. • When complications occur, they may include: Backward flow of blood through a heart valve. • Irregular heartbeats. • A hole in the heart that doesn't go away after surgery. • Changes in the size of the heart chambers. • Swelling of part of the aorta, called aortic root dilation. • Sudden cardiac death. • Another procedure or surgery may be needed to fix these complications. • People born with a complex congenital heart defect may be at risk for complications during pregnancy. • Talk to your healthcare team about the possible risks and complications of pregnancy. • Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed.",
      "Prevention": "Because the exact cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown, it may not be possible to prevent these conditions. • If you have a high risk of giving birth to a child with a congenital heart defect, genetic testing and screening may be done during pregnancy. • There are some steps you can take to help reduce your child's overall risk of birth defects, such as: Get proper prenatal care. • Regular checkups with a healthcare team during pregnancy can help keep mom and baby healthy. • Take a multivitamin with folic acid. • Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. • It may help reduce the risk of heart defects as well. • Don't drink or smoke. • These lifestyle habits can harm a baby's health. • Also avoid secondhand smoke. • Get a rubella (German measles) vaccine. • A rubella infection during pregnancy may affect a baby's heart development. • Get vaccinated before trying to get pregnant. • Control blood sugar. • If you have diabetes, good control of your blood sugar can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects. • Manage chronic health conditions. • If you have other health conditions, including phenylketonuria, talk to your healthcare team about the best way to treat and manage them. • Avoid harmful substances. • During pregnancy, have someone else do any painting and cleaning with strong-smelling products. • Check with your healthcare team before taking any medications. • Some medications can cause birth defects. • Tell your healthcare team about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription."

      "Overview": "A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the body's main artery in the chest. • The body's main artery is called the aorta. • When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may widen. • When the vessel is significantly widened, it's called an aneurysm. • A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm. • Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm may vary from regular health checkups to emergency surgery. • The type of treatment depends on the cause, size and growth rate of the thoracic aortic aneurysm. • Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm include rupture of the aorta or a life-threatening tear between the layers of the aorta's wall. • The tear is called an aortic dissection. • Rupture or dissection can lead to sudden death. • Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms that form in the lower part of the aorta, called abdominal aortic aneurysms.",
      "Symptoms": "Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. • There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. • Many start small and stay small. • Others grow bigger over time. • How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict. • As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include: Back pain. • Cough. • Weak, scratchy voice. • Shortness of breath. • Tenderness or pain in the chest. • Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include: Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads downward. • Pain in the chest, jaw, neck or arms. • Difficulty breathing. • Low blood pressure. • Loss of consciousness. • Shortness of breath. • Trouble swallowing. • Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection. • Most people with aortic aneurysms don't have symptoms unless a dissection or rupture occurs. • An aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture is a medical emergency. • Call 911 or your local emergency number for immediate help. • Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere in the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The aorta runs from the heart through the chest and belly area. • When an aneurysm occurs in the chest, it's called a thoracic aortic aneurysm. • If an aneurysm forms between the upper and lower parts of the aorta, it's called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. • A thoracic aneurysm may be round or tube-shaped. • Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart, in the aortic arch and in the lower part of the thoracic aorta. • Causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms may include: Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis. • Plaque buildup on the artery walls causes the arteries to become less flexible. • Additional pressure can cause the arteries to weaken and widen. • High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis. • This is more common in older people. • Genetic conditions. • Aortic aneurysms in younger people often have a genetic cause. • Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition that affects the connective tissue in the body, may cause weakness in the wall of the aorta. • Other genetic conditions linked to aortic aneurysm and dissection and rupture include vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz and Turner syndromes. • Blood vessel inflammation. • Conditions that involve blood vessel inflammation, such as giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms. • Irregular aortic valve. • The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the aorta. • People who are born with an aortic valve that has only two flaps instead of three have an increased risk of a thoracic aneurysm. • Untreated infection. • Though rare, it's possible to develop a thoracic aortic aneurysm if you've had an untreated infection, such as syphilis or salmonella. • Traumatic injury. • Rarely, some people who are injured in falls or motor vehicle crashes develop thoracic aortic aneurysms. • In aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta. • This causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall. • Sometimes the bleeding moves completely outside the aorta. • When this happens, it's called an aortic rupture. • An aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening emergency, depending on where in the aorta it occurs. • It's important to treat an aortic aneurysm to try to prevent dissection. • If dissection occurs, people can still be treated with surgery. • However, they typically have a higher risk of complications. • Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Age. • Growing older increases the risk of aortic aneurysms. • Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. • Tobacco use. • Smoking and using tobacco greatly increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm. • High blood pressure. • Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body, raising the risk of an aneurysm. • Buildup of plaques in the arteries. • The buildup of fat and other substances in the blood can damage the lining of a blood vessel, increasing the risk of an aneurysm. • This is a more common risk in older people. • Family history. • Having a parent, brother, sister or child with an aortic aneurysm increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm and rupture. • You may develop aneurysms at a younger age. • Genetic conditions. • If you have Marfan syndrome or a related condition, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, you have a significantly higher risk of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. • The risk also is increased for an aortic or other blood vessel dissection or rupture. • Bicuspid aortic valve. • Having an aortic valve with two cusps instead of three increases the risk of aortic aneurysm. • Tears in the wall of the aorta and rupture of the aorta are the main complications of thoracic aortic aneurysm. • However, some small and slow-growing aneurysms may never rupture. • In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture. • Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and rupture can include: Life-threatening bleeding inside the body. • This is called internal bleeding. • Emergency surgery is required to try to prevent death. • Blood clots. • Small blood clots can develop in the area of the aortic aneurysm. • If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. • This can possibly cause serious complications. • Stroke. • Signs and symptoms of stroke include weakness of or an inability to move one side of the body. • It may be difficult to speak. • Keeping the blood vessels as healthy as possible is important in preventing an aneurysm. • A health care provider may recommend these heart-healthy strategies: Don't smoke or use tobacco products. • Keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. • Get regular exercise. • Reduce cholesterol and fat in the diet. • There are no medicines to prevent an aortic aneurysm. • However, medicines may be used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other conditions linked to aneurysm. • Proper management of such conditions may lower the risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm complications. • Conditions that cause a thoracic aortic aneurysm may run in families. • A health care provider may recommend screening if a first-degree relative — such as a parent, brother, sister, son or daughter — has a genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or another condition linked to thoracic aortic aneurysms. • Screening means you have regular imaging tests, usually an echocardiogram, to check for an aneurysm. • If an ultrasound of the heart shows an enlarged aorta or an aneurysm, another imaging test is usually done within 6 to 12 months to make sure it hasn't grown. • Genetic testing also may be recommended if you have a family history of aortic aneurysms, particularly if you're considering pregnancy.",
      "Causes": "Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere in the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The aorta runs from the heart through the chest and belly area. • When an aneurysm occurs in the chest, it's called a thoracic aortic aneurysm. • If an aneurysm forms between the upper and lower parts of the aorta, it's called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. • A thoracic aneurysm may be round or tube-shaped. • Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart, in the aortic arch and in the lower part of the thoracic aorta. • Causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms may include: Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis. • Plaque buildup on the artery walls causes the arteries to become less flexible. • Additional pressure can cause the arteries to weaken and widen. • High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis. • This is more common in older people. • Genetic conditions. • Aortic aneurysms in younger people often have a genetic cause. • Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition that affects the connective tissue in the body, may cause weakness in the wall of the aorta. • Other genetic conditions linked to aortic aneurysm and dissection and rupture include vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz and Turner syndromes. • Blood vessel inflammation. • Conditions that involve blood vessel inflammation, such as giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms. • Irregular aortic valve. • The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the aorta. • People who are born with an aortic valve that has only two flaps instead of three have an increased risk of a thoracic aneurysm. • Untreated infection. • Though rare, it's possible to develop a thoracic aortic aneurysm if you've had an untreated infection, such as syphilis or salmonella. • Traumatic injury. • Rarely, some people who are injured in falls or motor vehicle crashes develop thoracic aortic aneurysms. • In aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta. • This causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall. • Sometimes the bleeding moves completely outside the aorta. • When this happens, it's called an aortic rupture. • An aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening emergency, depending on where in the aorta it occurs. • It's important to treat an aortic aneurysm to try to prevent dissection. • If dissection occurs, people can still be treated with surgery. • However, they typically have a higher risk of complications.",

      "Overview": "Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of conditions in which there's pressure on blood vessels or nerves in the area between the neck and shoulder. • This space is known as the thoracic outlet. • Compression of the blood vessels and nerves can cause shoulder and neck pain. • It also can cause numbness in the fingers. • Common causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include trauma from a car accident, repetitive injuries from a job or sport, and pregnancy. • Differences in anatomy, such as having an extra or irregular rib, also can cause TOS. • Sometimes the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is not known. • Treatment often involves physical therapy and pain relief. • Most people improve with these treatments. • For some, surgery may be recommended.",
      "Symptoms": "There are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome: Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. • This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome. • In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. • The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. • The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand. • Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. • This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. • This can result in blood clots. • Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. • This is the least common type of TOS. • It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. • The compression may cause injury to the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation. • Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. • When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: Numbness or tingling in the arm or fingers. • Pain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand. • Arm fatigue with activity. • A weakening grip. • Symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: A change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers. • Hand or arm pain and swelling. • Symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: A pulsating lump near the collarbone. • Cold fingers, hands or arms. • Hand and arm pain. • A change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand. • Weak or no pulse in the affected arm. • See your healthcare professional if you regularly experience any of the symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. • Thoracic outlet syndrome is often caused by compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet, the area between the neck and shoulder. • The cause of the compression varies and can include: Differences in anatomy. • Some people are born with an extra rib in the neck found above the first rib. • The extra rib, known as a cervical rib, can compress nerves or blood vessels. • There also may be a tight fibrous band connecting the spine to the rib that causes compression. • Poor posture. • Drooping your shoulders or holding your head in a forward position can cause compression in the thoracic outlet area. • Trauma. • A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then compress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. • The onset of symptoms related to a traumatic accident often is delayed. • There are several factors that seem to increase the risk of thoracic outlet syndrome, including: Sex. • Women are more than three times more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome than are men. • Age. • Thoracic outlet syndrome may occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. • Complications from this condition stem from the type of thoracic outlet syndrome. • If you have swelling or a painful discoloration in the arm, it is important to seek urgent medical attention. • You may need treatment for blood clots or an aneurysm. • For neurogenic TOS, repetitive nerve compression can result in long-term injury resulting in chronic pain or disability. • Neurogenic TOS can be confused for other joint or muscle injuries. • If symptoms don't improve, it is important to seek medical attention for an evaluation and testing. • If you're at risk of thoracic outlet compression, avoid repetitive movements and lifting heavy objects. • If you're overweight, losing weight may help you prevent or relieve symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. • Even if you don't have symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, avoid carrying heavy bags over your shoulder. • This can increase pressure on the thoracic outlet. • Stretch daily, and do exercises that keep your shoulder muscles strong and flexible. • Daily stretches focusing on the chest, neck and shoulders can help improve shoulder muscle strength and prevent thoracic outlet syndrome.",

      "Overview": "Thunderclap headaches live up to their name, striking suddenly like a clap of thunder. • The pain of these severe headaches peaks within 60 seconds. • Thunderclap headaches are uncommon, but they can warn of potentially life-threatening conditions — usually having to do with bleeding in and around the brain. • Seek emergency medical attention for a thunderclap headache.",
      "Symptoms": "Thunderclap headaches are dramatic. • Symptoms include pain that: Strikes suddenly and severely Peaks within 60 seconds Can be accompanied by nausea or vomiting Thunderclap headaches might be accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as: Altered mental state Fever Seizures These signs and symptoms might reflect the underlying cause. • Seek immediate medical attention for any headache that comes on suddenly and severely.",
      "Causes": "There's no obvious cause for some thunderclap headaches. • In other cases, a variety of potentially life-threatening conditions might be responsible, including: Bleeding between the brain and membranes covering the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) A rupture of a blood vessel in the brain A tear in the lining of an artery that supplies blood to the brain Leaking of cerebrospinal fluid — usually due to a tear of the covering around a nerve root in the spine Death of tissue or bleeding in the pituitary gland A blood clot in the brain Severe elevation in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) Infection such as meningitis or encephalitis Ischemic stroke"

      "Overview": "Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid. • The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. • The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. • Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. • But as it grows, it can cause signs and symptoms, such as swelling in your neck, voice changes and difficulty swallowing. • Several types of thyroid cancer exist. • Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive. • Most thyroid cancers can be cured with treatment. • Thyroid cancer rates seem to be increasing. • The increase may be caused by improved imaging technology that allows health care providers to find small thyroid cancers on CT and MRI scans done for other conditions (incidental thyroid cancers). • Thyroid cancers found in this way are usually small cancers that respond well to treatments.",
      "Symptoms": "Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. • As thyroid cancer grows, it may cause: A lump (nodule) that can be felt through the skin on your neck A feeling that close-fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight Changes to your voice, including increasing hoarseness Difficulty swallowing Swollen lymph nodes in your neck Pain in your neck and throat If you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider. • Thyroid cancer happens when cells in the thyroid develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes, which doctors call mutations, tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly. • The cells go on living when healthy cells would naturally die. • The accumulating cells form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade nearby tissue and can spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes in the neck. • Sometimes the cancer cells can spread beyond the neck to the lungs, bones and other parts of the body. • For most thyroid cancers, it's not clear what causes the DNA changes that cause the cancer. • Thyroid cancer is classified into types based on the kinds of cells found in the tumor. • Your type is determined when a sample of tissue from your cancer is examined under a microscope. • The type of thyroid cancer is considered in determining your treatment and prognosis. • Types of thyroid cancer include: Differentiated thyroid cancers. • This broad category includes types of thyroid cancer that start in the cells that produce and store thyroid hormones. • These cells are called follicular cells. • Differentiated thyroid cancers cells appear similar to healthy cells when viewed under a microscope. • Papillary thyroid cancer. • This is the most common type of thyroid cancer. • It can happen at any age, but it most often affects people ages 30 to 50. • Most papillary thyroid cancers are small and respond well to treatment, even if the cancer cells spread to the lymph nodes in the neck. • A small portion of papillary thyroid cancers are aggressive and may grow to involve structures in the neck or spread to other areas of the body. • Follicular thyroid cancer. • This rare type of thyroid cancer usually affects people older than 50. • Follicular thyroid cancer cells don't often spread to the lymph nodes in the neck. • But some large and aggressive cancers may spread to other parts of the body. • Follicular thyroid cancer most often spreads to the lungs and bones. • Hurthle cell thyroid cancer. • This rare type of thyroid cancer was once considered a type of follicular thyroid cancer. • Now it is considered its own type because the cancer cells behave differently and respond to different treatments. • Hurthle cell thyroid cancers are aggressive and can grow to involve structures in the neck and spread to other parts of the body. • Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. • This rare type of thyroid cancer is more aggressive than other differentiated thyroid cancers and often doesn't respond to the usual treatments. • Anaplastic thyroid cancer. • This rare type of thyroid cancer grows quickly and can be difficult to treat. • However, treatments can help slow the progression of the disease. • Anaplastic thyroid cancer tends to occur in people older than 60. • It can cause severe signs and symptoms, such as neck swelling that worsens very quickly and may lead to difficulty breathing and swallowing. • Medullary thyroid cancer. • This rare type of thyroid cancer begins in thyroid cells called C cells, which produce the hormone calcitonin. • Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood can indicate medullary thyroid cancer at a very early stage. • Some medullary thyroid cancers are caused by a gene called RET that's passed from parents to children. • Changes in the RET gene can cause familial medullary thyroid cancer and multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2. • Familial medullary thyroid cancer increases the risk of thyroid cancer. • Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2, increases the risk of thyroid cancer, adrenal gland cancer and other types of cancers. • Other rare types. • Other very rare types of cancer can start in the thyroid. • These include thyroid lymphoma, which begins in the immune system cells of the thyroid, and thyroid sarcoma, which begins in the connective tissue cells of the thyroid. • Factors that may increase the risk of thyroid cancer include: Female sex. • Thyroid cancer occurs more often in women than in men. • Experts think it may be related to the hormone estrogen. • People who are assigned female sex at birth generally have higher levels of estrogen in their bodies. • Exposure to high levels of radiation. • Radiation therapy treatments to the head and neck increase the risk of thyroid cancer. • Certain inherited genetic syndromes. • Genetic syndromes that increase the risk of thyroid cancer include familial medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia, Cowden syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. • Types of thyroid cancer that sometimes run in families include medullary thyroid cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. • Thyroid cancer can return despite successful treatment, and it can even come back if you've had your thyroid removed. • This could happen if cancer cells spread beyond the thyroid before it's removed. • Most thyroid cancers aren't likely to recur, including the most common types of thyroid cancer — papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer. • Your health care provider can tell you if your cancer has an increased risk of recurring based on the particulars of your cancer. • Recurrence is more likely if your cancer is aggressive or if it grows beyond your thyroid. • When thyroid cancer recurrence happens, it's usually found in the first five years after your initial diagnosis. • Thyroid cancer that comes back still has a good prognosis. • It's often treatable, and most people will have successful treatment. • Thyroid cancer may recur in: Lymph nodes in the neck Small pieces of thyroid tissue left behind during surgery Other areas of the body, such as the lungs and bones Your health care provider may recommend periodic blood tests or thyroid scans to check for signs that your cancer has returned. • At these appointments, your provider may ask if you've experienced any signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer recurrence, such as: Neck pain A lump in the neck Trouble swallowing Voice changes, such as hoarseness Thyroid cancer sometimes spreads to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. • The cancer cells that spread might be found when you're first diagnosed or they might be found after treatment. • The great majority of thyroid cancers don't ever spread. • When thyroid cancer spreads, it most often travels to: Lymph nodes in the neck Lungs Bones Brain Liver Skin Thyroid cancer that spreads might be detected on imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, when you're first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. • After successful treatment, your health care provider might recommend follow-up appointments to look for signs that your thyroid cancer has spread. • These appointments might include nuclear imaging scans that use a radioactive form of iodine and a special camera to detect thyroid cancer cells. • Doctors aren't sure what causes the gene changes that lead to most thyroid cancers, so there's no way to prevent thyroid cancer in people who have an average risk of the disease. • Adults and children with an inherited gene that increases the risk of medullary thyroid cancer may consider thyroid surgery to prevent cancer (prophylactic thyroidectomy). • Discuss your options with a genetic counselor who can explain your risk of thyroid cancer and your treatment options. • A medication that blocks the effects of radiation on the thyroid is sometimes provided to people living near nuclear power plants in the United States. • The medication (potassium iodide) could be used in the unlikely event of a nuclear reactor accident. • If you live within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant and are concerned about safety precautions, contact your state or local emergency management department for more information.",

      "Overview": "Tinnitus is when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears. • The noise you hear when you have tinnitus isn't caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it. • Tinnitus is a common problem. • It affects about 15% to 20% of people, and is especially common in older adults. • Tinnitus is usually caused by an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system. • For many people, tinnitus improves with treatment of the underlying cause or with other treatments that reduce or mask the noise, making tinnitus less noticeable.",
      "Symptoms": "Tinnitus is most often described as a ringing in the ears, even though no external sound is present. • However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including: Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. • The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. • In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. • Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. • In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. • This is called pulsatile tinnitus. • If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus). • Some people aren't very bothered by tinnitus. • For other people, tinnitus disrupts their daily lives. • If you have tinnitus that bothers you, see your doctor. • You develop tinnitus after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, and your tinnitus doesn't improve within a week. • You have hearing loss or dizziness with the tinnitus. • You are experiencing anxiety or depression as a result of your tinnitus. • A number of health conditions can cause or worsen tinnitus. • In many cases, an exact cause is never found. • In many people, tinnitus is caused by one of the following: Hearing loss. • There are tiny, delicate hair cells in your inner ear (cochlea) that move when your ear receives sound waves. • This movement triggers electrical signals along the nerve from your ear to your brain (auditory nerve). • Your brain interprets these signals as sound. • If the hairs inside your inner ear are bent or broken — this happens as you age or when you are regularly exposed to loud sounds — they can \"leak\" random electrical impulses to your brain, causing tinnitus. • Ear infection or ear canal blockage. • Your ear canals can become blocked with a buildup of fluid (ear infection), earwax, dirt or other foreign materials. • A blockage can change the pressure in your ear, causing tinnitus. • Head or neck injuries. • Head or neck trauma can affect the inner ear, hearing nerves or brain function linked to hearing. • Such injuries usually cause tinnitus in only one ear. • Medications. • A number of medications may cause or worsen tinnitus. • Generally, the higher the dose of these medications, the worse tinnitus becomes. • Often the unwanted noise disappears when you stop using these drugs. • Medications known to cause tinnitus include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain antibiotics, cancer drugs, water pills (diuretics), antimalarial drugs and antidepressants. • Less common causes of tinnitus include other ear problems, chronic health conditions, and injuries or conditions that affect the nerves in your ear or the hearing center in your brain. • Meniere's disease. • Tinnitus can be an early indicator of Meniere's disease, an inner ear disorder that may be caused by abnormal inner ear fluid pressure. • Eustachian tube dysfunction. • In this condition, the tube in your ear connecting the middle ear to your upper throat remains expanded all the time, which can make your ear feel full. • Ear bone changes. • Stiffening of the bones in your middle ear (otosclerosis) may affect your hearing and cause tinnitus. • This condition, caused by abnormal bone growth, tends to run in families. • Muscle spasms in the inner ear. • Muscles in the inner ear can tense up (spasm), which can result in tinnitus, hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. • This sometimes happens for no explainable reason, but can also be caused by neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis. • Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. • Problems with the TMJ, the joint on each side of your head in front of your ears, where your lower jawbone meets your skull, can cause tinnitus. • Acoustic neuroma or other head and neck tumors. • Acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops on the cranial nerve that runs from your brain to your inner ear and controls balance and hearing. • Other head, neck or brain tumors can also cause tinnitus. • Blood vessel disorders. • Conditions that affect your blood vessels — such as atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, or kinked or malformed blood vessels — can cause blood to move through your veins and arteries with more force. • These blood flow changes can cause tinnitus or make tinnitus more noticeable. • Other chronic conditions. • Conditions including diabetes, thyroid problems, migraines, anemia, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have all been associated with tinnitus. • Anyone can experience tinnitus, but these factors may increase your risk: Loud noise exposure. • Loud noises, such as those from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss. • Portable music devices, such as MP3 players, also can cause noise-related hearing loss if played loudly for long periods. • People who work in noisy environments — such as factory and construction workers, musicians, and soldiers — are particularly at risk. • Age. • As you age, the number of functioning nerve fibers in your ears declines, possibly causing hearing problems often associated with tinnitus. • Sex. • Men are more likely to experience tinnitus. • Tobacco and alcohol use. • Smokers have a higher risk of developing tinnitus. • Drinking alcohol also increases the risk of tinnitus. • Certain health problems. • Obesity, cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, and a history of arthritis or head injury all increase your risk of tinnitus. • Tinnitus affects people differently. • For some people, tinnitus can significantly affect quality of life. • If you have tinnitus, you may also experience: Fatigue Stress Sleep problems Trouble concentrating Memory problems Depression Anxiety and irritability Headaches Problems with work and family life Treating these linked conditions may not affect tinnitus directly, but it can help you feel better. • In many cases, tinnitus is the result of something that can't be prevented. • However, some precautions can help prevent certain kinds of tinnitus. • Use hearing protection. • Over time, exposure to loud sounds can damage the nerves in the ears, causing hearing loss and tinnitus. • Try to limit your exposure to loud sounds. • And if you cannot avoid loud sounds, use ear protection to help protect your hearing. • If you use chain saws, are a musician, work in an industry that uses loud machinery or use firearms (especially pistols or shotguns), always wear over-the-ear hearing protection. • Turn down the volume. • Long-term exposure to amplified music with no ear protection or listening to music at very high volume through headphones can cause hearing loss and tinnitus. • Take care of your cardiovascular health. • Regular exercise, eating right and taking other steps to keep your blood vessels healthy can help prevent tinnitus linked to obesity and blood vessel disorders. • Limit alcohol, caffeine and nicotine. • These substances, especially when used in excess, can affect blood flow and contribute to tinnitus.",

      "Overview": "The temporomandibular (tem-puh-roe-man-DIB-u-lur) joint, also called TMJ, acts like a sliding hinge. • It connects the jawbone to the skull. • There is one joint on each side of the jaw. • TMJ disorders — a type of temporomandibular disorder or TMD — can cause pain in the jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement. • The exact cause of TMJ disorder is often hard to determine. • The pain may be due to a mix of factors, including habits such as teeth clenching, gum chewing and nail biting; stress; and painful conditions that occur along with TMJ disorder such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis or jaw injury. • The habit of teeth clenching or grinding also is known as bruxism. • Most of the time, the pain and discomfort related to TMJ disorders lasts for only a limited time. • Self-managed home care, physical therapy for the jaw and the use of a mouth guard can be effective in treating symptoms of TMJ disorder. • Surgery is usually a last resort after conservative measures have failed. • But surgical treatments may help some people with TMJ disorders.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of TMJ disorders may include: Pain or tenderness in the jaw. • Pain in one or both temporomandibular joints. • Aching pain in and around the ear. • Having a hard time chewing or pain while chewing. • Aching facial pain. • Locking of the joint, making it hard to open or close your mouth. • Headache. • Neck pain. • Eye pain. • Tooth pain that occurs along with jaw tenderness. • TMJ disorders also can cause a clicking sound or grating sensation when you open your mouth or chew. • But if there's no pain or limitation of movement related to your jaw clicking, it's likely that you won't need treatment. • Seek medical attention if you have constant pain or tenderness in your jaw that occurs suddenly or during jaw movements or if you can't open or close your jaw completely. • Your dentist, TMJ specialist or other healthcare professional can discuss possible causes and treatments. • The temporomandibular joint combines a hinge action with sliding motions. • The parts of the bones that work together in the joint are covered with cartilage and separated by a small shock-absorbing disk. • This disk usually keeps the movement smooth. • Painful TMJ disorders can happen if: The disk erodes or moves out of its proper relationship between the ball and socket of the joint. • Sprain or strain occurs in the ligaments or soft tissues associated with TMJ disorders. • Arthritis damages the joint's cartilage. • A blow or another impact damages the joint. • Jaw muscles are associated with TMJ spasms. • Many times, the cause of TMJ disorder has a variety of causes and is hard to identify. • Factors that may raise the risk of getting TMJ disorders include: Different types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. • Jaw injury. • Habits such as gum chewing, nail biting, and grinding or clenching of teeth. • Certain connective tissue diseases. • Stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression. • Conditions such as fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis and sleep disturbances. • Smoking.",

      "Overview": "Tongue cancer is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the tongue. • The tongue begins in the throat and extends into the mouth. • It's made up of muscles and nerves that help with movement and function, such as taste. • The tongue aids in speaking, eating and swallowing. • Tongue cancer that starts in the mouth is different from tongue cancer that starts in the throat. • In the mouth, tongue cancer is called oral tongue cancer. • Tongue cancer in the mouth can cause symptoms right away. • A doctor, dentist or other member of your health care team might notice it first because this part of the tongue is easily seen and examined. • In the throat, tongue cancer is called oropharyngeal tongue cancer. • It may grow for a while before it causes symptoms. • When symptoms happen, they tend to be symptoms that have many possible causes. • If you have a sore throat or ear pain, your health care team might first check for causes other than cancer. • Cancer at the back of the tongue is hard to see and examine. • For these reasons, the cancer often isn't diagnosed right away. • It's often found after the cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes in the neck. • Several types of cancer can affect the tongue. • Tongue cancer most often begins in the thin, flat cells that line the surface of the tongue, called squamous cells. • Tongue cancer that starts in these cells is called squamous cell carcinoma. • Your health care team considers the type of cancer cells when making a treatment plan. • The team also considers the location and size of the cancer. • Tongue cancer treatment typically involves surgery and radiation therapy. • Other options might be chemotherapy and targeted therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Tongue cancer might not cause symptoms at first. • Sometimes it's found by a doctor or dentist who examines the mouth for signs of cancer as part of a checkup. • When tongue cancer happens in the mouth, the first sign is often a sore on the tongue that doesn't heal. • Other symptoms may include pain or bleeding in the mouth and a lump or thickening on the tongue. • When tongue cancer happens in the throat, the first sign can be swollen lymph nodes in the neck. • Other symptoms may include coughing up blood, weight loss and ear pain. • There also may be a lump in the back of the mouth, throat or neck. • Other tongue cancer symptoms may include: A red or white patch on the tongue or lining of the mouth. • A sore throat that doesn't go away. • A feeling that something is caught in the throat. • Numbness of the mouth or tongue. • Difficulty or pain with chewing, swallowing, or moving the jaws or tongue. • Swelling of the jaw. • A change in voice. • Make an appointment with a doctor, dentist or other health care professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Tongue cancer starts when healthy cells in the tongue develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cells to grow out of control and to continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. • This makes a lot of extra cells. • The cells can form a growth, called a tumor. • In time, the cells can break away and spread to other areas of the body. • It's not always clear what causes the changes that lead to tongue cancer. • For some tongue cancers that happen in the throat, human papillomavirus, also called HPV, can be involved. • HPV is a common virus that's transmitted through sexual contact. • Tongue cancer in the throat that's caused by HPV tends to respond better to treatment compared with tongue cancer in the throat that's not related to HPV.",
      "Risk factors": "The most common factors that can increase the risk of tongue cancer include: Tobacco use. • Tobacco is the single largest risk factor for tongue cancer. • All forms of tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, increase the risk. • Consuming alcohol. • Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of tongue cancer. • Using alcohol and tobacco together increases the risk even more. • Being exposed to HPV. • In recent years, tongue cancer in the throat has become more common in those exposed to specific types of HPV. • Other factors may include: Being male. • Men are more likely to develop tongue cancer than women. • This may be from higher rates of tobacco and alcohol use in men. • Increasing age. • People older than 45 have an increased risk of tongue cancer. • This is typically from years of tobacco and alcohol use. • Trouble maintaining oral hygiene. • Lack of dental care can contribute to tongue cancer. • The risk is even higher in those who use alcohol and tobacco. • Having a weak immune system. • This can happen if you take medicine to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. • It also can be caused by illness, such as infection with HIV.",
      "Prevention": "You can reduce your risk of tongue cancer by: Don't use tobacco. • If you don't use tobacco, don't start. • If you currently use tobacco of any kind, talk with your health care team about strategies to help you quit. • Limit alcohol intake. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Consider the HPV vaccine. • Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce your risk of HPV-related cancers, such as tongue cancer. • Ask your health care team whether an HPV vaccine is appropriate for you. • Have regular health and dental exams. • During your appointments, your dentist, doctor or other member of your health care team can check your mouth for signs of cancer and precancerous changes."

      "Overview": "Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a condition present at birth that restricts the tongue's range of motion. • With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. • Depending on how much the tissue restricts tongue movement, it may interfere with breastfeeding. • Someone who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out the tongue. • Tongue-tie can also affect eating or speaking. • Sometimes tongue-tie may not cause problems. • Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include: Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side. • Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth. • A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out. • See a doctor if: Your baby has signs of tongue-tie that cause problems, such as having trouble breastfeeding. • A speech-language pathologist thinks your child's speech is affected by tongue-tie. • Your older child complains of tongue problems that interfere with eating, speaking or reaching the back teeth. • You're bothered by your own symptoms of tongue-tie.",
      "Causes": "Typically, the lingual frenulum separates before birth, allowing the tongue free range of motion. • With tongue-tie, the lingual frenulum remains attached to the bottom of the tongue. • Why this happens is largely unknown, although some cases of tongue-tie have been associated with certain genetic factors.",
      "Risk factors": "Although tongue-tie can affect anyone, it's more common in boys than girls. • Tongue-tie sometimes runs in families.",
      "Complications": "Tongue-tie may affect a baby's oral development, as well as the way the child eats, speaks and swallows. • For example, tongue-tie can sometimes lead to: Breastfeeding problems. • Breastfeeding requires a baby to keep the tongue over the lower gum while sucking. • If unable to move the tongue or keep it in the right position, the baby might chew instead of suck on the nipple. • This can cause significant nipple pain and interfere with a baby's ability to get breast milk. • Ultimately, poor breastfeeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive. • Speech difficulties. • Tongue-tie can interfere with the ability to make certain sounds — such as \"t,\" \"d,\" \"z,\" \"s,\" \"th,\" \"n\" and \"l.\" Poor oral hygiene. • For an older child or adult, tongue-tie can make it difficult to sweep food debris from the teeth. • This can contribute to tooth decay and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). • Challenges with other oral activities. • Tongue-tie can interfere with activities such as licking an ice cream cone, licking the lips, kissing or playing a wind instrument."

      "Overview": "A tonic-clonic seizure, previously known as a grand mal seizure, causes a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. • It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures. • During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. • Seizures can be focal, meaning the burst of electrical activity happens in one area of the brain. • Or seizures can be generalized, in which they result in electrical activity in all areas of the brain. • Tonic-clonic seizures may begin as focal seizures in a small area of the brain and spread to become generalized seizures that involve the whole brain. • Focal and generalized seizures have different symptoms. • People who have generalized seizures usually lose consciousness. • But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness. • In tonic-clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall. • Then the muscles alternately flex and relax. • Usually, a tonic-clonic seizure is caused by epilepsy. • But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as a high fever or damage to the brain. • Some people who have a tonic-clonic seizure don’t have another one and don't need treatment. • But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medicines to control and prevent future tonic-clonic seizures. • Surgery and dietary changes also may be options to manage your seizures.",
      "Symptoms": "Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages: Tonic phase. • Often, someone in the tonic phase will make a sound, such as a groan or yell. • The muscles suddenly get stiff and cause the person to fall down. • Loss of consciousness occurs. • This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds. • Clonic phase. • The muscles go into rhythmic contractions. • The arms and legs often jerk. • They alternately flex and relax. • Convulsions usually last 1 to 2 minutes or less. • The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures: Loss of bowel and bladder function. • This may happen during or following a seizure. • Not responding after convulsions. • The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended. • Confusion. • The person often is disoriented after a tonic-clonic seizure. • This is referred to as postictal confusion. • Fatigue. • Sleepiness is common after a tonic-clonic seizure. • Bad headache. • Headaches may occur after a tonic-clonic seizure. • Call 911 or emergency medical help if: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. • Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. • A second seizure follows immediately. • You have a high fever. • You're experiencing heat exhaustion. • You're pregnant. • You have diabetes. • You've injured yourself during the seizure. • If you experience a seizure for the first time, see a healthcare professional. • Also see a healthcare professional if you or your child: Experiences an increasing number of seizures for no apparent reason. • Notices new seizure symptoms. • The brain's nerve cells typically communicate by sending electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect the cells. • A synapse is the area between cells that allows them to send messages. • Tonic-clonic seizures occur when there's a surge of electrical activity over the surface of the brain. • Many nerve cells fire at once, much faster than usual. • Exactly what causes these changes often is not known. • However, tonic-clonic seizures are sometimes caused by other health problems, such as: Injury or infection. • Severe head injuries can cause tonic-clonic seizures. • Other possible causes include infections, such as encephalitis or meningitis, or having these infections in the past. • Stroke and dementias that cause degeneration in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, also can cause tonic-clonic seizures. • Congenital or developmental factors. • These can include blood vessels that don't form properly in the brain and brain tumors. • Metabolic issues. • Very low blood levels of glucose, sodium, calcium or magnesium can cause tonic-clonic seizures. • Withdrawal syndromes. • These can include using or withdrawing from drugs, including alcohol. • Risk factors for tonic-clonic seizures include: A family history of seizure disorders. • Any injury to the brain from trauma, a stroke, previous infection and other causes. • Sleep deprivation. • Medical problems that affect the balance of minerals in the body. • Illicit drug use. • Heavy alcohol use. • Having a seizure at certain times can be dangerous for you or others. • You might be at risk of: Falling. • If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. • Drowning. • If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you're at risk of accidental drowning. • Car accidents. • A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. • Pregnancy complications. • Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby. • And certain anti-seizure medicines increase the risk of birth defects. • If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, talk with a healthcare professional. • Your medicines may need to be adjusted. • A healthcare professional likely will monitor your pregnancy. • Emotional health issues. • People with seizures are more likely to have depression and anxiety. • Children with seizures may be more likely to develop attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, also called ADHD. • Emotional health issues may be a result of dealing with the condition itself or as a result of medicine side effects.",

      "Overview": "Tourette (too-RET) syndrome is a disorder that involves repetitive movements or unwanted sounds (tics) that can't be easily controlled. • For instance, you might repeatedly blink your eyes, shrug your shoulders or blurt out unusual sounds or offensive words. • Tics typically show up between ages 2 and 15, with the average being around 6 years of age. • Males are about three to four times more likely than females to develop Tourette syndrome. • Although there's no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are available. • Many people with Tourette syndrome don't need treatment when symptoms aren't troublesome. • Tics often lessen or become controlled after the teen years.",
      "Symptoms": "Tics — sudden, brief, intermittent movements or sounds — are the hallmark sign of Tourette syndrome. • They can range from mild to severe. • Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life. • Tics are classified as: Simple tics. • These sudden, brief and repetitive tics involve a limited number of muscle groups. • Complex tics. • These distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involve several muscle groups. • Tics can also involve movement (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). • Motor tics usually begin before vocal tics do. • But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse. • In addition, tics can: Vary in type, frequency and severity Worsen if you're ill, stressed, anxious, tired or excited Occur during sleep Change over time Worsen in the early teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood Before the onset of motor or vocal tics, you'll likely experience an uncomfortable bodily sensation (premonitory urge) such as an itch, a tingle or tension. • Expression of the tic brings relief. • With great effort, some people with Tourette syndrome can temporarily stop or hold back a tic. • See your child's pediatrician if you notice your child displaying involuntary movements or sounds. • Not all tics indicate Tourette syndrome. • Many children develop tics that go away on their own after a few weeks or months. • But whenever a child shows unusual behavior, it's important to identify the cause and rule out serious health problems. • The exact cause of Tourette syndrome isn't known. • It's a complex disorder likely caused by a combination of inherited (genetic) and environmental factors. • Chemicals in the brain that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters), including dopamine and serotonin, might play a role. • Risk factors for Tourette syndrome include: Family history. • Having a family history of Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders might increase the risk of developing Tourette syndrome. • Sex. • Males are about three to four times more likely than females to develop Tourette syndrome. • People with Tourette syndrome often lead healthy, active lives. • However, Tourette syndrome frequently involves behavioral and social challenges that can harm your self-image. • Conditions often associated with Tourette syndrome include: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Autism spectrum disorder Learning disabilities Sleep disorders Depression Anxiety disorders Pain related to tics, especially headaches Anger-management problems",

      "Overview": "Toxic hepatitis is an inflammation of your liver in reaction to certain substances to which you're exposed. • Toxic hepatitis can be caused by alcohol, chemicals, drugs or nutritional supplements. • In some cases, toxic hepatitis develops within hours or days of exposure to a toxin. • In other cases, it may take months of regular use before signs and symptoms appear. • The symptoms of toxic hepatitis often go away when exposure to the toxin stops. • But toxic hepatitis can permanently damage your liver, leading to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and in some cases to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.",
      "Symptoms": "Mild forms of toxic hepatitis may not cause any symptoms and may be detected only by blood tests. • When signs and symptoms of toxic hepatitis occur, they may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) Itching Abdominal pain in the upper right portion of the abdomen Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Rash Fever Weight loss Dark or tea-colored urine See your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. • Overdoses of some medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), can lead to liver failure. • Get immediate medical care if you think an adult or a child has taken an overdose of acetaminophen. • Signs and symptoms of a possible acetaminophen overdose include: Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Upper abdominal pain Coma If you suspect an acetaminophen overdose, immediately call 911, your local emergency services, or the poison help line. • There are two ways to get help from Poison Control in the U.S: online at www.poison.org or by calling 800-222-1222. • Both options are free, confidential, and available 24 hours a day. • Do not wait for symptoms to develop. • An acetaminophen overdose can be fatal but can be successfully treated if addressed early after ingestion. • Toxic hepatitis occurs when your liver develops inflammation because of exposure to a toxic substance. • Toxic hepatitis may also develop when you take too much of a prescription or over-the-counter medication. • The liver normally removes and breaks down most drugs and chemicals from your bloodstream. • Breaking down toxins creates byproducts that can damage the liver. • Although the liver has a great capacity for regeneration, constant exposure to toxic substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible harm. • Toxic hepatitis can be caused by: Alcohol. • Heavy drinking over many years can lead to alcoholic hepatitis — inflammation in the liver due to alcohol, which can lead to liver failure. • Over-the-counter pain relievers. • Nonprescription pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) can damage your liver, especially if taken frequently or combined with alcohol. • Prescription medications. • Some medications linked to serious liver injury include the statin drugs used to treat high cholesterol, the combination drug amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), niacin (Niaspan), ketoconazole, certain antivirals and anabolic steroids. • There are many others. • Herbs and supplements. • Some herbs considered dangerous to the liver include aloe vera, black cohosh, cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava and ephedra. • There are many others. • Children can develop liver damage if they mistake vitamin supplements for candy and take large doses. • Industrial chemicals. • Chemicals you may be exposed to on the job can cause liver injury. • Common chemicals that can cause liver damage include the dry cleaning solvent carbon tetrachloride, a substance called vinyl chloride (used to make plastics), the herbicide paraquat and a group of industrial chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls. • Factors that may increase your risk of toxic hepatitis include: Taking over-the-counter pain relievers or certain prescription drugs. • Taking a medication or over-the-counter pain reliever that carries a risk of liver damage increases your risk of toxic hepatitis. • This is especially true if you take multiple medications or take more than the recommended dose of medication. • Having a liver disease. • Having a serious liver disorder such as cirrhosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease makes you much more susceptible to the effects of toxins. • Having hepatitis. • Chronic infection with a hepatitis virus (hepatitis B, hepatitis C or one of the other — extremely rare — hepatitis viruses that may persist in the body) makes your liver more vulnerable. • Aging. • As you age, your liver breaks down harmful substances more slowly. • This means that toxins and their byproducts stay in your body longer. • Drinking alcohol. • Drinking alcohol while taking medications or certain herbal supplements increases the risk of toxicity. • Being female. • Because women seem to metabolize certain toxins more slowly than men do, their livers are exposed to higher blood concentrations of harmful substances for a longer time. • This increases the risk of toxic hepatitis. • Having certain genetic mutations. • Inheriting certain genetic mutations that affect the production and action of the liver enzymes that break down toxins may make you more susceptible to toxic hepatitis. • Working with industrial toxins. • Working with certain industrial chemicals puts you at risk of toxic hepatitis. • The inflammation associated with toxic hepatitis can lead to liver damage and scarring. • Over time, this scarring, called cirrhosis, makes it difficult for your liver to do its job. • Eventually cirrhosis leads to liver failure. • The only treatment for chronic liver failure is to replace your liver with a healthy one from a donor (liver transplant). • Because it's not possible to know how you'll react to a particular medication, toxic hepatitis can't always be prevented. • But you may reduce your risk of liver problems if you: Limit medications. • Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when absolutely necessary. • Investigate nondrug options for common problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and arthritis pain. • Take medications only as directed. • Follow the directions exactly for any drug you take. • Don't exceed the recommended amount, even if your symptoms don't seem to improve. • Because the effects of over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes wear off quickly, it's easy to take too much. • Be cautious with herbs and supplements. • Don't assume that a natural product won't cause harm. • Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor before taking herbs and supplements. • The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox website, where you can look up medications and supplements to see if they're linked to liver damage. • Don't mix alcohol and drugs. • Alcohol and medications are a bad combination. • If you're taking acetaminophen, don't drink alcohol. • Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the interaction between alcohol and other prescription and nonprescription drugs you use. • Take precautions with chemicals. • If you work with or use hazardous chemicals, take all necessary precautions to protect yourself from exposure. • If you do come in contact with a harmful substance, follow the guidelines in your workplace, or call your local emergency services or your local poison control center for help. • Keep medications and chemicals away from children. • Keep all medications and vitamin supplements away from children and in childproof containers so that children can't accidentally swallow them.",
      "Causes": "Toxic hepatitis occurs when your liver develops inflammation because of exposure to a toxic substance. • Toxic hepatitis may also develop when you take too much of a prescription or over-the-counter medication. • The liver normally removes and breaks down most drugs and chemicals from your bloodstream. • Breaking down toxins creates byproducts that can damage the liver. • Although the liver has a great capacity for regeneration, constant exposure to toxic substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible harm. • Toxic hepatitis can be caused by: Alcohol. • Heavy drinking over many years can lead to alcoholic hepatitis — inflammation in the liver due to alcohol, which can lead to liver failure. • Over-the-counter pain relievers. • Nonprescription pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) can damage your liver, especially if taken frequently or combined with alcohol. • Prescription medications. • Some medications linked to serious liver injury include the statin drugs used to treat high cholesterol, the combination drug amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), niacin (Niaspan), ketoconazole, certain antivirals and anabolic steroids. • There are many others. • Herbs and supplements. • Some herbs considered dangerous to the liver include aloe vera, black cohosh, cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava and ephedra. • There are many others. • Children can develop liver damage if they mistake vitamin supplements for candy and take large doses. • Industrial chemicals. • Chemicals you may be exposed to on the job can cause liver injury. • Common chemicals that can cause liver damage include the dry cleaning solvent carbon tetrachloride, a substance called vinyl chloride (used to make plastics), the herbicide paraquat and a group of industrial chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls.",

      "Overview": "Toxoplasmosis (tok-so-plaz-MOE-sis) is an infection with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. • People often get the infection from eating undercooked meat. • You can also get it from contact with cat feces. • The parasite can pass to a baby during pregnancy. • Most people infected with the parasite do not have symptoms. • Some people get flu-like symptoms. • Serious disease most often affects infants and people with weakened immune systems. • Toxoplasmosis during pregnancy may cause miscarriage and birth defects. • Most infections don't need treatment. • Drug treatment is used for people with more-serious cases, pregnant people, newborns and people with weakened immune systems. • Several steps to prevent toxoplasmosis can lower the risk of infection.",
      "Symptoms": "Most people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms. • They often don't know they're infected. • Some people have flu-like symptoms, including: Fever. • Swollen lymph nodes that may last for weeks. • Headache. • Muscle aches. • Skin rash. • The toxoplasma parasites may infect tissues of the inner eye. • This can occur in people with healthy immune systems. • But the disease is more serious in people with weakened immunity. • An infection in the eye is called ocular toxoplasmosis. • Symptoms may include: Eye pain. • Poor vision. • Floaters, which are specks that seem to swim in your vision. • Untreated eye disease can cause blindness. • People with weakened immune systems are likely to have more-serious disease from toxoplasmosis. • A toxoplasmosis infection from earlier in life may become active again. • People at risk include those living with HIV/AIDS, people receiving cancer treatment and people with a transplanted organ. • In addition to serious eye disease, toxoplasmosis can cause severe lung or brain disease for a person with weakened immunity. • Rarely, the infection can show up in other tissues throughout the body. • Lung infection may cause: Breathing problems. • Fever. • Cough. • Toxoplasmosis may cause inflammation of the brain, also called encephalitis. • Symptoms may include: Confusion. • Poor coordination. • Muscle weakness. • Seizures. • Changes in alertness. • Toxoplasmosis can pass from the mother to the fetus during a pregnancy. • This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. • Infection during the first trimester often causes more-severe disease. • It also may result in miscarriage. • For some babies with toxoplasmosis, serious disease may be present at birth or appear early in infancy. • Medical problems may include: Too much fluid in or around the brain, also called hydrocephalus. • Severe eye infection. • Irregularities in brain tissues. • An enlarged liver or spleen. • Symptoms of severe disease vary. • They may include: Problems with mental or motor skills. • Blindness or other vision problems. • Hearing problems. • Seizures. • Heart disorders. • Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, also called jaundice. • Rash. • Most babies with toxoplasmosis do not show symptoms. • But problems may show up later in childhood or teenage years. • These include: Return of eye infections. • Problems with motor skill development. • Problems with thinking and learning. • Hearing loss. • Slowed growth. • Early puberty. • Talk to your health care provider about a test if you are worried about exposure to the parasite. • If you are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant, see your provider if you suspect exposure. • The symptoms of severe toxoplasmosis include blurred vision, confusion and loss of coordination. • These need immediate medical care, particularly if you have a weakened immune system. • Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect most animals and birds. • It can only go through the entire cycle of reproduction in domestic and wild cats. • These are the main hosts for the parasite. • Immature eggs, a middle stage of reproduction, can be in the feces of cats. • This immature egg allows for the parasite to make its way through the food chain. • It can pass from soil and water to plants, animals and humans. • Once the parasite has a new host, the reproduction cycle goes on and causes an infection. • If you're in typical health, your immune system keeps the parasites in check. • They stay in your body but are not active. • This often gives you lifelong immunity. • If you're exposed to the parasite again, your immune system would clear it out. • If your immune system is weakened later in life, parasite reproduction can start again. • This causes a new active infection that can lead to serious disease and complications. • People often get a toxoplasma infection one of the following ways: Cat feces with the parasite. • Cats that hunt or who are fed raw meat are more likely to carry toxoplasma parasites. • You may get infected if you touch your mouth after touching anything that has been in contact with cat feces. • This may be gardening or cleaning a litter box. • Contaminated food or water. • Undercooked beef, lamb, pork, venison, chicken and shellfish are all known carriers of the parasite. • Unpasteurized goat milk and untreated drinking water also may be carriers. • Unwashed fruits and vegetables. • The surface of fruits and vegetables may have the parasite on them. • Contaminated kitchen tool. • Parasites may be on cutting boards, knives and other utensils that come into contact with raw meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables. • Infected organ transplant or transfused blood. • Rarely, toxoplasma parasites are passed through an organ transplant or blood transfusion. • The parasite is found throughout the world. • Anyone can become infected. • Risks of serious disease from toxoplasmosis include things that prevent the immune system from fighting infections, such as: Infection with HIV/AIDS. • Chemotherapy treatment for cancer. • High-dose steroids. • Drugs that prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. • Certain precautions can help prevent toxoplasmosis: Wear gloves when you garden or handle soil. • Wear gloves when you work outdoors. • Wash your hands with soap and water afterward. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meat. • Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough. • Cook whole meats and fish to at least 145 F (63 C) and let rest for at least three minutes. • Cook ground meat to at least 160 F (71 C). • Cook whole and ground poultry to at least 165 F (74 C). • Don't eat raw shellfish. • Do not eat raw clams, mussels or oysters, particularly during pregnancy. • Wash kitchen utensils thoroughly. • Wash cutting boards, knives and other utensils with soapy water after contact with raw meats or unwashed fruits and vegetables. • Wash your hands thoroughly before and after preparing foods. • Wash all fruits and vegetables. • Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before eating, peeling or cooking. • Don't drink unpasteurized goat milk. • Avoid unpasteurized goat milk or products made from the milk. • Don't drink untreated water. • During pregnancy, do not drink untreated water. • Cover children's sandboxes. • Cover sandboxes to prevent outdoor cats from using them as litter boxes. • If you're pregnant or otherwise at risk of toxoplasmosis, take these steps to protect yourself: Help your cat stay healthy. • Keep your cat indoors. • Feed it dry or canned cat food, not raw or undercooked meat. • Avoid stray cats or kittens. • Avoid stray cats, especially kittens. • Do not get a new cat when you're pregnant. • Have someone else clean the litter box. • Clean the box daily, if possible. • If someone else can't clean it, wear gloves and a face mask to change the litter. • Then wash your hands well.",

      "Overview": "Trachoma (truh-KOH-muh) is a bacterial infection that affects your eyes. • It's caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. • Trachoma is contagious, spreading through contact with the eyes, eyelids, and nose or throat secretions of infected people. • It can also be passed on by handling infected items, such as handkerchiefs. • At first, trachoma may cause mild itching and irritation of your eyes and eyelids. • Then you may notice swollen eyelids and pus draining from the eyes. • Untreated trachoma can lead to blindness. • Trachoma is the leading preventable cause of blindness worldwide. • Most trachoma cases occur in poor areas of Africa, where 85% of people with active disease reside. • In areas where trachoma is prevalent, infection rates among children under 5 can be 60% or more. • Early treatment may help prevent trachoma complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include: Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. • But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood. • The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma: Inflammation — follicular. • The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). • Inflammation — intense. • In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. • Eyelid scarring. • Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. • The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. • Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). • In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). • The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). • Corneal clouding (opacity). • The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. • Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea. • All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. • Without intervention, a disease process that begins in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood. • Call your doctor if you or your child has itchy or irritated eyes or discharge from the eyes, especially if you live in or recently traveled to an area where trachoma is common. • Trachoma is a contagious condition. • Treating it as soon as possible helps prevent serious infection.",
      "Causes": "Trachoma is caused by certain subtypes of Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacterium that can also cause the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia. • Trachoma spreads through contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. • Hands, clothing, towels and insects can all be routes for transmission. • In developing countries, eye-seeking flies also are a means of transmission.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that increase your risk of contracting trachoma include: Crowded living conditions. • People living in close contact are at greater risk of spreading infection. • Poor sanitation. • Poor sanitary conditions, inadequate access to water, and lack of hygiene, such as unclean faces or hands, help spread the disease. • Age. • In areas where the disease is active, it's most common in children ages 4 to 6. • Sex. • In some areas, women's rate of contracting the disease is two to six times higher than that of men. • This may be attributed to the fact that women have more contact with children, who are the primary reservoir of infection. • Flies. • People living in areas with problems controlling the fly population may be more susceptible to infection.",
      "Complications": "One episode of trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is easily treated with early detection and use of antibiotics. • Repeated or secondary infections can lead to complications, including: Scarring of the inner eyelid Eyelid deformities, such as an inward-folding eyelid (entropion) or ingrown eyelashes (trichiasis), which can scratch the cornea Corneal scarring or cloudiness Partial or complete vision loss",
      "Prevention": "If you've been treated for trachoma with antibiotics or surgery, reinfection is always a concern. • For your protection and for the safety of others, be sure that family members or others you live with are screened and, if necessary, treated for trachoma. • Trachoma can occur worldwide but is more common in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. • When in regions where trachoma is common, take extra care in practicing good hygiene, which can help prevent infection. • Proper hygiene practices include: Face washing and hand-washing. • Keeping faces and hands clean may help break the cycle of reinfection. • Fly control. • Reducing fly populations can help eliminate a source of transmission. • Proper waste management. • Properly disposing of animal and human waste can reduce breeding grounds for flies. • Improved access to water. • Having a fresh water source nearby can help improve hygienic conditions. • No trachoma vaccine is available, but prevention is possible. • The WHO has developed a strategy to prevent trachoma, with the goal of eliminating it by 2020. • While the goal hasn't been entirely achieved, trachoma cases have declined sharply. • The strategy, titled SAFE, involves: Surgery to treat advanced forms of trachoma Antibiotics to treat and prevent the infection Facial cleanliness Environmental improvements, particularly in water, sanitation and fly control"

      "Overview": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a short period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. • It's caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. • A TIA usually lasts only a few minutes and doesn't cause long-term damage. • However, a TIA may be a warning. • About 1 in 3 people who has a TIA will eventually have a stroke, with about half occurring within a year after the TIA. • Often called a ministroke, a TIA can serve as both a warning of a future stroke and a chance to prevent it.",
      "Symptoms": "Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes. • Most symptoms disappear within an hour. • Rarely, symptoms may last up to 24 hours. • The symptoms of a TIA are similar to those found early in a stroke. • Symptoms happen suddenly and may include: Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg, typically on one side of the body. • Slurred speech or trouble understanding others. • Blindness in one or both eyes or double vision. • Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination. • You may have more than one TIA. • Their symptoms may be similar or different depending on which area of the brain is involved. • If you think you're having or have had a transient ischemic attack, get medical attention right away. • TIAs most often occur hours or days before a stroke. • Being evaluated quickly means healthcare professionals can pinpoint potential treatable conditions. • Treating those conditions may help you prevent a stroke. • The cause of a transient ischemic attack is similar to the cause of an ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke. • In an ischemic stroke, a blood clot blocks the blood supply to part of the brain. • In a TIA, unlike a stroke, the blockage is brief and there is no permanent damage. • The blockage that occurs during a TIA often results from a buildup of cholesterol-containing fatty deposits called plaques in an artery. • This is known as atherosclerosis. • The buildup also may occur in an artery's branches that supply oxygen and nutrients to the brain. • Plaques can decrease the blood flow through an artery or lead to the development of a clot. • A blood clot that moves from another part of the body, such as the heart, to an artery that supplies the brain also may cause a TIA. • Some risk factors of a transient ischemic attack and stroke can't be changed. • Others you can control. • You can't change these risk factors of a TIA and stroke. • But knowing you have these risks can motivate you to change the risk factors you can control. • Family history. • Your risk may be greater if one of your family members has had a TIA or a stroke. • Age. • Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 55. • Sex. • Men have a slightly higher risk of a TIA and a stroke. • But as women age, their risk of a stroke goes up. • Prior transient ischemic attack. • If you've had one or more TIAs, you're much more likely to have a stroke. • Sickle cell disease. • Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, also known as sickle cell anemia. • Sickle-shaped blood cells carry less oxygen and also tend to get stuck in artery walls, affecting blood flow to the brain. • But with proper treatment of sickle cell disease, you can lower your risk of a stroke. • You can control or treat a number of risk factors of a TIA and a stroke, including certain health conditions and lifestyle choices. • Having one or more of these risk factors doesn't mean you'll have a stroke, but your risk increases if you have two or more of them. • High blood pressure. • The risk of a stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings of 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and higher. • Your healthcare professional can help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age and other factors, such as whether you have diabetes. • High cholesterol. • Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fat, may reduce the plaques in your arteries. • If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, your provider may prescribe a statin or another type of cholesterol-lowering medicine. • Cardiovascular disease. • This includes heart failure, a heart defect, a heart infection or a heart rhythm condition. • Carotid artery disease. • In this condition, the blood vessels in the neck that lead to the brain become clogged. • Peripheral artery disease (PAD). • PAD causes the blood vessels that carry blood to the arms and legs to become clogged. • Diabetes. • Diabetes speeds up and worsens the narrowing of arteries due to a buildup of fatty deposits, known as atherosclerosis. • High levels of homocysteine. • Elevated levels of this amino acid in the blood can cause the arteries to thicken and scar. • This makes them more susceptible to clots. • Excess weight. • Obesity, especially carrying extra weight in the stomach, increases stroke risk. • COVID-19. • There is evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 may raise the risk of stroke. • Cigarette smoking. • Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, raises blood pressure and plays a part in the development of atherosclerosis. • But quitting smoking lowers the risk of having a TIA or a stroke. • Physical inactivity. • Engaging in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days helps lower risk. • Poor nutrition. • Eating less fat and salt decreases the risk of a TIA and a stroke. • Heavy drinking. • If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Use of illicit drugs. • Avoid cocaine and other illicit drugs. • Knowing your risk factors and living healthfully are the best things you can do to prevent a transient ischemic attack. • A healthy lifestyle includes getting regular medical checkups. • Also: Don't smoke. • Stopping smoking reduces your risk of a TIA or a stroke. • Limit cholesterol and fat. • Cutting back on cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fat, in your diet may reduce buildup of plaques in the arteries. • Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. • These foods contain nutrients such as potassium, folate and antioxidants, which may protect against a TIA or a stroke. • Limit sodium. • If you have high blood pressure, avoid salty foods and don't add salt to food. • These habits may help reduce your blood pressure. • Limiting salt may not prevent high blood pressure, but excess sodium may increase blood pressure in some people. • Exercise regularly. • If you have high blood pressure, regular exercise is one of the few ways you can lower your blood pressure without medicines. • Limit alcohol intake. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • The recommended limit is no more than one drink daily for women and two drinks a day for men. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight contributes to other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. • Losing weight with diet and exercise may lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels. • Don't use illicit drugs. • Illicit drugs such as cocaine are associated with an increased risk of a TIA or a stroke. • Control diabetes. • You can manage diabetes and high blood pressure with diet, exercise, weight control and, when necessary, medicine.",

      "Risk factors": "Some risk factors of a transient ischemic attack and stroke can't be changed. • Others you can control. • You can't change these risk factors of a TIA and stroke. • But knowing you have these risks can motivate you to change the risk factors you can control. • Family history. • Your risk may be greater if one of your family members has had a TIA or a stroke. • Age. • Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 55. • Sex. • Men have a slightly higher risk of a TIA and a stroke. • But as women age, their risk of a stroke goes up. • Prior transient ischemic attack. • If you've had one or more TIAs, you're much more likely to have a stroke. • Sickle cell disease. • Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, also known as sickle cell anemia. • Sickle-shaped blood cells carry less oxygen and also tend to get stuck in artery walls, affecting blood flow to the brain. • But with proper treatment of sickle cell disease, you can lower your risk of a stroke. • You can control or treat a number of risk factors of a TIA and a stroke, including certain health conditions and lifestyle choices. • Having one or more of these risk factors doesn't mean you'll have a stroke, but your risk increases if you have two or more of them. • High blood pressure. • The risk of a stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings of 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and higher. • Your healthcare professional can help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age and other factors, such as whether you have diabetes. • High cholesterol. • Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fat, may reduce the plaques in your arteries. • If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, your provider may prescribe a statin or another type of cholesterol-lowering medicine. • Cardiovascular disease. • This includes heart failure, a heart defect, a heart infection or a heart rhythm condition. • Carotid artery disease. • In this condition, the blood vessels in the neck that lead to the brain become clogged. • Peripheral artery disease (PAD). • PAD causes the blood vessels that carry blood to the arms and legs to become clogged. • Diabetes. • Diabetes speeds up and worsens the narrowing of arteries due to a buildup of fatty deposits, known as atherosclerosis. • High levels of homocysteine. • Elevated levels of this amino acid in the blood can cause the arteries to thicken and scar. • This makes them more susceptible to clots. • Excess weight. • Obesity, especially carrying extra weight in the stomach, increases stroke risk. • COVID-19. • There is evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 may raise the risk of stroke. • Cigarette smoking. • Smoking increases the risk of blood clots, raises blood pressure and plays a part in the development of atherosclerosis. • But quitting smoking lowers the risk of having a TIA or a stroke. • Physical inactivity. • Engaging in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days helps lower risk. • Poor nutrition. • Eating less fat and salt decreases the risk of a TIA and a stroke. • Heavy drinking. • If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Use of illicit drugs. • Avoid cocaine and other illicit drugs.",
      "Prevention": "Knowing your risk factors and living healthfully are the best things you can do to prevent a transient ischemic attack. • A healthy lifestyle includes getting regular medical checkups. • Also: Don't smoke. • Stopping smoking reduces your risk of a TIA or a stroke. • Limit cholesterol and fat. • Cutting back on cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fat, in your diet may reduce buildup of plaques in the arteries. • Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. • These foods contain nutrients such as potassium, folate and antioxidants, which may protect against a TIA or a stroke. • Limit sodium. • If you have high blood pressure, avoid salty foods and don't add salt to food. • These habits may help reduce your blood pressure. • Limiting salt may not prevent high blood pressure, but excess sodium may increase blood pressure in some people. • Exercise regularly. • If you have high blood pressure, regular exercise is one of the few ways you can lower your blood pressure without medicines. • Limit alcohol intake. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • The recommended limit is no more than one drink daily for women and two drinks a day for men. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Being overweight contributes to other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. • Losing weight with diet and exercise may lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels. • Don't use illicit drugs. • Illicit drugs such as cocaine are associated with an increased risk of a TIA or a stroke. • Control diabetes. • You can manage diabetes and high blood pressure with diet, exercise, weight control and, when necessary, medicine."

      "Overview": "Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a serious, rare heart problem in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed. • The condition is present at birth, which means it's a congenital heart defect. • There are two types of transposition of the great arteries: Complete transposition of the great arteries, also called dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA). • This type reduces the amount of oxygen-rich blood to the body. • Symptoms are usually noticed during pregnancy, immediately after birth or within a few weeks of birth. • Without treatment, serious complications or death can occur. • Congenitally corrected transposition, also called levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA). • This is a less common type. • Symptoms may not be noticed right away. • Treatment depends on the specific heart problems. • Surgery to correct the positions of the arteries is the usual treatment. • The surgery is usually done soon after birth.",
      "Symptoms": "Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) may be seen in a baby before birth during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. • But some people with the congenitally corrected type of TGA may not have symptoms for many years. • Symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include: Blue or gray skin. • Depending on the baby's skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. • Weak pulse. • Lack of appetite. • Poor weight gain. • Skin color changes may not be noticed right away if a baby with TGA also has other heart problems. • This is because the other heart problems may let some oxygen-rich blood move through the body. • But as the baby becomes more active, less blood flows through the body. • The blue or gray skin color then becomes more noticeable. • Always seek emergency medical help if you notice that anyone develops a blue or gray skin color.",
      "Causes": "Transposition of the great arteries occurs during pregnancy when the baby's heart is developing. • The cause is most often unknown. • To understand transposition of the great arteries, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically pumps blood. • Usually, the artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs — called the pulmonary artery — connects to the heart's lower right chamber. • That chamber is called the right ventricle. • Oxygen-rich blood is then pumped from the lungs to the heart's upper left chamber, also called the left atrium. • Blood then flows into the lower left chamber, known as the left ventricle. • The body's main artery, called the aorta, typically connects to the left ventricle. • It carries oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. • In a complete transposition of the great arteries (also called dextro-transposition of the great arteries), the two arteries leaving the heart have switched positions. • The pulmonary artery connects to the left lower heart chamber. • The aorta connects to the right lower heart chamber. • The switched arteries cause changes in blood flow. • Oxygen-poor blood now flows through the right side of the heart. • It goes back to the body without passing through the lungs. • Oxygen-rich blood now flows through the left side of the heart. • It goes directly back into the lungs without being pumped to the rest of the body. • In this less common type, also called levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA), the two lower heart chambers are reversed. • The lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle, is on the heart's right side. • It gets blood from the upper right heart chamber. • The lower right heart chamber is on the heart's left side. • It gets blood from the left upper heart chamber. • The blood usually still flows correctly through the heart and body. • But the heart can have long-term trouble pumping blood. • People with L-TGA may also have problems with the tricuspid heart valve.",
      "Risk factors": "Several things may increase a baby's risk of transposition of the great arteries, including: A history of German measles (rubella) or another infection by a virus during pregnancy. • Drinking alcohol or taking certain medicines during pregnancy. • Smoking during pregnancy. • Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy.",
      "Complications": "Complications depend on the type of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). • Possible complications of complete transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) may include: Not enough oxygen to body tissues. • Unless there's some mixing of oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood within the body, this complication causes death. • Heart failure. • Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. • It may develop over time because the right lower heart chamber is pumping under higher pressure than usual. • The strain may make the muscle of the right lower chamber stiff or weak. • Possible complications of congenitally corrected transposition (L-TGA) may include: Reduced heart pumping. • In L-TGA, the right lower heart chamber pumps blood to the body. • This work is different from what that chamber was designed to do. • This can cause changes in how well the heart pumps blood. • Complete heart block. • The changes in the structure of the heart due to L-TGA can change the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat. • A complete heart block occurs if all signals are blocked. • Heart valve disease. • In L-TGA, the valve between the upper and lower heart chambers — the tricuspid valve — may not close completely. • Blood might move backward through the valve. • This condition is called tricuspid valve regurgitation. • It can eventually reduce the heart's ability to pump blood. • If you had transposition of the great arteries and want to become pregnant, talk with a health care provider first. • It may be possible to have a healthy pregnancy, but special care may be needed. • Complications of TGA, such as changes in heart signaling or serious heart muscle problems, may make pregnancy risky. • Pregnancy isn't recommended for people who have severe complications of TGA, even if they had surgery to fix the TGA.",
      "Prevention": "If you have a family history of heart problems present at birth, consider talking with a genetic counselor and a health care provider experienced in congenital heart defects before getting pregnant. • It's important to take steps to have a healthy pregnancy. • Before becoming pregnant, get recommended immunizations and start taking a multivitamin with 400 micrograms of folic acid."

      "Overview": "Traveler's diarrhea is a digestive tract disorder that commonly causes loose stools and stomach cramps. • It's caused by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. • Fortunately, traveler's diarrhea usually isn't serious in most people — it's just unpleasant. • When you visit a place where the climate or sanitary practices are different from yours at home, you have an increased risk of developing traveler's diarrhea. • To reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea, be careful about what you eat and drink while traveling. • If you do develop traveler's diarrhea, chances are it will go away without treatment. • However, it's a good idea to have doctor-approved medicines with you when you travel to high-risk areas. • This way, you'll be prepared in case diarrhea gets severe or won't go away.",
      "Symptoms": "Traveler's diarrhea may begin suddenly during your trip or shortly after you return home. • Most people improve within 1 to 2 days without treatment and recover completely within a week. • However, you can have multiple episodes of traveler's diarrhea during one trip. • The most common symptoms of traveler's diarrhea are: Suddenly passing three or more looser watery stools a day. • An urgent need to pass stool. • Stomach cramps. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Fever. • Sometimes, people experience moderate to severe dehydration, ongoing vomiting, a high fever, bloody stools, or severe pain in the belly or rectum. • If you or your child experiences any of these symptoms or if the diarrhea lasts longer than a few days, it's time to see a healthcare professional. • Traveler's diarrhea usually goes away on its own within several days. • Symptoms may last longer and be more severe if it's caused by certain bacteria or parasites. • In such cases, you may need prescription medicines to help you get better. • If you're an adult, see your doctor if: Your diarrhea lasts beyond two days. • You become dehydrated. • You have severe stomach or rectal pain. • You have bloody or black stools. • You have a fever above 102 F (39 C). • While traveling internationally, a local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language. • Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time. • Call a doctor if your child is sick and has any of the following symptoms: Ongoing vomiting. • A fever of 102 F (39 C) or more. • Bloody stools or severe diarrhea. • Dry mouth or crying without tears. • Signs of being unusually sleepy, drowsy or unresponsive. • Decreased volume of urine, including fewer wet diapers in infants.",
      "Causes": "It's possible that traveler's diarrhea may stem from the stress of traveling or a change in diet. • But usually infectious agents — such as bacteria, viruses or parasites — are to blame. • You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water contaminated with organisms from feces. • So why aren't natives of high-risk countries affected in the same way? Often their bodies have become used to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them.",
      "Risk factors": "Each year millions of international travelers experience traveler's diarrhea. • High-risk destinations for traveler's diarrhea include areas of: Central America. • South America. • Mexico. • Africa. • South Asia and Southeast Asia. • Traveling to Eastern Europe, South Africa, Central and East Asia, the Middle East, and a few Caribbean islands also poses some risk. • However, your risk of traveler's diarrhea is generally low in Northern and Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. • Your chances of getting traveler's diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination. • But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition. • These include: Young adults. • The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists. • Though the reasons why aren't clear, it's possible that young adults lack acquired immunity. • They may also be more adventurous than older people in their travels and dietary choices, or they may be less careful about avoiding contaminated foods. • People with weakened immune systems. • A weakened immune system due to an underlying illness or immune-suppressing medicines such as corticosteroids increases risk of infections. • People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, or severe kidney, liver or heart disease. • These conditions can leave you more prone to infection or increase your risk of a more-severe infection. • People who take acid blockers or antacids. • Acid in the stomach tends to destroy organisms, so a reduction in stomach acid may leave more opportunity for bacterial survival. • People who travel during certain seasons. • The risk of traveler's diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world. • For example, risk is highest in South Asia during the hot months just before the monsoons.",
      "Complications": "Because you lose vital fluids, salts and minerals during a bout with traveler's diarrhea, you may become dehydrated, especially during the summer months. • Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. • Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma. • Symptoms of dehydration include a very dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, dizziness, or extreme weakness.",
      "Prevention": "The general rule of thumb when traveling to another country is this: Boil it, cook it, peel it or forget it. • But it's still possible to get sick even if you follow these rules. • Other tips that may help decrease your risk of getting sick include: Don't consume food from street vendors. • Don't consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products, including ice cream. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meat, fish and shellfish. • Don't eat moist food at room temperature, such as sauces and buffet offerings. • Eat foods that are well cooked and served hot. • Stick to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself, such as bananas, oranges and avocados. • Stay away from salads and from fruits you can't peel, such as grapes and berries. • Be aware that alcohol in a drink won't keep you safe from contaminated water or ice. • When visiting high-risk areas, keep the following tips in mind: Don't drink unsterilized water — from tap, well or stream. • If you need to consume local water, boil it for three minutes. • Let the water cool naturally and store it in a clean covered container. • Don't use locally made ice cubes or drink mixed fruit juices made with tap water. • Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in contaminated water. • Use bottled or boiled water to mix baby formula. • Order hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, and make sure they're steaming hot. • Feel free to drink canned or bottled drinks in their original containers — including water, carbonated beverages, beer or wine — as long as you break the seals on the containers yourself. • Wipe off any can or bottle before drinking or pouring. • Use bottled water to brush your teeth. • Don't swim in water that may be contaminated. • Keep your mouth closed while showering. • If it's not possible to buy bottled water or boil your water, bring some means to purify water. • Consider a water-filter pump with a microstrainer filter that can filter out small microorganisms. • You also can chemically disinfect water with iodine or chlorine. • Iodine tends to be more effective, but is best reserved for short trips, as too much iodine can be harmful to your system. • You can purchase water-disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, iodine tablets or crystals, or other disinfecting agents at camping stores and pharmacies. • Be sure to follow the directions on the package. • Here are other ways to reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea: Make sure dishes and utensils are clean and dry before using them. • Wash your hands often and always before eating. • If washing isn't possible, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands before eating. • Seek out food items that require little handling in preparation. • Keep children from putting things — including their dirty hands — in their mouths. • If possible, keep infants from crawling on dirty floors. • Tie a colored ribbon around the bathroom faucet to remind you not to drink — or brush your teeth with — tap water. • Public health experts generally don't recommend taking antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, because doing so can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. • Antibiotics provide no protection against viruses and parasites, but they can give travelers a false sense of security about the risks of consuming local foods and beverages. • They also can cause unpleasant side effects, such as skin rashes, skin reactions to the sun and vaginal yeast infections. • As a preventive measure, some doctors suggest taking bismuth subsalicylate, which has been shown to decrease the likelihood of diarrhea. • However, don't take this medicine for longer than three weeks, and don't take it at all if you're pregnant or allergic to aspirin. • Talk to your doctor before taking bismuth subsalicylate if you're taking certain medicines, such as anticoagulants. • Common harmless side effects of bismuth subsalicylate include a black-colored tongue and dark stools. • In some cases, it can cause constipation, nausea and, rarely, ringing in your ears, called tinnitus."

      "Overview": "Trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh), also called hair-pulling disorder, is a mental health condition. • It involves frequent, repeated and irresistible urges to pull out hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body. • You may try to resist the urges, but you can't stop. • Trichotillomania is part of a group of conditions known as body-focused repetitive behaviors. • Pulling out hair from the scalp often leaves patchy bald spots. • This can cause a lot of distress and can affect your work, school and social life. • You may go to great lengths to hide the hair loss. • For some people, trichotillomania may be mild and can be managed. • For others, the automatic or deliberate urge to pull out hair is too much to handle emotionally. • Some treatment options may help reduce hair pulling or stop it entirely.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of trichotillomania often include: Repeatedly pulling out your hair, whether it's automatic or on purpose, usually from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas. • The sites may vary over time. • An increasing sense of tension before pulling out your hair, or when you try to resist pulling. • A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled out. • Hair loss that's easy to see, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body. • This may include thin or missing eyelashes or eyebrows. • Pulling out specific types of hair, taking the same steps in the same way each time hair is pulled out or pulling out hair in certain patterns. • Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair. • Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face. • Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success. • Experiencing a great deal of distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair. • Often trichotillomania also includes picking your skin, biting your nails or chewing your lips. • Sometimes pulling out hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. • Pulling out hair is usually done in private. • An episode can last from a few seconds to hours. • You may try to hide your condition from others. • With trichotillomania, pulling out hair can be: Automatic. • You may pull out your hair without even realizing that you're doing it. • This might happen, for example, when you're bored, reading or watching TV. • Focused. • You may pull out your hair on purpose to relieve tension or distress. • You may develop specific rituals for pulling out hair, such as finding just the right hair. • You may play with, bite or eat pulled-out hairs. • You may do both automatic and focused hair pulling, depending on the situation and your mood. • Certain positions or activities may trigger pulling out hair, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair. • Trichotillomania can be related to emotions, including: Negative feelings. • Pulling out hair may be a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, extreme tiredness or frustration. • Positive feelings. • You may find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides some relief. • As a result, you may continue to pull out your hair to keep these positive feelings. • Trichotillomania is a long-term disorder. • If not treated, symptoms may come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. • Also, symptoms can vary in severity over time. • For example, hormone changes during the menstrual period can worsen symptoms in some females. • Rarely, pulling out hair ends within a few years of starting. • If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result, talk to your health care provider. • Trichotillomania is not just a bad habit, it's a mental health condition. • It's not likely to get better without treatment.",
      "Causes": "The cause of trichotillomania is not clear. • But like many complex disorders, trichotillomania likely results from a combination of genetic and learned factors.",
      "Risk factors": "These factors tend to increase the risk of trichotillomania: Family history. • Genetics may play a role in the development of trichotillomania. • You may be more likely to have the condition if you have a close relative with trichotillomania. • Health conditions. • Some people may have hair or skin conditions that feel uncomfortable. • This may focus their attention toward pulling hair or picking at their scalp. • Age. • Trichotillomania usually develops just before or during the early teens — most often between the ages of 10 and 13 years. • It's often a lifelong problem. • Babies may pull out their hair, but this is usually mild and goes away on its own without treatment. • Other mental health conditions. • Other conditions, such as depression, anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may occur along with trichotillomania. • Stress. • Severely stressful situations or events may trigger trichotillomania in some people. • Environment. • Boredom, isolation and privacy often increase the likelihood of hair pulling. • Although far more women than men are treated for trichotillomania, this may be because women are more likely to seek medical advice. • In early childhood, trichotillomania occurs just as often in boys and girls.",
      "Complications": "Although it may not seem serious, trichotillomania can have harmful effects on your life. • Complications may include: Emotional distress. • You may feel frustrated, ashamed and embarrassed because of your condition and hair loss. • You may feel that you don't have control over pulling out your hair. • You may experience low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and problems with alcohol or drugs. • Problems in your social life and with work. • Hair loss may lead you to avoid social activities and school and job opportunities. • You may wear wigs, style your hair to disguise bald patches or wear false eyelashes. • You may avoid intimacy to hide your condition. • Skin and hair damage. • Constantly pulling out hair can cause scarring, infections and other damage to the skin on your scalp or the area where hair is pulled out. • This can permanently affect hair growth. • Hairballs. • Eating your hair may lead to a large, matted hairball that stays in your digestive tract. • Over a period of years, the hairball can cause weight loss, vomiting, an intestinal block and even death."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of tricuspid valve disease depend on the specific valve condition and how severe it is. • Tricuspid stenosis symptoms are often mild. • Symptoms may include: A fast, pounding heartbeat. • Fluttering feeling in the neck. • Fatigue. • People with tricuspid regurgitation may not have symptoms. • But the condition may cause vague symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and swelling in the legs or belly. • Sometimes there is a pulsing feeling in the neck veins. • Tricuspid atresia and Ebstein anomaly symptoms often are seen at birth. • They may include: Blue or gray skin and lips. • Depending on skin color, these changes may be easier or harder to see. • Difficulty breathing. • Slow growth and poor weight gain. • Tiring easily, especially during feedings. • Some types of tricuspid valve disease may cause symptoms of right-sided heart failure. • Right-sided heart failure symptoms include: Fatigue and weakness. • Shortness of breath. • Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. • Swelling of the belly area, a condition called ascites. • Sudden weight gain from a buildup of fluid. • If you have changes in your heartbeat or unexplained weakness or fatigue, make an appointment for a health checkup. • You may be sent to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.",
      "Causes": "Causes of tricuspid valve disease depend on the specific condition. • To understand the causes of heart valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. • Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. • These valves are: Aortic valve. • Mitral valve. • Pulmonary valve. • Tricuspid valve. • Each valve has flaps, called leaflets or cusps. • The flaps open and close once during each heartbeat. • If a valve flap doesn't open or close properly, less blood moves out of the heart to the rest of the body. • Some people are born with tricuspid valve disease. • In others, it happens later in life. • Some causes of tricuspid valve disease later in life are: Infection of the lining of the heart and heart valves, called infective endocarditis. • A complication of strep throat that's not treated, called rheumatic fever. • A connective tissue disorder called Marfan syndrome. • Carcinoid syndrome, caused by a rare tumor that releases certain chemicals. • Heart tumors or cancer that has spread to the right side of the heart. • Lupus and other autoimmune diseases. • Scarring from chest radiation or pacemaker placement. • An irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AFib). • High pressures in the lungs, called pulmonary hypertension.",

      "Symptoms": "Tricuspid valve regurgitation often doesn't cause symptoms until the condition is severe. • It may be found when medical tests are done for another reason. • Symptoms of tricuspid valve regurgitation may include: Extreme tiredness. • Shortness of breath with activity. • Feelings of a rapid or pounding heartbeat. • Pounding or pulsing feeling in the neck. • Swelling in the belly, legs or neck veins. • Make an appointment for a health checkup if you get tired very easily or feel short of breath with activity. • You may need to see a doctor trained in heart conditions, called a cardiologist.",
      "Causes": "To understand the causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation, it may help to know how the heart and heart valves typically work. • A typical heart has four chambers. • The two upper chambers, called the atria, receive blood. • The two lower chambers, called the ventricles, pump blood. • Four valves open and close to keep blood flowing in the correct direction. • These heart valves are: Aortic valve. • Mitral valve. • Tricuspid valve. • Pulmonary valve. • The tricuspid valve is between the heart's two right chambers. • It has three thin flaps of tissue, called cusps or leaflets. • These flaps open to let blood move from the upper right chamber to the lower right chamber. • The valve flaps then close tightly so blood doesn't flow backward. • In tricuspid valve regurgitation, the tricuspid valve doesn't close tightly. • So, blood leaks backward into the upper right heart chamber. • Causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation include: A heart problem you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect. • Some congenital heart defects affect the shape of the tricuspid valve and how it works. • Tricuspid valve regurgitation in children is usually caused by a rare heart problem present at birth called Ebstein anomaly. • In this condition, the tricuspid valve does not form correctly. • It also is lower than usual in the lower right heart chamber. • Marfan syndrome. • This condition is caused by changes in genes. • It affects the fibers that support and anchor the organs and other structures in the body. • It's occasionally associated with tricuspid valve regurgitation. • Rheumatic fever. • This complication of strep throat can cause permanent damage to the heart and heart valves. • When that happens, it's called rheumatic heart valve disease. • Infection of the lining of the heart and heart valves, also called infective endocarditis. • This condition can damage the tricuspid valve. • IV drug misuse increases the risk of infective endocarditis. • Carcinoid syndrome. • This condition occurs when a rare cancerous tumor releases certain chemicals into the bloodstream. • It can lead to carcinoid heart disease, which damages heart valves, most commonly the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. • Chest injury. • An injury to the chest, such as from a car accident, may cause damage that leads to tricuspid valve regurgitation. • Pacemaker or other heart device wires. • Tricuspid valve regurgitation might happen if wires from a pacemaker or defibrillator cross the tricuspid valve. • Heart biopsy, also called an endomyocardial biopsy. • Heart valve damage can sometimes happen when a small amount of heart muscle tissue is removed for examination. • Radiation therapy. • Rarely, radiation therapy for cancer that is focused on the chest area can cause tricuspid valve regurgitation.",
      "Risk factors": "A risk factor is something that makes you more likely to get a sickness or other health condition. • Things that can increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation are: An irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Being born with a heart problem, called a congenital heart defect. • Damage to the heart muscle, including heart attack. • Heart failure. • High blood pressure in the lungs, also called pulmonary hypertension. • Infections of the heart and heart valves. • History of radiation therapy to the chest area. • Use of some weight-loss drugs and medicines to treat migraines and mental health disorders.",
      "Complications": "Tricuspid valve regurgitation complications may depend on how severe the condition is. • Possible complications of tricuspid regurgitation include: An irregular and often rapid heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Some people with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation also have this common heart rhythm disorder. • AFib has been linked to an increased risk of blood clots and stroke. • Heart failure. • In severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, the heart has to work harder to pump enough blood to the body. • The extra effort causes the lower right heart chamber to get bigger. • Untreated, the heart muscle becomes weak. • This can cause heart failure."

      "Overview": "Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. • It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. • Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. • Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. • It's known as a chronic pain condition. • People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain. • But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often. • It's more common in women and people older than 50. • But trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, doesn't mean living a life of pain. • It usually can be managed with treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns: Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock. • Sudden episodes of pain or pain triggered by touching the face, chewing, speaking or brushing your teeth. • Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. • Pain that occurs with facial spasms. • Episodes of pain lasting days, weeks, months or longer. • Some people have periods when they experience no pain. • Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. • These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips. • Less often, the eye and forehead may be affected. • Pain on one side of the face at a time. • Pain focused in one spot. • Or the pain may be spread in a wider pattern. • Pain that rarely occurs while sleeping. • Episodes of pain that become more frequent and intense over time. • See your healthcare professional if you experience pain in your face, particularly if it's long-lasting or comes back after going away. • Also get medical attention if you have chronic pain that doesn't go away with pain medicine that you buy off the shelf. • In trigeminal neuralgia, the trigeminal nerve's function is disrupted. • Contact between a blood vessel and the trigeminal nerve at the base of the brain often causes the pain. • The blood vessel may be an artery or a vein. • This contact puts pressure on the nerve and doesn't allow it to function as usual. • But while compression by a blood vessel is a common cause, there are many other potential causes. • Multiple sclerosis or a similar condition that damages the myelin sheath protecting certain nerves can cause trigeminal neuralgia. • A tumor pressing against the trigeminal nerve also can cause the condition. • Some people may experience trigeminal neuralgia as a result of a stroke or facial trauma. • An injury of the nerve due to surgery also can cause trigeminal neuralgia. • Several triggers may set off the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, including: Shaving. • Touching your face. • Eating. • Drinking. • Brushing your teeth. • Talking. • Putting on makeup. • A light breeze blowing over your face. • Smiling. • Washing your face. • Research has found that some factors put people at higher risk of trigeminal neuralgia, including: Sex. • Women are more likely than men to experience trigeminal neuralgia. • Age. • Trigeminal neuralgia is more common among people 50 and older. • Certain conditions. • For example, hypertension is a risk factor for trigeminal neuralgia. • In addition, people with multiple sclerosis are at higher risk of trigeminal neuralgia.",

      "Overview": "Truncus arteriosus (TRUNG-kus ahr-teer-e-O-sus) is a rare heart condition present at birth. • That means it's a congenital heart defect. • In this condition, one large blood vessel leads out of the heart, instead of two. • Having only one large blood vessel means that oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood mix. • This mixing reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the body. • It usually increases the amount of blood flow into the lungs too. • The heart has to work harder to adjust for the changes in blood flow. • A baby, also called a fetus, with truncus arteriosus also usually has a hole between the two lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • The hole is called a ventricular septal defect. • Another name for truncus arteriosus is common arterial trunk.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of truncus arteriosus most often occur in the first few days of life. • They include: Blue or gray skin due to low oxygen levels. • Extreme sleepiness. • Poor feeding. • Poor growth. • Pounding heartbeat. • Fast breathing. • Shortness of breath. • If you are worried about your baby's feedings, sleep patterns or growth, contact a healthcare professional for an appointment. • Always seek emergency medical care if a baby has any of the following: Blue or gray skin. • Fast breathing. • Shallow breathing. • Any breathing trouble.",
      "Causes": "Truncus arteriosus occurs as a baby's heart forms during pregnancy. • There's often no clear cause. • Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. • To understand more about truncus arteriosus, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works. • The typical heart has four chambers. • They are: The right upper chamber, also called the right atrium. • This heart chamber receives oxygen-poor blood from the body. • The right lower chamber, also called the right ventricle. • This heart chamber pumps blood into the lungs through a large vessel called the pulmonary artery. • The blood flows through the pulmonary artery into smaller vessels in the lungs where blood picks up oxygen. • The left upper chamber, also called the left atrium. • This heart chamber receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through vessels called pulmonary veins. • The left lower chamber, also called the left ventricle. • This chamber pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the body through the body's largest blood vessel, called the aorta. • The way the unborn baby's heart forms during pregnancy is complex. • At some point, there is a single large blood vessel leading out of the heart. • The vessel is called the truncus arteriosus. • It usually splits in two as the unborn baby grows in the womb. • One part becomes the lower end of the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The other part becomes the lower part of the pulmonary artery. • But in some babies, the truncus arteriosus never splits. • The wall separating the two lower heart chambers hasn't closed all the way. • This results in a large hole between those chambers, called a ventricular septal defect. • Babies with truncus arteriosus also often have a problem with the heart valve that controls blood flow from the lower heart chambers to the single vessel. • This valve may not close all the way when the heart relaxes. • Blood can move the wrong way, back into the heart. • This is called truncal valve regurgitation.",
      "Risk factors": "The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is unknown. • But some things might increase the risk of a heart problem at birth. • Risk factors include: Viral illness during pregnancy. • Some infections can hurt a developing baby. • For example, having German measles during pregnancy can cause changes in a baby's heart development. • German measles also is called rubella. • Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy. • Careful control of your blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of heart problems in your baby. • If you have diabetes, work with your healthcare professional to be sure blood sugar is well controlled before getting pregnant. • Some medicines taken during pregnancy. • Some medicines can cause heart problems and other health conditions in a baby. • Tell your healthcare professional about all the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. • Some chromosomal disorders. • An extra or irregular chromosome increases the risk of truncus arteriosus. • Examples are DiGeorge syndrome, also called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and velocardiofacial syndrome. • Smoking during pregnancy. • If you smoke, quit. • Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of heart conditions in your baby. • Alcohol use. • Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of heart conditions and other health issues in a baby. • Obesity. • Obesity increases the risk of giving birth to a baby with a heart",
      "Complications": "Truncus arteriosus causes severe problems with how blood flows through the lungs, heart and rest of the body. • Complications of truncus arteriosus in babies include: Breathing problems. • Extra fluid and blood in the lungs can make it difficult to breathe. • High blood pressure in the lungs, also called pulmonary hypertension. • This condition causes the blood vessels in the lungs to narrow. • It becomes hard for the heart to pump blood into the lungs. • Enlargement of the heart. • Pulmonary hypertension and increased blood flow strain the heart. • The heart must work harder to pump blood. • This causes the heart muscle to grow larger. • The enlarged heart gradually weakens. • Heart failure. • In this condition, the heart cannot supply the body with enough blood. • Too little oxygen and too much strain on the heart can lead to heart failure. • Infants who had their hearts successfully fixed with surgery may still have complications later in life. • Possible complications are: Pulmonary hypertension that gets worse. • Backward flow of blood through a heart valve, called regurgitation. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Common symptoms of these complications include: Dizziness. • Feeling very fast, fluttering heartbeats. • Feeling very tired. • Shortness of breath when exercising. • Swelling of the belly, legs or feet. • In rare cases, some people born with truncus arteriosus can survive without heart surgery. • They may live into adulthood. • But those with the condition will almost certainly have heart failure and develop a complication called Eisenmenger syndrome. • This syndrome is caused by permanent lung vessel damage. • It results in a significant lack of blood flow to the lungs.",
      "Prevention": "Because the cause is unclear, it may not be possible to prevent truncus arteriosus. • Getting good prenatal care is important. • If you or someone in your family had a heart condition present at birth, talk to your healthcare professional before getting pregnant. • You might need to see a genetic counselor and a heart doctor, called a cardiologist. • If you decide to get pregnant, taking these steps can help keep your baby healthy: Get recommended vaccinations. • Some infections can be harmful to a developing baby. • For example, having German measles — also called rubella —during pregnancy can cause changes in a baby's heart development. • A blood test done before pregnancy can show if you're immune to rubella. • A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune. • Talk to your healthcare professional about your medicines. • Check with your healthcare professional before taking any medicines if you're pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. • Many drugs aren't recommended for use during pregnancy because they can harm a developing baby. • Take a folic acid supplement. • Take a multivitamin with folic acid. • Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce brain and spinal cord conditions in babies. • It may help reduce the risk of heart conditions present at birth too. • Control diabetes. • If you have diabetes, ask your healthcare professional how to best manage the disease during pregnancy."

      "Overview": "Tuberous sclerosis (TOO-bur-us skluh-ROH-sis), also called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), is an uncommon genetic disorder that causes tumors to develop in many parts of the body. • These tumors are not cancer. • Noncancerous tumors, also called benign tumors, are overgrowths of cells and tissue that are not expected. • Symptoms vary widely, depending on where the growths develop and how big they get. • Tuberous sclerosis is often first found during infancy or childhood. • Sometimes tuberous sclerosis can have such mild symptoms that the condition isn't diagnosed until adulthood, or it's not diagnosed at all. • Sometimes tuberous sclerosis causes serious disabilities. • There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, and the course of the disorder and how bad it gets can't be predicted. • But treatments are available to manage symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs. • But any part of the body can be affected. • Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths. • Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include: Skin changes. • Skin changes are most common. • These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. • On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. • Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. • Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common. • Seizures. • Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. • A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. • In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head. • Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. • Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. • Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. • Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. • Behavior problems. • Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. • Kidney problems. • Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age. • Heart issues. • Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older. • Lung problems. • Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. • These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males. • Eye problems. • Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. • These growths usually don't interfere with vision. • Dental changes. • Teeth may have pits in the surface. • Small growths may appear on the gums, inside of the cheeks and on the tongue. • Symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. • Or the first symptoms may appear during childhood or even years later in adulthood. • Contact your child's health care provider if you're concerned about your child's development or you notice any symptoms of tuberous sclerosis.",
      "Causes": "Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder caused by gene changes — sometimes called mutations — in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene. • These genes are thought to prevent cells from growing too fast or in an out-of-control way. • Changes in either of these genes can cause cells to grow and divide more than needed. • This leads to multiple growths throughout the body. • These growths are considered noncancerous tumors.",
      "Risk factors": "Tuberous sclerosis can be the result of either: A random cell division error. • About two-thirds of people who have tuberous sclerosis have a new change in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene linked with tuberous sclerosis. • Most people do not have a family history of tuberous sclerosis. • A gene change passed down in families. • About one-third of people who have tuberous sclerosis get a changed TSC1 or TSC2 gene from a parent who has the disorder. • If you have tuberous sclerosis, you have up to a 50% chance of passing the changed gene and the disorder to your biological children, which means children related to you by blood may inherit that gene. • How bad the disorder gets may vary. • A parent with tuberous sclerosis may have a child who has a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.",
      "Complications": "Depending on where the noncancerous tumors grow and their size, they can cause severe or life-threatening complications. • Here are some examples: Too much fluid in and around the brain. • One type of noncancerous brain growth, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, can grow along the lining of the fluid-filled spaces in the brain, called ventricles. • The tumor can block the flow of fluid that helps protect the brain, causing fluid to build up around the brain. • This buildup is called hydrocephalus. • Symptoms can include a head size that is larger than expected, nausea, headaches and behavior changes. • Heart complications. • Growths in the heart, usually in infants, can block blood flow or cause problems with heart rhythm. • Kidney damage. • Growths in the kidney can be large and cause potentially serious — even life-threatening — kidney problems. • Growths in the kidney can cause high blood pressure or bleeding or lead to kidney failure. • Rarely, kidney growths can become cancerous. • Lung failure. • Growths in the lungs damage the lung tissue and can lead to collapsed lungs. • The growths interfere with how well the lungs can provide oxygen to the rest of the body. • Increased risk of cancerous tumors. • Tuberous sclerosis is linked with an increased risk of developing cancerous tumors in the kidneys and brain. • Vision damage. • Growths in the eye can interfere with vision if they block too much of the retina, though this is rare."

      "Overview": "Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition. • In this condition, the pancreas makes little or no insulin. • Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. • Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. • Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults. • Even after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. • Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Type 1 diabetes symptoms can appear suddenly and may include: Feeling more thirsty than usual Urinating a lot Bed-wetting in children who have never wet the bed during the night Feeling very hungry Losing weight without trying Feeling irritable or having other mood changes Feeling tired and weak Having blurry vision Talk to your health care provider if you notice any of the above symptoms in you or your child.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. • Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — destroys the insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas. • Other possible causes include: Genetics Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors Once a large number of islet cells are destroyed, the body will produce little or no insulin. • Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas). • The pancreas puts insulin into the bloodstream. • Insulin travels through the body, allowing sugar to enter the cells. • Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. • As the blood sugar level drops, the pancreas puts less insulin into the bloodstream. • Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. • Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver. • Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. • The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen. • When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose. • This keeps glucose levels within a typical range. • In type 1 diabetes, there's no insulin to let glucose into the cells. • Because of this, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. • This can cause life-threatening complications.",
      "Risk factors": "Some factors that can raise your risk for type 1 diabetes include: Family history. • Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly higher risk of developing the condition. • Genetics. • Having certain genes increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. • Geography. • The number of people who have type 1 diabetes tends to be higher as you travel away from the equator. • Age. • Type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, but it appears at two noticeable peaks. • The first peak occurs in children between 4 and 7 years old. • The second is in children between 10 and 14 years old.",
      "Complications": "Over time, type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs in the body. • These organs include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. • Having a normal blood sugar level can lower the risk of many complications. • Diabetes complications can lead to disabilities or even threaten your life. • Heart and blood vessel disease. • Diabetes increases the risk of some problems with the heart and blood vessels. • These include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure. • Nerve damage (neuropathy). • Too much sugar in the blood can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that feed the nerves. • This is especially true in the legs. • This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain. • This usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and spreads upward. • Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs over time. • Damage to the nerves that affect the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. • For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. • Kidney damage (nephropathy). • The kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessels that keep waste from entering the blood. • Diabetes can damage this system. • Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. • End-stage kidney disease needs to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. • Eye damage. • Diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina (part of the eye that senses light) (diabetic retinopathy). • This could cause blindness. • Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. • Foot damage. • Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of some foot complications. • Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections. • These infections may need to be treated with toe, foot or leg removal (amputation). • Skin and mouth conditions. • Diabetes may leave you more prone to infections of the skin and mouth. • These include bacterial and fungal infections. • Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely. • Pregnancy complications. • High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the parent and the baby. • The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled. • For the parent, diabetes increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic eye problems (retinopathy), pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and preeclampsia.",
      "Prevention": "There's no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. • But researchers are working on preventing the disease or further damage of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed. • Ask your provider if you might be eligible for one of these clinical trials. • It is important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment available in a trial."

      "Overview": "Type 1 diabetes in children is a condition in which your child's body no longer produces an important hormone (insulin). • Your child needs insulin to survive, so the missing insulin needs to be replaced with injections or with an insulin pump. • Type 1 diabetes in children used to be known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes. • The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. • Suddenly you and your child — depending on your child's age — must learn how to give injections, count carbohydrates and monitor blood sugar. • There's no cure for type 1 diabetes in children, but it can be managed. • Advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved blood sugar management and quality of life for children with type 1 diabetes.",
      "Symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children usually develop quickly, and may include: Increased thirst Frequent urination, possibly bed-wetting in a toilet-trained child Extreme hunger Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Irritability or behavior changes Fruity-smelling breath See your child's health care provider if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 1 diabetes. • The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. • But in most people with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — mistakenly destroys insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas. • Genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role in this process. • Once the islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed, your child produces little or no insulin. • Insulin performs the critical job of moving sugar (glucose) from the bloodstream to the body's cells for energy. • Sugar enters the bloodstream when food is digested. • Without enough insulin, sugar builds up in your child's bloodstream. • This can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated. • Type 1 diabetes most often occurs in children but can occur at any age. • Risk factors for type 1 diabetes in children include: Family history. • Anyone with a parent or siblings with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition. • Genetics. • Certain genes indicate an increased risk of type 1 diabetes. • Race. • In the United States, type 1 diabetes is more common among white children of non-Hispanic descent than among children of other races. • Certain viruses. • Exposure to various viruses may trigger the autoimmune destruction of the islet cells. • Type 1 diabetes can affect the major organs in your body. • Keeping your blood sugar level close to normal most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications. • Complications can include: Heart and blood vessel disease. • Diabetes increases your child's risk of developing conditions such as narrowed blood vessels, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke later in life. • Nerve damage. • Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your child's nerves. • This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain. • Nerve damage usually happens gradually over a long period of time. • Kidney damage. • Diabetes can damage the numerous tiny blood vessel clusters in the kidneys that filter waste from your child's blood. • Eye damage. • Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye's retina, which may lead to vision problems. • Osteoporosis. • Diabetes may decrease bone mineral density, increasing your child's risk of osteoporosis as an adult. • You can help your child prevent diabetes complications by: Working with your child to maintain good blood sugar control as much as possible Teaching your child the importance of eating a healthy diet and participating in regular physical activity Scheduling regular visits with your child's diabetes health care professional Children with type 1 diabetes are at risk of other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid disease and celiac disease. • Your child's health care provider may recommend tests for these conditions. • There's currently no sure way to prevent type 1 diabetes, but this is a very active area of research. • The antibodies associated with type 1 diabetes in children who have a high risk of the disorder can be detected months or even years before the first symptoms of type 1 diabetes appear. • Researchers are working on: Preventing or delaying the start of type 1 diabetes in people who have a high risk of the disease. • Preventing further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed.",

      "Overview": "Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. • It was once called adult-onset diabetes. • Over time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. • This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. • It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar. • Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. • Type 2 is more common in older adults. • But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes. • There's no cure for type 2 diabetes. • Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. • If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often come on slowly. • In fact, people can live with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. • When there are symptoms, they may include: More thirst. • More urination. • More hunger. • Weight loss. • Tiredness. • Blurred vision. • Slow-healing sores. • Frequent infections. • Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. • Areas of darkened skin, most often in the armpits and neck. • See your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of type 2 diabetes. • Type 2 diabetes is mainly the result of two issues: Cells in muscle, fat and the liver don't respond to insulin as they should. • As a result, the cells don't take in enough sugar. • The gland that makes insulin, called the pancreas, can't make enough to keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range. • Being overweight and not moving enough are key factors. • Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland that sits behind and below the stomach. • The gland is called the pancreas. • Insulin manages how the body uses sugar in the following ways: Sugar in the bloodstream causes the pancreas to release insulin. • Insulin in the bloodstream gets sugar into the cells. • The amount of sugar in the bloodstream drops. • Then the pancreas releases less insulin. • A sugar called glucose is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. • Glucose comes from two major sources. • They are food and the liver. • Glucose goes into the bloodstream. • There it enters cells with the help of insulin. • The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen and also makes glucose. • When glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. • This keeps the body's glucose level within a healthy range. • In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. • Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. • As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. • Over time, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are damaged. • Then the cells can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs. • Factors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include: Excess weight. • Being overweight or obese is a main risk. • Waist size. • Storing fat mainly in the belly rather than in the hips and thighs raises the risk. • The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in people assigned male at birth whose waists measure more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). • For people assigned female at birth, a waist measure of more than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) raises the risk. • Sitting. • The less active a person is, the higher the risk. • Physical activity helps manage weight, uses up glucose as energy and helps cells take in insulin. • Family history. • Having a parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes raises the risk. • Race and ethnicity. • It's not clear why, but people of certain races and ethnicities are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people are. • Races and ethnicities include Black people, Hispanic people, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Island people. • Blood lipid levels. • A higher risk is linked with low levels of high-density lipoprotein. • Also called HDL cholesterol, this is the \"good\" cholesterol. • Higher risk also is linked with high levels of a certain type of fat in the blood, called triglycerides. • Age. • The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up with age, mainly after age 35. • Prediabetes. • Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than the standard range, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. • If not treated, prediabetes often moves on to become type 2 diabetes. • Pregnancy-related risks. • The risk of getting type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant. • And it's higher in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms). • Polycystic ovary syndrome. • This condition results in irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. • It raises the risk of diabetes. • Type 2 diabetes affects many major organs. • These include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. • Also, factors that raise the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. • Managing diabetes and blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including: Heart and blood vessel disease. • Diabetes is linked with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowed blood vessels, called atherosclerosis. • Nerve damage in arms and legs. • This condition is called neuropathy. • High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves. • Neuropathy may cause tingling, numbness, burning, pain or loss of feeling. • It most often begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and slowly spreads upward. • Other nerve damage. • Damage to nerves of the heart can cause irregular heart rhythms. • Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. • Nerve damage also may cause erectile dysfunction. • Kidney disease. • Diabetes may lead to long-term kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. • End-stage kidney disease may need to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant. • Eye damage. • Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye conditions. • Conditions include cataracts and glaucoma. • Diabetes also may damage the blood vessels of the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. • This is called diabetic retinopathy. • This damage can lead to blindness. • Skin conditions. • Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems. • Skin problems may include bacterial and fungal infections. • Slow healing. • Cuts and blisters that aren't treated can become serious infections. • The infections may heal poorly. • Bad damage can result in the need to use surgery to remove a toe, foot or leg. • This surgery is called amputation. • Hearing impairment. • Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. • Sleep apnea. • Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people who have type 2 diabetes. • Obesity may be the main cause of both conditions. • Dementia. • Type 2 diabetes seems to raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause dementia. • Poorly managed blood sugar is linked to a faster loss of memory and other thinking skills. • Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. • If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow the condition or keep it from becoming diabetes. • A healthy lifestyle includes the following: Eat healthy foods. • Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. • Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Be active. • Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling, running or swimming. • Lose weight. • If you are overweight, losing some weight and keeping it off may slow prediabetes from becoming type 2 diabetes. • If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may lower the risk of diabetes. • Don't sit for long. • Sitting for long periods can raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. • Get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes. • People with prediabetes may take metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medicine, to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. • This is most often prescribed for older adults who are obese and who can't lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.",

      "Overview": "Type 2 diabetes in children is a chronic disease that affects the way your child's body processes sugar (glucose) for fuel. • Without treatment, the disorder causes sugar to build up in the bloodstream, which can lead to serious long-term consequences. • Type 2 diabetes occurs more commonly in adults. • In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes. • But the increasing number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. • There's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in your child. • Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. • If healthy eating and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Type 2 diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms. • Sometimes, the disorder is diagnosed during a routine check-up. • Some children might experience these signs and symptoms as a result of too much sugar in their bloodstreams: Increased thirst Frequent urination Increased hunger Fatigue Blurry vision Darkened areas of skin, most often around the neck or in the armpits and groin Unintended weight loss, although this is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes Frequent infections See your child's health care provider if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 2 diabetes. • Undiagnosed, the disease can cause serious damage. • Diabetes screening is recommended for children who have started puberty or are at least 10 years old, who are overweight or obese, and who have at least one other risk factor for type 2 diabetes.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown. • But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. • What is clear is that children with type 2 diabetes can't process sugar (glucose) properly. • Most of the sugar in the body comes from food. • When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream. • Insulin allows sugar to enter the cells — and lowers the amount of sugar in the blood. • Insulin is produced by a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. • The pancreas sends insulin to the blood when food is eaten. • When the blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood. • When your child has type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work as well. • As a result, instead of fueling cells, sugar builds up in your child's bloodstream. • This can happen because: The pancreas may not make enough insulin The cells become resistant to insulin and don't allow as much sugar in",
      "Risk factors": "Researchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors. • However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including: Weight. • Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes in children. • The more fatty tissue children have — especially inside and between the muscle and skin around the abdomen — the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin. • Inactivity. • The less active children are, the greater their risk of type 2 diabetes. • Diet. • Eating red meat and processed meat and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. • Family history. • Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease. • Race or ethnicity. • Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. • Age and sex. • Many children develop type 2 diabetes in their early teens, but it may occur at any age. • Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys. • Maternal gestational diabetes. • Children born to women who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. • Low birth weight or preterm birth. • Having a low birth weight is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. • Babies born prematurely — before 39 to 42 weeks' gestation —have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes. • Type 2 diabetes in children is often associated with metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovarian syndrome. • When certain conditions occur with obesity, they are associated with insulin resistance and can increase the risk of diabetes — and heart disease and stroke. • A combination of the following conditions is often called metabolic syndrome: High blood pressure Low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), the \"good\" cholesterol High triglycerides High blood sugar levels Large waist size Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects young females after puberty. • PCOS is caused by an imbalance of hormones, resulting in signs such as weight gain, irregular menstrual periods, and excess face and body hair. • People with PCOS often have problems with metabolism that can result in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",
      "Complications": "Type 2 diabetes can affect nearly every organ in your child's body, including the blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. • The long-term complications of type 2 diabetes develop gradually over many years. • Eventually, diabetes complications may be severe or even life-threatening. • Complications of type 2 diabetes are related to high blood sugar and include: High cholesterol Heart and blood vessel disease Stroke Nerve damage Kidney disease Eye disease, including blindness Keeping your child's blood sugar level close to the standard range most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of these complications. • You can help your child prevent diabetes complications by: Working with your child to maintain good blood sugar control as much as possible Teaching your child the importance of healthy eating and participating in regular physical activity Scheduling regular visits with your child's diabetes treatment team",
      "Prevention": "Healthy-lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children. • Encourage your child to: Eat healthy foods. • Offer your child foods low in fat and calories. • Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Strive for variety to prevent boredom. • Get more physical activity. • Encourage your child to become active. • Sign up your child for a sports team or dance lessons. • Better yet, make it a family affair. • The lifestyle choices that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children can do the same for adults."
