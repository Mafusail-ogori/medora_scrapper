      "Overview": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia (a-gam-uh-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh), also called XLA, is an immune system disorder that's passed through families, called inherited. • XLA makes it hard to fight infections. • People with XLA might get infections of the inner ear, sinuses, respiratory tract, bloodstream and internal organs. • XLA almost always affects males. • But females can carry the genes linked to the condition. • Most people with XLA are diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, after they've had repeated infections. • Some people aren't diagnosed until they're adults.",
      "Symptoms": "Most babies with XLA appear healthy for the first few months. • They're protected by the proteins called antibodies they got from their mothers before birth. • When these antibodies leave their systems, the babies begin to get repeat bacterial infections. • The infections can be life-threatening. • Infections might involve the ears, lungs, sinuses and skin. • Male infants born with XLA have: Very small tonsils. • Small or no lymph nodes.",
      "Causes": "X-linked agammaglobulinemia is caused by a change in a gene. • People with the condition can't produce proteins called antibodies that fight infection. • About 40% of people with the condition have a family member who has it.",
      "Complications": "People with XLA can live mostly typical lives. • They should try to take part in regular activities for their ages. • But repeat infections linked to XLA will likely need careful watching and treatment. • They can damage organs and be life-threatening. • Possible complications include: Long-lasting, called chronic, lung disease. • Increased risk of certain cancers. • Infectious arthritis. • Increased risk of central nervous system infections from live vaccines."
