      "Symptoms": "Yeast infection symptoms range from mild to moderate. • They may include: Itching and irritation in the vagina and tissues at the vaginal opening, called the vulva. • A burning feeling, mainly during intercourse or while urinating. • Redness and swelling of the vulva. • Redness may be harder to see on Black or brown skin than on white skin. • Vaginal pain and soreness. • Thick, white vaginal shedding of fluid and cells, called discharge, with little or no odor. • The discharge looks like cottage cheese. • You might have a complicated yeast infection if: You have severe symptoms, such as a lot of redness, swelling and itching that leads to tears, cracks or sores in the vagina. • You have four or more yeast infections in a year. • Your infection is caused by a less common type of fungus. • You're pregnant. • You have diabetes that isn't well-managed. • Your immune system is weakened because of certain medicines or conditions such as HIV infection. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if: This is the first time you've had symptoms of a yeast infection. • You're not sure whether you have a yeast infection. • Your symptoms don't go away after you treat them with antifungal vaginal creams or suppositories that you can get without a prescription. • You have other symptoms. • The fungus Candida albicans causes most vaginal yeast infections. • Most often, the vagina has a balance of yeast, including candida, and bacteria. • Certain bacteria called lactobacillus work to prevent too much yeast. • But some factors can affect the balance. • Too much candida or the fungus growing deeper into vaginal cells causes symptoms of a yeast infection. • Too much yeast can result from: Antibiotic use. • Pregnancy. • Diabetes that isn't well-managed. • A weakened immune system. • Use of birth control pills or hormone therapy that raises levels of the hormone estrogen. • Candida albicans is the most common type of fungus to cause yeast infections. • When other types of candida fungus cause yeast infections, they can be harder to treat. • Factors that raise the risk of getting a yeast infection include: Antibiotic use. • Yeast infections are common in people who take antibiotics. • Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a range of bacteria. • They also kill healthy bacteria in the vagina. • This can lead to too much yeast. • Raised estrogen levels. • Yeast infections are more common in people with higher estrogen levels. • Pregnancy, birth control pills and hormone therapy can raise estrogen levels. • Diabetes that isn't well-managed. • People with poorly managed blood sugar are at greater risk of yeast infections than are people with well-managed blood sugar. • Weakened immune system. • People with lowered immunity are more likely to get yeast infections. • Lower immunity might be from corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection or other diseases that suppress the immune system. • To lower your risk of vaginal yeast infections, wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly. • Also, these tips might help prevent a yeast infection: Do not wear tight pantyhose, underwear or jeans. • Do not douche. • This removes some of the good germs in the vagina that protect from infection. • Do not use scented products in the vaginal area. • For instance, don't use scented bubble bath, soap, menstrual pads and tampons. • Do not use hot tubs or take hot baths. • Do not use antibiotics you don't need. • For instance, don't take antibiotics for colds or other viral infections. • Do not stay in wet clothes, such as swimsuits and workout clothes, for longer than needed.",

      "Overview": "The yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt. • However, the yips also can affect people who play other sports — such as cricket, darts and baseball. • It was once thought that the yips were always associated with performance anxiety. • However, it now appears that some people have the yips due to a neurological condition affecting specific muscles. • This condition is known as focal dystonia. • Changing the way you perform the affected task might help you find relief from the yips. • For example, a right-handed golfer might try putting left-handed.",
      "Symptoms": "The most common symptom associated with the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasms or freezing.",
      "Causes": "In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. • It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. • Anxiety worsens the effect. • Some athletes become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to perform a skill, such as putting, is impaired. \"Choking\" is an extreme form of performance anxiety that may have a harmful effect on a golfer's or any athlete's game.",
      "Risk factors": "The yips tend to be associated with: Older age. • More experience playing golf. • Tournament play."
