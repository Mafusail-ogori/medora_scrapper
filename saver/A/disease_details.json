      "Overview": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen. • The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. • An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding. • Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. • Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. • This makes them difficult to detect. • Some aneurysms never rupture. • Many start small and stay small. • Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly. • If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice: Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly. • Back pain. • A pulse near the bellybutton. • If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and severe, seek medical help right away. • Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta. • Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen. • Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including: Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis. • Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up on the lining of a blood vessel. • High blood pressure. • High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta's walls. • Blood vessel diseases. • These are diseases that cause blood vessels to become inflamed. • Infection in the aorta. • Rarely, infection by certain bacteria or fungi might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm. • Trauma. • For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm. • Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Tobacco use. • Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. • Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. • This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. • The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. • Men ages 65 to 75 who are current or former smokers should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. • Age. • Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. • Being male. • Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. • Being white. • People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. • Family history. • Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition. • Other aneurysms. • Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. • If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries. • Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include: Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection. • Rupture of the aneurysm. • A rupture can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. • In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture. • Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include: Sudden, intense and persistent belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing. • Low blood pressure. • Fast pulse. • Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. • If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. • Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area. • To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following: Don't smoke or use tobacco products. • If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. • Also avoid secondhand smoke. • If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that may help. • Eat a healthy diet. • Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. • Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt. • Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. • If your care provider prescribed medicines, take them as instructed. • Get regular exercise. • Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. • If you haven't been active, start slowly and build up. • Talk to your health care provider about what kinds of activities are right for you.",

      "Overview": "Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. • They're more common in children than in adults. • A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. • Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. • This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. • But injury can happen if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens. • Absence seizures usually can be managed with antiseizure medicines. • Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. • Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.",
      "Symptoms": "A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. • The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. • There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure. • Symptoms of absence seizures include: A sudden stop in activity without falling. • Lip smacking. • Eyelid flutters. • Chewing motions. • Finger rubbing. • Small movements of both hands. • Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. • But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. • Some people have many episodes daily. • When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities. • A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. • This is because the seizures are so brief. • A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. • Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming. • Contact your child's pediatrician: If you're concerned that your child may be having seizures. • If your child has epilepsy but develops symptoms of a new type of seizure. • If the seizures continue to occur despite taking antiseizure medicine. • Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours. • This may include activities such as eating or moving without awareness. • It also might include prolonged confusion. • These are possible symptoms of a condition called status epilepticus. • After any seizure lasting more than five minutes. • Absence seizures usually have a genetic cause. • In general, seizures occur as a result of a burst of electrical impulses from nerve cells in the brain, called neurons. • Neurons typically send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. • In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. • During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. • People who have seizures also may have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another. • These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters. • Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: Age. • Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. • Sex. • Absence seizures are more common in females. • Family members who have seizures. • Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures. • While most children outgrow absence seizures, some: Must take antiseizure medicines throughout life. • Eventually have full convulsions, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures. • Other complications can include: Trouble with learning. • Trouble with behavior. • Social isolation. • Injury during the seizure.",

      "Overview": "Achalasia is a swallowing condition that affects the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach, called the esophagus. • Damaged nerves make it hard for the muscles of the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. • Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth. • This fermented food can taste bitter. • Achalasia is a fairly rare condition. • Some people mistake it for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). • However, in achalasia, the food is coming from the esophagus. • In GERD, the material comes from the stomach. • There's no cure for achalasia. • Once the esophagus is damaged, the muscles cannot work properly again. • But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and get worse over time. • Symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, which may feel like food or drink is stuck in the throat. • Swallowed food or saliva flowing back into the throat. • Heartburn. • Belching. • Chest pain that comes and goes. • Coughing at night. • Pneumonia from getting food in the lungs. • Weight loss. • Vomiting. • The exact cause of achalasia is poorly understood. • Researchers suspect that it may be caused by a loss of nerve cells in the esophagus. • There are theories about what causes this, but viral infection or autoimmune responses are possibilities. • Very rarely, achalasia may be caused by an inherited genetic disorder or infection. • Risk factors for achalasia include: Age. • Although achalasia can affect people of all ages, it's more common in people between 25 and 60 years of age. • Certain medical conditions. • The risk of achalasia is higher in people with allergic disorders, adrenal insufficiency or Allgrove syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition.",

      "Overview": "Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon rupture is an injury that affects the back of your lower leg. • It mainly occurs in people playing recreational sports, but it can happen to anyone. • The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. • If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture) completely or just partially. • If your Achilles tendon ruptures, you might hear a pop, followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and lower leg that is likely to affect your ability to walk properly. • Surgery is often performed to repair the rupture. • For many people, however, nonsurgical treatment works just as well.",
      "Symptoms": "Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have: The feeling of having been kicked in the calf Pain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel An inability to bend the foot downward or \"push off\" the injured leg when walking An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg A popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs Seek medical advice immediately if you hear a pop in your heel, especially if you can't walk properly afterward. • Your Achilles tendon helps you point your foot downward, rise on your toes and push off your foot as you walk. • You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot. • Rupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. • This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. • Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. • Common examples include: Increasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping Falling from a height Stepping into a hole Factors that may increase your risk of Achilles tendon rupture include: Age. • The peak age for Achilles tendon rupture is 30 to 40. • Sex. • Achilles tendon rupture is up to five times more likely to occur in men than in women. • Recreational sports. • Achilles tendon injuries occur more often during sports that involve running, jumping, and sudden starts and stops — such as soccer, basketball and tennis. • Steroid injections. • Doctors sometimes inject steroids into an ankle joint to reduce pain and inflammation. • However, this medication can weaken nearby tendons and has been associated with Achilles tendon ruptures. • Certain antibiotics. • Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), increase the risk of Achilles tendon rupture. • Obesity. • Excess weight puts more strain on the tendon. • To reduce your chance of developing Achilles tendon problems, follow these tips: Stretch and strengthen calf muscles. • Stretch your calf until you feel a noticeable pull but not pain. • Don't bounce during a stretch. • Calf-strengthening exercises can also help the muscle and tendon absorb more force and prevent injury. • Vary your exercises. • Alternate high-impact sports, such as running, with low-impact sports, such as walking, biking or swimming. • Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your Achilles tendons, such as hill running and jumping activities. • Choose running surfaces carefully. • Avoid or limit running on hard or slippery surfaces. • Dress properly for cold-weather training, and wear well-fitting athletic shoes with proper cushioning in the heels. • Increase training intensity slowly. • Achilles tendon injuries commonly occur after an abrupt increase in training intensity. • Increase the distance, duration and frequency of your training by no more than 10 percent weekly. • Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. • See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.",

      "Overview": "An ACL injury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate (KROO-she-ate) ligament (ACL) — one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia). • ACL injuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops or changes in direction, jumping and landing — such as soccer, basketball, football and downhill skiing. • Many people hear a pop or feel a \"popping\" sensation in the knee when an ACL injury occurs. • Your knee may swell, feel unstable and become too painful to bear weight. • Depending on the severity of your ACL injury, treatment may include rest and rehabilitation exercises to help you regain strength and stability, or surgery to replace the torn ligament followed by rehabilitation. • A proper training program may help reduce the risk of an ACL injury.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of an ACL injury usually include: A loud pop or a \"popping\" sensation in the knee Severe pain and inability to continue activity Rapid swelling Loss of range of motion A feeling of instability or \"giving way\" with weight bearing Seek immediate care if any injury to your knee causes signs or symptoms of an ACL injury. • The knee joint is a complex structure of bones, ligaments, tendons and other tissues that work together. • It's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis to determine the severity of the injury and get proper treatment. • Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another. • The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint. • ACL injuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting) Pivoting with your foot firmly planted Landing awkwardly from a jump Stopping suddenly Receiving a direct blow to the knee or having a collision, such as a football tackle When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. • A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact. • There are a number of factors that increase your risk of an ACL injury, including: Being female — possibly due to differences in anatomy, muscle strength and hormonal influences Participating in certain sports, such as soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and downhill skiing Poor conditioning Using faulty movement patterns, such as moving the knees inward during a squat Wearing footwear that doesn't fit properly Using poorly maintained sports equipment, such as ski bindings that aren't adjusted properly Playing on artificial turf People who experience an ACL injury have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee. • Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament. • Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment. • Proper training and exercise can help reduce the risk of ACL injury. • A sports medicine physician, physical therapist, athletic trainer or other specialist in sports medicine can provide assessment, instruction and feedback that can help you reduce risks. • Programs to reduce ACL injury include: Exercises to strengthen the core — including the hips, pelvis and lower abdomen — with a goal of training athletes to avoid moving the knee inward during a squat Exercises that strengthen leg muscles, particularly hamstring exercises, to ensure an overall balance in leg muscle strength Training and exercise emphasizing proper technique and knee position when jumping and landing from jumps Training to improve technique when performing pivoting and cutting movements Training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and core — as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques and to prevent inward movement of the knee — may help to reduce the higher ACL injury risk in female athletes. • Wear footwear and padding that is appropriate for your sport to help prevent injury. • If you downhill ski, make sure your ski bindings are adjusted correctly by a trained professional so that your skis will release appropriately if you fall. • Wearing a knee brace doesn't appear to prevent ACL injury or reduce the risk of recurring injury after surgery. • Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. • See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.",

      "Overview": "Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. • It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. • Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. • Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. • The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. • Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. • The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.",
      "Symptoms": "Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. • If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. • He or she can prescribe stronger medications. • If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist). • For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. • This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives. • In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention. • The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. • This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products. • Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience: Faintness Difficulty breathing Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue Tightness of the throat Four main factors cause acne: Excess oil (sebum) production Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells Bacteria Inflammation Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. • Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. • The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. • Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. • A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. • But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air. • Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. • Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. • Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne. • Certain things may trigger or worsen acne: Hormonal changes. • Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. • Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too. • Certain medications. • Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium. • Diet. • Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. • Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions. • Stress. • Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse. • These factors have little effect on acne: Chocolate and greasy foods. • Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne. • Hygiene. • Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. • In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse. • Cosmetics. • Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. • Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs. • People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications: Scars. • Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed. • Skin changes. • After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred. • Risk factors for acne include: Age. • People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers. • Hormonal changes. • Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy. • Family history. • Genetics plays a role in acne. • If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too. • Greasy or oily substances. • You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams. • Friction or pressure on your skin. • This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.",

      "Overview": "An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. • This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. • Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. • Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. • Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma. • An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. • An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. • Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions. • Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. • Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. • The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. • Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma. • As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms. • Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include: Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. • In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. • Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side. • Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus. • Loss of balance or not feeling steady. • Dizziness. • Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement. • Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. • See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems. • Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss. • The cause of acoustic neuromas can sometimes be linked to a problem with a gene on chromosome 22. • Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves. • Experts don't know what causes this problem with the gene. • Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. • This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. • People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. • These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas. • The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. • However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases. • A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. • Tumors also may develop on other nerves. • Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. • This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. • Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it. • An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including: Hearing loss. • Facial numbness and weakness. • Balance problems. • Ringing in the ear. • Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. • Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. • This increases the pressure inside the skull.",

      "Overview": "Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. • When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. • In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. • But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. • Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. • Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. • Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. • This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. • But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.",
      "Symptoms": "A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. • For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. • Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. • Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. • Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. • Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: Enlarged hands and feet. • Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue. • Coarse, oily, thickened skin. • Excessive sweating and body odor. • Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags). • Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness. • Pain and limited joint mobility. • A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses. • Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway. • Vision problems. • Headaches, which may be persistent or severe. • Menstrual cycle irregularities in women. • Erectile dysfunction in men. • Loss of interest in sex. • If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. • Acromegaly usually develops slowly. • Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. • But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. • Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it's not treated.",
      "Causes": "Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. • The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. • It produces GH and a number of other hormones. • GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth. • When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. • IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. • Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. • In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production: Pituitary tumors. • Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. • The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. • Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues. • Nonpituitary tumors. • In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. • Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. • In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH.",
      "Risk factors": "People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. • In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. • Those hormones may trigger acromegaly.",
      "Complications": "If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. • Complications may include: High blood pressure (hypertension). • High cholesterol. • Heart problems, particularly enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy). • Osteoarthritis. • Type 2 diabetes. • Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). • Precancerous growths (polyps) on the lining of your colon. • Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. • Carpal tunnel syndrome. • Increased risk of cancerous tumors. • Spinal cord compression or fractures. • Vision changes or vision loss. • Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. • Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death."

      "Overview": "Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. • These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina. • A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. • A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction. • Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. • It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. • But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack. • Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. • It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. • The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. • They include: Chest pain or discomfort. • This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. • Chest pain also is called angina. • Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. • These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw. • Nausea or vomiting. • Indigestion. • Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea. • Sudden, heavy sweating. • Racing heartbeat. • Feeling lightheaded or dizzy. • Fainting. • Unusual fatigue. • Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. • But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. • You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes. • Acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. • Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. • Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. • Do not drive yourself to the hospital.",
      "Causes": "Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. • Fatty deposits also are called plaque. • The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries. • When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. • This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles. • When the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. • The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. • This is called a heart attack. • Even when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don't work the way they should. • This change may be short-lived or permanent. • When acute coronary syndrome doesn't result in cell death, it is called unstable angina.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. • Risk factors include: Getting older. • High blood pressure. • High blood cholesterol. • Smoking tobacco. • Lack of physical activity. • Eating an unhealthy diet. • Obesity or overweight. • Diabetes. • Personal or family history of chest pain, heart attacks or stroke. • History of high blood pressure, preeclampsia or diabetes during pregnancy, and early menopause. • COVID-19 infection."

      "Overview": "Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that happens quickly — in days or weeks — usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. • It's most often caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. • Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly. • Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. • It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization. • Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. • In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of acute liver failure may include: Yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, called jaundice. • Pain in the upper right belly area, called the abdomen. • A swollen belly, known as ascites. • Nausea and vomiting. • A general sense of feeling unwell, known as malaise. • Disorientation or confusion. • Sleepiness. • Breath with a musty or sweet odor. • Tremors. • Acute liver failure can develop quickly in an otherwise healthy person, and it is life-threatening. • If you or someone you know suddenly develops a yellowing of the eyes or skin; tenderness in the upper belly; or any unusual changes in mental state, personality or behavior, seek medical attention right away. • Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are seriously damaged and are no longer able to function. • Possible causes include: Acetaminophen overdose. • Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. • Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. • Acute liver failure can happen after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days. • If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. • Treatment may prevent liver failure. • Don't wait for the symptoms of liver failure. • Hepatitis and other viruses. • Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E increase the risk of acute liver failure. • Other viruses that can increase risk include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. • Prescription medicines. • Some prescription medicines, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure. • Herbal supplements. • Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure. • Toxins. • Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. • Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. • It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials. • Autoimmune disease. • Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which the immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury. • Diseases of the veins in the liver. • Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure. • Metabolic disease. • Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, sometimes cause acute liver failure. • Cancer. • Cancer that either begins in or spreads to the liver can cause the liver to fail. • Shock. • Overwhelming infection, called sepsis, and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure. • Heat stroke. • Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure. • Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause. • Risk factors for acute liver failure include: Being female. • A majority of people affected by acute liver failure are female. • Underlying illness. • Many conditions, including viral hepatitis, metabolic disease, autoimmune disease and cancer can increase the risk of acute liver failure. • Acute liver failure often causes complications, including: Too much fluid in the brain, called cerebral edema. • Too much fluid causes pressure to build up in the brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures. • Bleeding and bleeding disorders. • A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. • Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. • It may be difficult to control. • Infections. • People with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts. • Kidney failure. • Kidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially with an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both the liver and the kidneys. • Reduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver. • Follow instructions on medicines. • If you take acetaminophen or other medicines, check the package insert for the recommended dose, and don't take more than that. • If you already have liver disease, ask your healthcare team if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen. • Tell your healthcare team about all your medicines. • Even nonprescription and herbal medicines can interact with prescription drugs you're taking. • Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Avoid risky behavior. • Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. • Don't share needles. • Use condoms during sex. • If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. • Don't smoke. • Get vaccinated. • If you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your care team about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. • A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A. • Be careful not to come into contact with other people's blood and body fluids. • Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. • Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection. • Don't eat wild mushrooms. • It can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat. • Take care with aerosol sprays. • When you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. • Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. • Follow product instructions carefully. • Watch what gets on your skin. • When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Obesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). • MASLD may lead to serious liver damage.",
      "Causes": "Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are seriously damaged and are no longer able to function. • Possible causes include: Acetaminophen overdose. • Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. • Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. • Acute liver failure can happen after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days. • If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. • Treatment may prevent liver failure. • Don't wait for the symptoms of liver failure. • Hepatitis and other viruses. • Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E increase the risk of acute liver failure. • Other viruses that can increase risk include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. • Prescription medicines. • Some prescription medicines, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure. • Herbal supplements. • Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure. • Toxins. • Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. • Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. • It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials. • Autoimmune disease. • Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which the immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury. • Diseases of the veins in the liver. • Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure. • Metabolic disease. • Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, sometimes cause acute liver failure. • Cancer. • Cancer that either begins in or spreads to the liver can cause the liver to fail. • Shock. • Overwhelming infection, called sepsis, and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure. • Heat stroke. • Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure. • Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause.",

      "Overview": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. • The word \"acute\" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. • The word \"lymphocytic\" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which ALL affects. • Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. • Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. • Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: Bleeding from the gums Bone pain Fever Frequent infections Frequent or severe nosebleeds Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin Pale skin Shortness of breath Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy Make an appointment with your doctor or your child's doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that concern you. • Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu. • However, flu signs and symptoms eventually improve. • If signs and symptoms don't improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor.",
      "Causes": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. • In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing. • When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. • The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. • These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells. • It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia include: Previous cancer treatment. • Children and adults who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other kinds of cancer may have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia. • Exposure to radiation. • People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as survivors of a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia. • Genetic disorders. • Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia."

      "Overview": "Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. • Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. • The word \"acute\" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. • It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. • These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. • AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. • The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. • Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. • AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. • Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include: Fever. • Pain. • Common places for pain include the bones, back and stomach. • Feeling very tired. • Paleness or change in skin color. • Frequent infections. • Easy bruising. • Bleeding with no clear cause, such as in the nose or gums. • Shortness of breath. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. • Acute myelogenous leukemia symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. • The healthcare professional may check for those causes first.",
      "Causes": "It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia. • Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. • The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. • It's where blood cells are made. • The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. • Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. • Healthy myeloid cells can become: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body. • Platelets, which help stop bleeding. • White blood cells, which help fight infections. • Every cell in the body contains DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. • The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop. • The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. • The myeloblasts don't work right. • They can build up in the bone marrow. • They can crowd out healthy blood cells. • Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include: Older age. • Acute myelogenous leukemia is most common in adults age 65 and older. • Prior cancer treatment. • People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may have a greater risk of AML. • Radiation exposure. • People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing AML. • Dangerous chemical exposure. • Certain chemicals, such as benzene, are linked to a greater risk of AML. • Smoking cigarettes. • AML is linked to cigarette smoke, which contains benzene and other known cancer-causing chemicals. • Other blood disorders. • People who've had another blood disorder, such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or thrombocythemia, are at greater risk of AML. • Genetic disorders. • Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of AML. • Family history. • People with a close blood relative, such as a sibling, parent or grandparent with a blood or bone marrow disorder are at higher risk for AML. • Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer."

      "Overview": "Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. • Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. • With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. • Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone. • Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. • Symptoms can start slowly. • Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss. • Addison's disease can affect anyone. • Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. • Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.",
      "Symptoms": "Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. • The disease may happen so slowly that people who have it might ignore the symptoms at first. • Physical stress such as an illness or injury can make symptoms get worse fast. • Early symptoms of Addison's disease can affect you in various ways. • Some early symptoms can cause discomfort or loss of energy, including: Extreme tiredness, also called fatigue. • Dizziness or fainting when standing after sitting or lying down. • This is due to a type of low blood pressure called postural hypotension. • Sweating due to low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia. • Upset stomach, diarrhea or vomiting. • Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. • Muscle cramps, weakness, widespread pain or joint pain. • Other early symptoms can cause changes in how you look, such as: Body hair loss. • Areas of darkened skin, especially on scars and moles. • These changes may be harder to see on Black or brown skin. • Weight loss due to less hunger. • Early Addison's disease symptoms also can affect emotions, mental health and desires. • These symptoms include: Depression. • Irritable mood. • Lower sex drive in women. • Salt craving. • Sometimes the symptoms of Addison's disease become worse fast. • If this happens, it's an emergency known as an adrenal crisis. • You also may hear it called an addisonian crisis or acute adrenal failure. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have Addison's disease with any the following symptoms: Serious weakness. • Sudden, terrible pain in the lower back, stomach area or legs. • Severe upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhea. • Extreme loss of body water, also called dehydration. • Fever. • Confusion or much less awareness of the surroundings. • Loss of consciousness. • Low blood pressure and fainting. • Without fast treatment, an adrenal crisis can lead to death. • See a healthcare professional if you have common symptoms of Addison's disease, such as: Long-lasting fatigue. • Muscle weakness. • Loss of appetite. • Darkened areas of skin. • Weight loss that doesn't happen on purpose. • Serious upset stomach, vomiting or stomach pain. • Lightheadedness or fainting with standing. • Salt cravings. • Get emergency care right away if you have any symptoms of an adrenal crisis. • Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. • These glands sit just above the kidneys. • The adrenal glands are part of the system of glands and organs that makes hormones, also called the endocrine system. • The adrenal glands make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. • The adrenal glands are made up of two layers. • The inner layer, called the medulla, makes hormones such as adrenaline. • Those hormones control the body's response to stress. • The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. • Corticosteroids include: Glucocorticoids.These hormones include cortisol, and they affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. • They also play a role in the immune system and help the body respond to stress. • Mineralocorticoids. • These hormones include aldosterone. • They balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range. • Androgens. • In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. • They cause male sexual development. • And they affect muscle mass, body hair, sex drive, and a sense of well-being in all people. • Addison's disease also is known as primary adrenal insufficiency. • A related condition is called secondary adrenal insufficiency. • These conditions have different causes. • This condition happens when the outer layer of the adrenal glands becomes damaged and can't make enough hormones. • Most often, the damage is due to a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. • This is called an autoimmune disease. • People with Addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well. • Other causes of Addison's disease can include: A serious infection called tuberculosis that mainly affects the lungs and also can destroy the adrenal glands. • Other infections of the adrenal glands. • Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands. • Bleeding into the adrenal glands. • A group of genetic conditions present at birth that affect the adrenal glands. • This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • Medicines that block the body's ability to make glucocorticoid, such as ketoconazole (Ketozole), mitotane (Lysodren) and etomidate (Amidate). • Or medicines that block the action of glucocorticoid in the body, such as mifepristone (Mifeprex, Korlym). • Treatment for cancer with medicines called checkpoint inhibitors. • This type of adrenal insufficiency has many symptoms in common with Addison's disease. • But it's more common than Addison's disease. • Secondary adrenal insufficiency happens when the pituitary gland near the brain doesn't prompt the adrenal glands to make cortisol. • Typically, the pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). • ACTH in turn causes the outer layer of the adrenal glands to make its hormones, including glucocorticoids and androgens. • But with secondary adrenal insufficiency, too little ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too little of these hormones. • Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are like those of Addison's disease. • But people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't develop darkened skin. • And they're less likely to have serious dehydration or low blood pressure. • They're more likely to have low blood sugar. • Factors that can cause the pituitary gland to make too little ACTH include: Pituitary tumors that aren't cancer. • Surgery or radiation therapy of the pituitary gland. • Brain injury. • A short-term cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency can happen in people who suddenly stop taking medicines called corticosteroids. • These medicines treat conditions such as asthma and arthritis. • But stopping the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency. • Most people who get Addison's disease don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing the condition. • But the following may raise the risk of adrenal insufficiency: A history of having a disease or surgery that affects the pituitary gland or the adrenal glands. • Certain genetic changes that affect the pituitary or adrenal glands. • These include gene changes that cause the inherited disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • Other autoimmune endocrine conditions, such as hypothyroidism or type 1 diabetes. • Traumatic brain injury. • Addison's disease can lead to other health conditions called complications. • These include adrenal crisis, also called addisonian crisis. • If you have Addison's disease and haven't started treatment, you may develop this life-threatening complication. • Stress on the body such as injury, infection or illness can trigger adrenal crisis. • Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. • But with adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol to meet this need. • And that can lead to adrenal crisis. • Adrenal crisis results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. • This complication needs treatment right away. • Addison's disease can't be prevented. • But you can take steps to lower the risk of adrenal crisis: Talk with your healthcare professional if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. • Ask if you should get tested for adrenal insufficiency. • If you have Addison's disease, ask your healthcare professional what to do when you're sick. • You'll likely need to learn how to adjust the amount of medicine that you take. • You also may need to take the medicine as a shot. • If you become very sick, go to an emergency room. • This is crucial if you're vomiting and you can't take your medicine. • Some people with Addison's disease worry about serious side effects from corticosteroid medicines. • But people with Addison's disease aren't likely to get the side effects of high-dose corticosteroids used to treat many other diseases. • That's because the dose prescribed is much lower and only replaces the amount that's missing. • If you take corticosteroids, follow up with your healthcare professional regularly to make sure your dose is not too high.",
      "Causes": "Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. • These glands sit just above the kidneys. • The adrenal glands are part of the system of glands and organs that makes hormones, also called the endocrine system. • The adrenal glands make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. • The adrenal glands are made up of two layers. • The inner layer, called the medulla, makes hormones such as adrenaline. • Those hormones control the body's response to stress. • The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. • Corticosteroids include: Glucocorticoids.These hormones include cortisol, and they affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. • They also play a role in the immune system and help the body respond to stress. • Mineralocorticoids. • These hormones include aldosterone. • They balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range. • Androgens. • In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. • They cause male sexual development. • And they affect muscle mass, body hair, sex drive, and a sense of well-being in all people. • Addison's disease also is known as primary adrenal insufficiency. • A related condition is called secondary adrenal insufficiency. • These conditions have different causes. • This condition happens when the outer layer of the adrenal glands becomes damaged and can't make enough hormones. • Most often, the damage is due to a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. • This is called an autoimmune disease. • People with Addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well. • Other causes of Addison's disease can include: A serious infection called tuberculosis that mainly affects the lungs and also can destroy the adrenal glands. • Other infections of the adrenal glands. • Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands. • Bleeding into the adrenal glands. • A group of genetic conditions present at birth that affect the adrenal glands. • This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • Medicines that block the body's ability to make glucocorticoid, such as ketoconazole (Ketozole), mitotane (Lysodren) and etomidate (Amidate). • Or medicines that block the action of glucocorticoid in the body, such as mifepristone (Mifeprex, Korlym). • Treatment for cancer with medicines called checkpoint inhibitors. • This type of adrenal insufficiency has many symptoms in common with Addison's disease. • But it's more common than Addison's disease. • Secondary adrenal insufficiency happens when the pituitary gland near the brain doesn't prompt the adrenal glands to make cortisol. • Typically, the pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). • ACTH in turn causes the outer layer of the adrenal glands to make its hormones, including glucocorticoids and androgens. • But with secondary adrenal insufficiency, too little ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too little of these hormones. • Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are like those of Addison's disease. • But people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't develop darkened skin. • And they're less likely to have serious dehydration or low blood pressure. • They're more likely to have low blood sugar. • Factors that can cause the pituitary gland to make too little ACTH include: Pituitary tumors that aren't cancer. • Surgery or radiation therapy of the pituitary gland. • Brain injury. • A short-term cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency can happen in people who suddenly stop taking medicines called corticosteroids. • These medicines treat conditions such as asthma and arthritis. • But stopping the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency.",
      "Risk factors": "Most people who get Addison's disease don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing the condition. • But the following may raise the risk of adrenal insufficiency: A history of having a disease or surgery that affects the pituitary gland or the adrenal glands. • Certain genetic changes that affect the pituitary or adrenal glands. • These include gene changes that cause the inherited disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • Other autoimmune endocrine conditions, such as hypothyroidism or type 1 diabetes. • Traumatic brain injury.",
      "Complications": "Addison's disease can lead to other health conditions called complications. • These include adrenal crisis, also called addisonian crisis. • If you have Addison's disease and haven't started treatment, you may develop this life-threatening complication. • Stress on the body such as injury, infection or illness can trigger adrenal crisis. • Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. • But with adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol to meet this need. • And that can lead to adrenal crisis. • Adrenal crisis results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. • This complication needs treatment right away.",
      "Prevention": "Addison's disease can't be prevented. • But you can take steps to lower the risk of adrenal crisis: Talk with your healthcare professional if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. • Ask if you should get tested for adrenal insufficiency. • If you have Addison's disease, ask your healthcare professional what to do when you're sick. • You'll likely need to learn how to adjust the amount of medicine that you take. • You also may need to take the medicine as a shot. • If you become very sick, go to an emergency room. • This is crucial if you're vomiting and you can't take your medicine. • Some people with Addison's disease worry about serious side effects from corticosteroid medicines. • But people with Addison's disease aren't likely to get the side effects of high-dose corticosteroids used to treat many other diseases. • That's because the dose prescribed is much lower and only replaces the amount that's missing. • If you take corticosteroids, follow up with your healthcare professional regularly to make sure your dose is not too high."

      "Overview": "Adjustment disorders are excessive reactions to stress that involve negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in behavior. • The reaction to a stressful change or event is much more intense than would typically be expected. • This can cause a lot of problems in getting along with others, as well as at work or school. • Work problems, going away to school, an illness or any number of life changes can cause stress. • Most of the time, people get used to such changes within a few months. • But if you have an adjustment disorder, you continue to have emotional or behavioral responses that can make you feel more anxious or depressed. • Treatment can help you regain your emotional well-being.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. • These symptoms can vary from person to person. • You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life. • Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. • They also may affect your actions or behavior. • Some examples include: Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy. • Crying often. • Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out. • Feeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start. • Having trouble sleeping. • Not eating enough. • Having difficulty concentrating. • Having difficulty with daily activities. • Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially. • Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills. • Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts. • Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. • These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. • But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. • This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed. • Stressors are usually temporary. • You learn to cope with them over time. • Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases. • But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life. • Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. • Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. • You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. • If you have concerns about your child's behavior, talk with your child's doctor. • The risk of suicide can be higher in people who have adjustment disorders. • If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling: In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. • It's available 24 hours a day, every day. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and private. • U.S. veterans or service members who are in crisis can call 988 and then press \"1\" for the Veterans Crisis Line. • Or text 838255. • Or chat online. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish-language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free).",
      "Causes": "Adjustment disorders are caused by major changes or stressors in your life. • Genetics, your life experiences and your temperament may make it more likely that an adjustment disorder happens.",
      "Risk factors": "Stressful life events and experiences ― positive and negative ― may put you at risk of having an adjustment disorder. • Examples include: Major stress as a child, such as bullying or difficulties with school. • Divorce or marriage problems. • Relationship problems or trouble getting along with others. • Major changes in life, such as retirement, having a baby or moving away. • Bad experiences, such as losing a job, loss of a loved one or having money problems. • Problems in school or at work. • Life-threatening experiences, such as physical assault, combat or natural disaster. • Ongoing stressors, such as having a medical illness or living in a neighborhood that has a lot of crime. • More than one major change or bad experience happening at the same time. • Other mental health conditions, such as major depression, intense anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Complications": "If adjustment disorders do not resolve, they eventually can lead to more-serious mental health conditions such as anxiety, major depression, or misuse of drugs or alcohol.",
      "Prevention": "There are no guaranteed ways to prevent adjustment disorders. • But social support, healthy coping skills and learning to recover quickly from hard times may help you during times of high stress. • If you know that a stressful situation is coming up, such as a move or retirement, plan ahead. • In advance, increase your healthy habits and ask your friends and family for support. • Remind yourself that stressful situations pass in time and that you can get through them. • Also, consider checking in with your health care team or mental health professional to review healthy ways to manage your stress."

      "Overview": "Adrenal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in an adrenal gland. • The adrenal glands are small, triangular glands located on top of the kidneys. • Although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body. • They make hormones that help control metabolism, blood pressure and other important functions. • Adrenal cancer is rare, and it can happen at any age. • It's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. • Adrenal cancer also is called adrenocortical carcinoma. • When adrenal cancer is found early, a cure may be possible. • When the cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands, a cure becomes less likely. • In that situation, treatment may be used to keep the cancer from spreading more. • Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are not cancer. • The medical term for that is benign. • An example of an adrenal growth that is not cancer is adrenal adenoma.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer may include: Back pain. • Belly pain. • Losing weight without trying. • Loss of appetite. • Many people who have adrenal cancer develop hormone changes in the body. • These changes can happen if the cancer cells make extra hormones. • Most often, the adrenal cancer makes the hormone cortisol. • This can cause symptoms of Cushing syndrome, including: Weight gain. • Muscle weakness. • Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. • Bruises that happen even with a small injury. • High blood pressure. • High blood sugar or diabetes. • Less often, an adrenal cancer might make the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. • In females, changes in the sex hormones can cause extra facial hair, hair loss on the head and periods that aren't regular. • In males, these hormone changes may cause the testicles to shrink and breast tissue to get bigger. • Rarely, adrenal cancer may make the hormone aldosterone. • That can cause high blood pressure and low levels of potassium in the blood. • Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes adrenal cancer. • Adrenal cancer happens when cells in the adrenal gland develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA tells the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The DNA also tells the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.",
      "Risk factors": "Adrenal cancer happens more often in people who inherit certain health conditions that raise the risk of some cancers. • Those health conditions include: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. • Familial adenomatous polyposis. • Li-Fraumeni syndrome. • Lynch syndrome. • Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, also called MEN 1. • Healthcare professionals haven't found anything that can prevent adrenal cancer."

      "Overview": "Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. • Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. • You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. • For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd. • The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. • You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. • Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. • They then avoid the places where it may happen again. • Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. • You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. • The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home. • Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. • But with proper treatment — usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines — you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.",
      "Symptoms": "Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of: Leaving home alone. • Crowds or waiting in line. • Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. • Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. • Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train. • These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. • Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. • In addition: Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation. • You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset. • You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance. • Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer. • Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. • Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. • A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. • You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. • Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks. • Symptoms of a panic attack can include: Rapid heart rate. • Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking. • Chest pain or pressure. • Lightheadedness or dizziness. • Feeling shaky, numb or tingling. • Sweating too much. • Sudden flushing or chills. • Upset stomach or diarrhea. • Feeling a loss of control. • Fear of dying. • Agoraphobia can severely limit your ability to socialize, work, attend important events and even manage the details of daily life, such as running errands. • Don't let agoraphobia make your world smaller. • Call your health care provider or a mental health professional if you have symptoms of agoraphobia or panic attacks. • Biology — including health conditions and genetics — personality, stress and learning experiences may all play a role in the development of agoraphobia. • Agoraphobia can begin in childhood, but usually starts in the late teen or early adult years — usually before age 35. • But older adults also can develop it. • Females are diagnosed with agoraphobia more often than males are. • Risk factors for agoraphobia include: Having panic disorder or other excessive fear reactions, called phobias. • Responding to panic attacks with too much fear and avoidance. • Experiencing stressful life events, such as abuse, the death of a parent or being attacked. • Having an anxious or nervous personality. • Having a blood relative with agoraphobia. • Agoraphobia can greatly limit your life's activities. • If your agoraphobia is severe, you may not even be able to leave your home. • Without treatment, some people become housebound for years. • If this happens to you, you may not be able to visit with family and friends, go to school or work, run errands, or take part in other routine daily activities. • You may become dependent on others for help. • Agoraphobia also can lead to: Depression. • Alcohol or drug misuse. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior. • There's no sure way to prevent agoraphobia. • But anxiety tends to increase the more you avoid situations that you fear. • If you start to have mild fears about going places that are safe, try to practice going to those places over and over again. • This can help you feel more comfortable in those places. • If this is too hard to do on your own, ask a family member or friend to go with you, or seek professional help. • If you experience anxiety going places or have panic attacks, get treatment as soon as possible. • Get help early to keep symptoms from getting worse. • Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.",

      "Overview": "The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism (OCA). • OCA is a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. • The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. • Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems. • Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. • People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer. • Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision. • The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. • But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. • People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. • For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. • With exposure to the sun, some people may develop: Freckles. • Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. • Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). • Sunburn and no ability to tan. • For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. • For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color. • Hair color can range from very white to brown. • People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. • Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. • Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. • Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. • Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. • With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. • This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. • Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. • Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. • Eye problems may include: Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. • An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better. • Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. • Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. • Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. • A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision. • Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. • This difference results in reduced vision. • Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. • This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. • Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. • Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness. • At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. • The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision. • If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider. • Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. • These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.",
      "Causes": "Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. • Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes. • Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. • Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. • The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin. • Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected. • Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene — one from each parent. • This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. • OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. • OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. • The amount of pigment varies by type. • The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types. • Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. • The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. • This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. • X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. • This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. • Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. • It's much less common than OCA. • Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. • For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. • Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors depend on whether one or both parents carry an affected gene. • Different types of albinism have different types of inheritance patterns.",
      "Complications": "Albinism can include skin and eye complications. • It also can include social and emotional challenges. • Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive. • People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. • Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. • Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. • Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer. • Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. • This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. • Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced. • Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. • The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition. • People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. • They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. • These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress. • Using the term \"person with albinism\" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.",
      "Prevention": "If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. • The counselor can explain the available genetic tests."

      "Overview": "Alcohol poisoning is a serious — and sometimes deadly — result of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. • Drinking too much too quickly can affect breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex. • In some cases, this can lead to a coma and death. • Alcohol poisoning also can occur when adults or children accidentally or intentionally drink household products that contain alcohol. • If you think that someone has alcohol poisoning, get medical attention right away.",
      "Symptoms": "Alcohol poisoning symptoms include: Confusion. • Vomiting. • Seizures. • Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute. • Breathing that's not regular. • This is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths. • Skin that looks blue, gray or pale. • Low body temperature, also known as hypothermia. • Trouble staying conscious or awake. • It's not necessary to have all the above symptoms before seeking medical help. • A person with alcohol poisoning who has passed out or can't wake up could die. • If you think that someone has alcohol poisoning, seek medical care right away. • This is true even if you don't see the usual signs. • Here's what to do: Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. • Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. • Be prepared to give information. • If you know the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when, tell hospital or emergency staff. • Don't leave an unconscious person alone. • Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may vomit and choke and not be able to breathe. • While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because that could cause choking. • Help someone who is vomiting. • Try to keep the person sitting up. • If the person must lie down, turn the head to the side to help prevent choking. • Try to keep the person awake. • It can be hard to decide if you think someone is drunk enough to need medical help. • But it's best to take action right away rather than be sorry later. • You may worry about what will happen to you or a friend or family member, especially if underage. • But the results of not getting help in time can be far more serious. • Alcohol in the form of ethanol, also called ethyl alcohol, is in alcoholic beverages. • It's also in mouthwash, some cooking extracts, some medicines and certain household products. • Ethyl alcohol poisoning generally results from drinking too many alcoholic beverages in a short period of time. • Other forms of alcohol can cause toxic poisoning that requires emergency treatment. • They include: Isopropyl alcohol, which is found in rubbing alcohol, lotions and some cleaning products. • Methanol or ethylene glycol, which is a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents. • A major cause of alcohol poisoning is binge drinking. • This is when a male rapidly consumes five or more alcoholic drinks within two hours or a female consumes at least four drinks within two hours. • An alcohol binge can occur over hours or last up to several days. • A person can consume a fatal dose of alcohol before passing out. • Even when the person is unconscious or stops drinking, the stomach and intestines continue to release alcohol into the bloodstream, and the level of alcohol in the body continues to rise. • Unlike food, which can take hours to digest, the body absorbs alcohol quickly — long before most other nutrients. • And it takes a lot more time for the body to get rid of alcohol. • Most alcohol is processed by the liver. • The more you drink, especially in a short period of time, the greater your risk of alcohol poisoning. • Here's what one drink means. • Beer: 12 fluid ounces (360 milliliters) with about 5% alcohol. • Malt liquor: 8 to 9 fluid ounces (240 to 270 milliliters) with about 7% alcohol. • Wine: 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) with about 12% alcohol. • Liquor such as gin, rum, vodka or whiskey: 1.5 fluid ounces (45 milliliters) of an 80-proof drink, which has about 40% alcohol. • But the amount of alcohol in one drink may be much higher than those in the list above. • For example, some craft beers may have four times the amount of alcohol that's in a regular beer. • Alcohol content is displayed on the label. • Or you can ask the server about alcohol content. • Be aware of the alcohol content of what you're drinking and adjust how much you drink based on this knowledge. • Mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol. • Several factors can increase your risk of alcohol poisoning, including: Your height and weight. • Health conditions that affect how your body processes alcohol. • Whether you've eaten recently. • Whether you've had alcohol along with other drugs, including medicines you take for health reasons. • The percentage of alcohol in your drinks. • How fast and how much alcohol you drink. • How your body processes alcohol. • Severe complications can result from alcohol poisoning, including: Choking. • Alcohol may cause vomiting. • Because it depresses the gag reflex, this increases the risk of choking on vomit if a person passes out. • Stopping breathing. • Accidentally inhaling vomit into the lungs can lead to a dangerous or fatal interruption of breathing, also known as asphyxiation. • Severe loss of fluids. • Vomiting can result in severe dehydration, which happens when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids. • This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and a fast heart rate. • Seizures. • The blood sugar level may drop low enough to cause seizures. • Hypothermia. • The body temperature may drop so low that it leads to cardiac arrest. • Unusual heartbeat. • Alcohol poisoning can cause a heartbeat that is not regular. • It can even cause the heart to stop. • Brain damage. • Heavy drinking may cause brain damage that can't be reversed. • Death. • Any of the issues above can lead to death. • To avoid alcohol poisoning: Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to two drinks a day for males and one drink a day for females. • When you drink, enjoy your drink slowly. • Don't drink alcohol along with certain medicines. • Some medicines can cause harmful effects when taken with even small amounts of alcohol. • And certain health conditions may mean it takes less alcohol than expected to reach the level of alcohol poisoning. • Ask your health care provider if these risks apply to you. • Don't drink on an empty stomach. • Having some food in your stomach may slow the process of absorbing alcohol somewhat. • But it won't prevent alcohol poisoning during binge drinking. • Communicate with your teens. • Talk to your teenagers about the dangers of alcohol, including binge drinking. • Evidence suggests that children who are warned about alcohol by their parents and who report close relationships with their parents are less likely to start drinking. • Store products safely. • If you have small children, store alcohol-containing products, including cosmetics, mouthwashes and medicines, out of their reach. • Use childproof bathroom and kitchen cabinets to prevent access to household cleaners. • Keep toxic items in your garage or storage area safely out of reach. • Consider keeping alcoholic beverages under lock and key. • Get follow-up care. • Ask about follow-up care for alcohol poisoning. • Meeting with a health care provider, particularly an experienced chemical dependency counselor, can help prevent future binge drinking.",

      "Overview": "Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. • This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. • Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism. • Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. • It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. • Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks. • If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. • It can range from mild to severe. • However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important.",
      "Symptoms": "Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. • Signs and symptoms may include: Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal. • Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. • The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. • Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. • These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. • You can also have periods called \"blackouts,\" where you don't remember events. • Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death. • Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. • It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. • Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. • Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations. • The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol) If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. • Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. • Because denial is common, you may feel like you don't have a problem with drinking. • You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. • Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. • Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped. • Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don't recognize that they have a problem. • An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. • If you're concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. • Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. • Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder. • Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. • This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones. • Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. • Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include: Steady drinking over time. • Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder. • Starting at an early age. • People who begin drinking — especially binge drinking — at an early age are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder. • Family history. • The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. • This may be influenced by genetic factors. • Depression and other mental health problems. • It's common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances. • History of trauma. • People with a history of emotional trauma or other trauma are at increased risk of alcohol use disorder. • Having bariatric surgery. • Some research studies indicate that having bariatric surgery may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder or of relapsing after recovering from alcohol use disorder. • Social and cultural factors. • Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. • The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it's OK to drink too much. • For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk. • Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. • In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy. • But as you continue to drink, you become drowsy and have less control over your actions. • Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. • A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. • This is of particular concern when you're taking certain medications that also depress the brain's function. • Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning Relationship problems Poor performance at work or school Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime Legal problems or problems with employment or finances Problems with other substance use Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or experiencing sexual abuse or date rape Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: Liver disease. • Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis). • Over time, heavy drinking can cause irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis). • Digestive problems. • Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. • It can also interfere with your body's ability to get enough B vitamins and other nutrients. • Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). • Heart problems. • Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. • Even a single binge can cause serious irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) called atrial fibrillation. • Diabetes complications. • Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). • This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin or some other diabetes medications to lower your blood sugar level. • Issues with sexual function and periods. • Heavy drinking can cause men to have difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). • In women, heavy drinking can interrupt menstrual periods. • Eye problems. • Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamin). • A thiamin deficiency can result in other brain changes, such as irreversible dementia, if not promptly treated. • Birth defects. • Alcohol use during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. • It may also cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). • FASDs can cause a child to be born with physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime. • Bone damage. • Alcohol may interfere with making new bone. • Bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. • Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. • This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding. • Neurological complications. • Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. • Weakened immune system. • Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. • Increased risk of cancer. • Long-term, excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, esophagus, colon and breast cancers. • Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. • Medication and alcohol interactions. • Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. • Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous. • Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. • If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol: Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd Declining grades and problems in school Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior You can help prevent teenage alcohol use: Set a good example with your own alcohol use. • Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life. • Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules.",

      "Complications": "Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. • In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy. • But as you continue to drink, you become drowsy and have less control over your actions. • Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. • A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. • This is of particular concern when you're taking certain medications that also depress the brain's function. • Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning Relationship problems Poor performance at work or school Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime Legal problems or problems with employment or finances Problems with other substance use Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or experiencing sexual abuse or date rape Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: Liver disease. • Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis). • Over time, heavy drinking can cause irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis). • Digestive problems. • Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. • It can also interfere with your body's ability to get enough B vitamins and other nutrients. • Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). • Heart problems. • Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. • Even a single binge can cause serious irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) called atrial fibrillation. • Diabetes complications. • Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). • This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin or some other diabetes medications to lower your blood sugar level. • Issues with sexual function and periods. • Heavy drinking can cause men to have difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). • In women, heavy drinking can interrupt menstrual periods. • Eye problems. • Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamin). • A thiamin deficiency can result in other brain changes, such as irreversible dementia, if not promptly treated. • Birth defects. • Alcohol use during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. • It may also cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). • FASDs can cause a child to be born with physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime. • Bone damage. • Alcohol may interfere with making new bone. • Bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. • Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. • This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding. • Neurological complications. • Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss. • Weakened immune system. • Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia. • Increased risk of cancer. • Long-term, excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, esophagus, colon and breast cancers. • Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. • Medication and alcohol interactions. • Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. • Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous.",
      "Prevention": "Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. • If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol: Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd Declining grades and problems in school Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior You can help prevent teenage alcohol use: Set a good example with your own alcohol use. • Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life. • Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules."

      "Overview": "Alcoholic hepatitis is swelling, called inflammation, of the liver caused by drinking alcohol. • Drinking alcohol destroys liver cells. • Alcoholic hepatitis most often happens in people who drink heavily over many years. • But the link between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis isn't simple. • Not all heavy drinkers get alcoholic hepatitis. • And some people who drink much less get the disease. • If you're diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, you must stop drinking alcohol. • People who keep drinking alcohol have a high risk of serious liver damage and death.",
      "Symptoms": "The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. • The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people. • Other symptoms include: Loss of appetite. • Nausea and vomiting. • Belly tenderness. • Fever, often low grade. • Tiredness and weakness. • People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry. • And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol. • Other symptoms that happen with severe alcoholic hepatitis include: Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites. • Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins. • The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them. • Kidney and liver failure. • Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious, often deadly disease. • See a healthcare professional if you: Have symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis. • Can't control your drinking. • Want help cutting back on your drinking.",
      "Causes": "Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by damage to the liver from drinking alcohol. • Just how alcohol damages the liver and why it does so only in some heavy drinkers isn't clear. • These factors are known to play a role in alcoholic hepatitis: The body's way of breaking down alcohol makes highly toxic chemicals. • These chemicals trigger swelling, called inflammation, that destroys liver cells. • Over time, scars replace healthy liver tissue. • This keeps the liver from working well. • This scarring, called cirrhosis, can't be fixed. • It's the final stage of alcoholic liver disease. • Other factors that can be involved with alcoholic hepatitis include: Other types of liver disease. • Alcoholic hepatitis can make chronic liver diseases worse. • For instance, if you have hepatitis C and drink, even a little, you're more likely to get liver scarring than if you don't drink. • Lack of nutrition. • Many people who drink heavily don't get enough nutrients because they eat poorly. • And alcohol keeps the body from using nutrients as it should. • Lack of nutrients can damage liver cells.",
      "Risk factors": "The major risk factor for alcoholic hepatitis is the how much alcohol you drink. • It isn't known how much alcohol it takes to cause alcoholic hepatitis. • Most people with this condition have had at least seven drinks a day for 20 years or more. • This can mean 7 glasses of wine, 7 beers, or 7 shots of spirits. • However, alcoholic hepatitis can happen to people who drink less and have other risk factors, including: Sex. • Women seem to have a higher risk of getting alcoholic hepatitis. • That might be because of how alcohol breaks down in women's bodies. • Obesity. • Heavy drinkers who are overweight might be more likely to get alcoholic hepatitis. • And they might be more likely to go on to get liver scarring. • Genes. • Studies suggest that genes might be involved in alcohol-induced liver disease. • Race and ethnicity. • Black and Hispanic people might be at higher risk of alcoholic hepatitis. • Binge drinking. • Having five or more drinks in about two hours for men and four or more for women might increase the risk of alcoholic hepatitis.",
      "Complications": "Complications of alcoholic hepatitis are caused by scar tissue on the liver. • Scar tissue can slow blood flow through the liver. • That can raise pressure in a major blood vessel called the portal vein and cause a buildup of toxins. • Complications include: Enlarged veins, called varices. • Blood that can't flow freely through the portal vein can back up into other blood vessels in the stomach and the tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach, called the esophagus. • These blood vessels have thin walls. • They're likely to bleed if filled with too much blood. • Heavy bleeding in the upper stomach or esophagus is life-threatening and needs medical care right away. • Ascites (ah-SITE-ees). • Fluid that builds up in the belly might get infected and need treatment with antibiotics. • Ascites isn't life-threatening. • But it most often means advanced alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. • Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech, called hepatic encephalopathy. • A damaged liver has trouble removing toxins from the body. • The buildup of toxins can damage the brain. • Severe hepatic encephalopathy can cause a coma. • Kidney failure. • A damaged liver can affect blood flow to the kidneys. • This can damage the kidneys. • Cirrhosis. • This scarring of the liver can lead to liver failure.",
      "Prevention": "You might reduce your risk of alcoholic hepatitis if you: Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. • For healthy adults, moderate drinking means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • The only certain way to prevent alcoholic hepatitis is to avoid all alcohol. • Protect yourself from hepatitis C. • Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a virus. • Without treatment, it can lead to cirrhosis. • If you have hepatitis C and drink alcohol, you're far more likely to get cirrhosis than if you don't drink. • Check before mixing medicines and alcohol. • Ask your healthcare professional if it's safe to drink alcohol when taking your prescribed medicines. • Read the warning labels on medicines you can get without a prescription. • Don't drink alcohol when taking medicines that warn against drinking alcohol while taking them. • This includes pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)."

      "Overview": "Allergies happen when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance that gets inside the body. • These substances are known as allergens. • They include pollen, bee venom and pet dander. • Allergies also can happen due to certain foods and medicines that don't cause reactions in most people. • The immune system makes protective proteins called antibodies that attack invaders such as germs. • But with allergies, the immune system makes antibodies that mark a specific allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. • Coming into contact with the allergen causes an immune system reaction that can inflame the skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system. • Allergic reactions vary from person to person. • They can range from minor irritation to a life-threatening emergency called anaphylaxis. • While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. • The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. • Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. • Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis. • Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, can cause: Sneezing. • Itching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouth. • Runny, stuffy nose. • Tiredness, also called fatigue. • Watery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis. • A food allergy can cause: Tingling in the mouth. • Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat. • Itchy welts called hives. • Stuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itch. • Stomach cramps, vomiting or diarrhea. • Anaphylaxis. • An insect sting allergy can cause: Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting site. • Itching or hives all over the body. • Skin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushing. • Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath. • Anaphylaxis. • A medicine allergy can cause: Hives. • Itchy skin or rash. • Facial swelling. • Wheezing. • Shortness of breath. • Vomiting or diarrhea. • Feeling dizzy. • Anaphylaxis. • Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to: Itch. • Form red or brown patches that may be harder to see on darker skin tones. • Flake, peel or crack. • Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. • Certain foods, insect stings and medicines are among the allergens that can set off this life-threatening emergency. • Anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock. • Other symptoms include: Passing out. • A drop in blood pressure. • Severe shortness of breath and throat tightness. • Skin rash with hives or welts. • Dizziness. • A rapid, weak pulse. • Upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhea. • A sense of doom. • You might see a healthcare professional if you have symptoms that you think are caused by an allergy, and over-the-counter allergy medicines sold without a prescription didn't give you enough relief. • If you have symptoms after starting a new medicine for a health condition, call the healthcare professional who prescribed it right away. • For a severe allergic reaction, also called anaphylaxis, call 911 or your local emergency number. • Or get emergency medical help. • A shot of prescription medicine called epinephrine is needed to treat anaphylaxis. • If you carry an epinephrine auto-injector (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others), give yourself a shot right away. • Even if your symptoms get better after an epinephrine shot, go to the emergency room. • Healthcare professionals need to make sure your symptoms don't come back when the effects of the shot wear off. • If you've had a severe allergy attack or any symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past, make an appointment to see your healthcare professional. • Allergy testing and the creation of a long-term treatment plan to manage anaphylaxis can be a challenge. • So you'll likely need to see a doctor called an allergist who finds and treats allergies and other immune system conditions. • Various substances can cause allergies. • An allergy starts when the immune system mistakes a substance that's usually harmless for a dangerous invader. • The immune system then makes antibodies that stay on the alert for that specific allergen. • When you're exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies can release some immune system chemicals that cause allergy symptoms. • Common allergy triggers include: Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mold. • Certain foods, especially peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk. • Insect stings, such as from a bee or wasp. • Medicines, especially penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics. • Latex or other substances you touch, which can cause allergic skin reactions. • Risk factors for allergies include: Having a family history of asthma or allergies, such as hay fever, hives or eczema. • Being a child. • Having asthma or another allergic condition. • Having an allergy raises the risk of certain other health conditions called complications, including: Anaphylaxis. • If you have severe allergies, that raises your risk of this serious allergic reaction. • Foods, medicines, latex and insect stings are the most common triggers of anaphylaxis. • Asthma. • If you have an allergy, you're more likely to have asthma. • Asthma is an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing. • Often, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment. • This is known as allergy-induced asthma. • Infections of the sinuses, ears or lungs. • Your risk of getting these conditions is higher if you have hay fever or asthma. • Preventing allergic reactions depends on the type of allergy you have. • General measures include the following: Stay away from known triggers. • Do this even if you get treatment for your allergy symptoms. • If, for instance, you're allergic to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high. • If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often. • You also can use \"mite-proof\" covers for items such as pillows, comforters, mattresses and box springs. • Keep a diary. • When trying to figure out what causes your allergic symptoms or makes them worse, track your activities and what you eat. • Also note when symptoms happen and what seems to help. • This may help you and your healthcare professional find your triggers. • Wear a medical alert bracelet. • If you've had a severe allergic reaction, wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. • It lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're not able to speak.",

      "Overview": "Alpha-gal syndrome is a type of food allergy. • It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals. • In the United States, the condition usually begins with the bite of the Lone Star tick. • The bite transfers a sugar molecule called alpha-gal into the body. • In some people, this triggers a reaction from the body's defenses, also called the immune system. • It causes mild to severe allergic reactions to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. • It also can cause reactions to other foods that come from mammals, such as dairy products or gelatins. • The Lone Star tick is found mainly in the southeastern United States. • Most cases of alpha-gal syndrome are reported in the south, east and central United States. • But the condition appears to be spreading farther north and west. • Deer are carrying the Lone Star tick to new parts of the country. • Other types of ticks carry alpha-gal molecules in different parts of the world. • Alpha-gal syndrome has been diagnosed in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. • Some people may have alpha-gal syndrome and not know it. • There are people who often have serious allergic reactions, also called anaphylactic reactions, for no clear reason. • Tests also show that they don't have other food allergies. • Researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome. • There's no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals. • If you have a serious allergic reaction, you may need medicine called epinephrine and treatment at the emergency room. • Avoid tick bites to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. • Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you're in wooded, grassy areas. • Use bug spray too. • Check your whole body for ticks after you spend time outside.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. • Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. • In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. • Foods that can cause a reaction include: Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. • Organ meats. • Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products. • Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. • Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. • Wheezing or shortness of breath. • Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting. • The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. • For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. • Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. • They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body. • Get help if you have food allergy symptoms after you eat, even several hours after you eat. • See your primary care health care provider or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. • Don't rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction. • That's even more important if you live or spend time in parts of the world where alpha-gal syndrome has been reported. • Get emergency medical treatment if you have symptoms of a serious allergic reaction that causes trouble breathing, called anaphylaxis, such as: Trouble breathing. • Rapid, weak pulse. • Dizzy or lightheaded feeling. • Drooling and not being able to swallow. • Full-body redness and warmth, called flushing. • Most people with alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S. get the condition when a Lone Star tick bites them. • Bites from other types of ticks can lead to the condition too. • These other ticks cause alpha-gal syndrome in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. • Experts think the ticks that cause alpha-gal syndrome carry alpha-gal molecules. • These come from the blood of the animals they usually bite, such as cows and sheep. • When a tick that carries these molecules bites a human, the tick sends alpha-gal into the person's body. • For unknown reasons, some people have a strong immune response to these molecules. • The body makes proteins called antibodies. • These antibodies target alpha-gal as something the immune system needs to clear out. • The response is so strong that people with this allergy can no longer eat red meat. • They cannot eat any foods made from mammals without having an allergic reaction. • People who get many tick bites over time may develop worse symptoms. • People with antibodies related to alpha-gal syndrome can have allergic reactions to the cancer drug cetuximab (Erbitux). • Research appears to show that cases of this drug allergy are linked to alpha-gal syndrome. • The antibodies that the immune system makes to alpha-gal seem to react to the structure of the drug as well. • Health care providers don't yet know why some people get alpha-gal syndrome after exposure and others don't. • The condition mostly happens in the south, east and central United States. • You're at higher risk if you live or spend time in these regions and: Spend a lot of time outdoors. • Have gotten multiple Lone Star tick bites. • In the past 20 to 30 years, the Lone Star tick has been found in large numbers as far north as Maine. • This tick also has been found as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma. • Alpha-gal syndrome also happens in other parts of the world. • This includes parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. • In those places, bites from certain types of ticks also appear to raise the risk of the condition. • Alpha-gal syndrome can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. • It can be deadly without treatment. • Anaphylaxis is treated with prescription medicine called epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. • You can give yourself a shot of epinephrine with a device called an auto-injector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others). • You also need to go to the emergency room. • Anaphylaxis symptoms can include: Tight, narrow airways. • Swelling of the throat that makes it hard to breathe. • A serious drop in blood pressure, called shock. • Rapid pulse. • Feeling dizzy or lightheaded, or passing out Health care providers think that some people who get anaphylaxis often and for no clear reason may be living with alpha-gal syndrome. • They just haven't been diagnosed with it. • The best way to prevent alpha-gal syndrome is to avoid areas where ticks live. • Be careful in wooded, bushy areas with long grass. • You can lower your risk of getting alpha-gal syndrome by following some simple tips: Cover up. • Dress to protect yourself when you're in wooded or grassy areas. • Wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. • Also try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. • If you have a dog, keep it on a leash too. • Use bug spray. • Apply insect repellent with a 20% or higher concentration of the ingredient DEET to your skin. • If you're a parent, put the bug spray on your children. • Avoid their hands, eyes and mouths. • Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. • Apply products with the ingredient permethrin to clothing, or buy pre-treated clothing. • Do your best to tick-proof your yard. • Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. • Keep woodpiles in sunny areas. • Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. • Be watchful after you spend time in wooded or grassy areas. • It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. • Ticks often stay on your skin for hours before they attach themselves. • Shower and use a washcloth to try to remove any ticks. • Remove a tick with tweezers as soon as possible. • Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. • Don't squeeze or crush the tick. • Pull it off with a careful, steady grip. • Once you've removed the entire tick, throw it out. • Put on an antiseptic where it bit you. • That can help prevent an illness.",

      "Overview": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. • Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. • This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink. • About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. • Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. • Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. • Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. • Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks. • There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. • In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. • These complications can result in death. • But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. • Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.",
      "Symptoms": "Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. • Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. • Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur. • At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. • As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. • Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time. • Everyone has trouble with memory at times, but the memory loss related to Alzheimer's disease is lasting. • Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work and at home. • People with Alzheimer's disease may: Repeat statements and questions over and over. • Forget conversations, appointments or events. • Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense. • Get lost in places they used to know well. • Forget the names of family members and everyday objects. • Have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations. • Alzheimer's disease causes trouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. • Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. • It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. • Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease may not recognize numbers. • Alzheimer's disease makes it hard to make sensible decisions and judgments. • People with Alzheimer's disease may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. • Everyday problems may be hard to solve. • Someone with Alzheimer's disease may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or how to make decisions when driving. • Routine activities that involve completing steps in a certain order also can be hard for people with Alzheimer's disease. • They may have trouble planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. • As Alzheimer's disease becomes advanced, people forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. • Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. • Symptoms may include: Depression. • Loss of interest in activities. • Social withdrawal. • Mood swings. • Not trusting others. • Anger or aggression. • Changes in sleeping habits. • Wandering. • Loss of inhibitions. • Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't. • Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to keep some skills even as symptoms get worse. • These are known as preserved skills. • They may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. • Preserved skills may last longer because they're managed by parts of the brain affected in later stages of the disease. • Several conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. • Some of those conditions can be treated. • If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional. • If you are concerned about the thinking skills you notice in a family member or friend, ask about going together to talk to a healthcare professional. • The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. • But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. • This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. • The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. • They eventually die. • Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. • In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. • For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age. • The disease begins years before the first symptoms. • The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. • The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. • By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk. • Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins: Plaques. • Beta-amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein. • When these fragments clump together, they affect communication between brain cells. • The clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques. • Tangles. • Tau proteins play a part in a brain cell's internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials. • In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins change mshape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles. • The tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells. • Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, lifestyle and other factors. • Older age is the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. • Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. • But as you grow older, the chances of getting the disease goes up. • One study found that there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74 every year. • Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. • For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. • The risk of getting Alzheimer's disease is higher if a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling was diagnosed with the disease. • How genes among families affect the risk is largely not understood. • The genetic factors are likely complex. • A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. • Having the form of the gene known as APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. • About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. • But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. • Having two copies of APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease more than having one copy. • Scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. • But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease. • Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. • This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. • Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. • Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. • Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population. • Overall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men. • Someone with mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, has a bigger decline in memory or other thinking skills than is usual for the person's age. • But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning at work or socially. • However, people with MCI have a higher risk of getting dementia than are people who don't have mild cognitive impairment. • When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. • A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. • They also can schedule regular healthcare appointments to monitor symptoms. • Several large studies found that people age 50 or older who had a traumatic brain injury, also called TBI, had a higher risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease. • The risk is even higher in people with serious TBIs or multiple TBIs. • Studies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. • Human studies have found that air pollution exposure — especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is linked to a higher risk of dementia. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. • Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol misuse is linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially early-onset dementia. • Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to a raised risk of Alzheimer's disease. • Sleep apnea also may raise the risk of dementia. • Research has shown that the same risk factors for heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. • It's not clear if these factors raise risk by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to blood vessel changes in the brain. • The factors include: Lack of exercise. • Obesity. • Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke. • High blood pressure. • High cholesterol. • Poorly managed type 2 diabetes. • High levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol in middle age, in particular, raises the risk of dementia. • Research has found that people younger than 65 with high LDL cholesterol levels have a higher risk of dementia. • But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol didn't raise the risk. • These factors can all be modified, so changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. • For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. • Studies have found that people who have hearing loss are at risk of dementia. • The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. • However, wearing hearing aids protects against getting dementia. • Newer research suggests vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. • The link may be due to a disease such as diabetes that can increase the risk of both vision loss and dementia. • But some research suggests vision loss itself may increase the risk of dementia. • Studies have found that being social and doing activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. • Low education levels — less than a high school education — appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. • Alzheimer's disease can lead to a variety of complications. • Symptoms such as memory loss, language loss, impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions. • A person with Alzheimer's disease may not be able to: Tell someone about being in pain. • Explain symptoms of another illness. • Follow a treatment plan. • Explain medicine side effects. • As Alzheimer's disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions. • The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and manage stool and bladder movements. • These effects can lead to other health issues such as: Inhaling food or liquid into the lungs. • Flu, pneumonia and other infections. • Falls. • Fractures. • Bedsores. • Poor nutrition or dehydration. • Constipation or diarrhea. • Alzheimer's disease can't be prevented. • But making lifestyle changes can lower your risk of getting the disease. • Research suggests that taking steps that lower your risk of cardiovascular disease may reduce the risk of dementia, as well. • To follow heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may lower the risk of dementia: Exercise regularly. • Eat a diet of fresh produce, healthy oils and foods low in saturated fat, such as a Mediterranean diet. • Work with your healthcare professional to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. • Pay particular attention to your levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol. • High levels of LDL cholesterol in people younger than 65 raises the risk of dementia. • But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol doesn't raise the risk. • If you smoke, ask your healthcare professional for help to quit. • One large, long-term study done in Finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia. • Those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet, exercise and social activities. • Several studies have found that following a Mediterranean diet leads to better cognitive function and a slower cognitive decline with age. • A Mediterranean diet focuses on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, poultry, nuts and olive oil. • The diet includes less foods that are high in saturated fats and trans fats, such as butter, margarine, cheese, red meat, fried food and pastries. • It's also important to treat vision loss and hearing loss. • Studies have found that vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. • Studies also have found that people who have hearing loss are at higher risk of dementia. • But wearing hearing aids made people less likely to get dementia. • Other studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. • This includes going to social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument and other activities.",

      "Overview": "Ameloblastoma is a rare, noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops most often in the jaw near the molars. • Ameloblastoma begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on your teeth. • The most common type of ameloblastoma is aggressive, forming a large tumor and growing into the jawbone. • Treatment may include surgery and radiation. • In some cases, reconstruction may be necessary to restore your teeth, jaw and facial appearance. • Some types of ameloblastoma are less aggressive. • Though ameloblastoma is most often diagnosed in adults in their 30s through 60s, ameloblastoma can occur in children and young adults.",
      "Symptoms": "Ameloblastoma often causes no symptoms, but signs and symptoms may include pain and a lump or swelling in the jaw. • If left untreated, the tumor can grow very large, distorting the shape of the lower face and jaw and shifting teeth out of position. • Talk to your dentist or health care provider if you have jaw swelling or pain or any other concerns with your oral health.",
      "Causes": "Ameloblastoma begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on your teeth. • Rarely, it may start in gum tissue. • The exact cause of the tumor is unclear, but several genetic changes (mutations) may be involved in the development of ameloblastoma. • These changes may impact the location of the tumor, the type of cells involved and how fast the tumor grows. • Ameloblastomas are generally classified by type, but they can also be classified by cell type. • The four main types include: Conventional ameloblastoma. • This is the most common type and grows aggressively, usually in the lower jawbone, and approximately 10% recur after treatment. • Unicystic ameloblastoma. • This type is less aggressive, but typically occurs at a younger age. • The tumor is often in the back of the lower jawbone at the molars. • Recurrence is possible after treatment. • Peripheral ameloblastoma. • This type is rare and affects the gums and oral tissue in the upper or lower jaw. • The tumor has a low risk of recurrence after treatment. • Metastasizing ameloblastoma. • This type is very rare and is defined by tumor cells that occur away from the primary site in the jaw.",
      "Complications": "Rarely, ameloblastoma can become cancerous (malignant). • Very rarely, ameloblastoma cells can spread to other areas of the body (metastasize), such as the lymph nodes in the neck and lungs. • Ameloblastoma may recur after treatment."

      "Overview": "Amenorrhea (uh-men-o-REE-uh) is the absence of menstruation, often defined as missing one or more menstrual periods. • Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation in someone who has not had a period by age 15. • The most common causes of primary amenorrhea relate to hormone levels, although anatomical problems also can cause amenorrhea. • Secondary amenorrhea refers to the absence of three or more periods in a row by someone who has had periods in the past. • Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, although problems with hormones also can cause secondary amenorrhea. • Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause.",
      "Symptoms": "Depending on the cause of amenorrhea, you might experience other signs or symptoms along with the absence of periods, such as: Milky nipple discharge Hair loss Headache Vision changes Excess facial hair Pelvic pain Acne Consult your doctor if you've missed at least three menstrual periods in a row, or if you've never had a menstrual period and you're age 15 or older. • Amenorrhea can occur for a variety of reasons. • Some are normal, while others may be a side effect of medication or a sign of a medical problem. • During the normal course of your life, you may experience amenorrhea for natural reasons, such as: Pregnancy Breastfeeding Menopause Some people who take birth control pills (oral contraceptives) may not have periods. • Even after stopping birth control pills, it may take some time before regular ovulation and menstruation return. • Contraceptives that are injected or implanted also may cause amenorrhea, as can some types of intrauterine devices. • Certain medications can cause menstrual periods to stop, including some types of: Antipsychotics Cancer chemotherapy Antidepressants Blood pressure drugs Allergy medications Sometimes lifestyle factors contribute to amenorrhea, for instance: Low body weight. • Excessively low body weight — about 10% under normal weight — interrupts many hormonal functions in the body, potentially halting ovulation. • Women who have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, often stop having periods because of these abnormal hormonal changes. • Excessive exercise. • Women who participate in activities that require rigorous training, such as ballet, may find their menstrual cycles interrupted. • Several factors combine to contribute to the loss of periods in athletes, including low body fat, stress and high energy expenditure. • Stress. • Mental stress can temporarily alter the functioning of your hypothalamus — an area of your brain that controls the hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle. • Ovulation and menstruation may stop as a result. • Regular menstrual periods usually resume after your stress decreases. • Many types of medical problems can cause hormonal imbalance, including: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). • PCOS causes relatively high and sustained levels of hormones, rather than the fluctuating levels seen in the normal menstrual cycle. • Thyroid malfunction. • An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can cause menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea. • Pituitary tumor. • A noncancerous (benign) tumor in your pituitary gland can interfere with the hormonal regulation of menstruation. • Premature menopause. • Menopause usually begins around age 50. • But, for some women, the ovarian supply of eggs diminishes before age 40 and menstruation stops. • Problems with the sexual organs themselves also can cause amenorrhea. • Examples include: Uterine scarring. • Asherman's syndrome, a condition in which scar tissue builds up in the lining of the uterus, can sometimes occur after a dilation and curettage (D&C), cesarean section or treatment for uterine fibroids. • Uterine scarring prevents the normal buildup and shedding of the uterine lining. • Lack of reproductive organs. • Sometimes problems arise during fetal development that lead to missing parts of the reproductive system, such as the uterus, cervix or vagina. • Because the reproductive system didn't develop fully, menstrual cycles aren't possible later in life. • Structural abnormality of the vagina. • An obstruction of the vagina may prevent visible menstrual bleeding. • A membrane or wall may be present in the vagina that blocks the outflow of blood from the uterus and cervix. • Factors that may increase your risk of amenorrhea include: Family history. • If other women in your family have experienced amenorrhea, you may have inherited a predisposition for the problem. • Eating disorders. • If you have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, you are at higher risk of developing amenorrhea. • Athletic training. • Rigorous athletic training can increase your risk of amenorrhea. • History of certain gynecologic procedures. • If you've had a D&C, especially related to pregnancy, or a procedure known as loop electrodiathermy excision procedure (LEEP), your risk of developing amenorrhea is higher. • The causes of amenorrhea can cause other problems as well. • These include: Infertility and problems with pregnancy. • If you don't ovulate and don't have menstrual periods, you can't become pregnant. • When hormone imbalance is the cause of amenorrhea, this can also cause miscarriage or other problems with pregnancy. • Psychological stress. • Not having periods when your peers are having theirs can be stressful, especially for young people who are transitioning into adulthood. • Osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. • These two problems can be caused by not having enough estrogen. • Osteoporosis is a weakening of the bones. • Cardiovascular disease includes heart attack and problems with the blood vessels and heart muscle. • Pelvic pain. • If an anatomical problem is causing the amenorrhea, it may also cause pain in the pelvic area.",

      "Complications": "The causes of amenorrhea can cause other problems as well. • These include: Infertility and problems with pregnancy. • If you don't ovulate and don't have menstrual periods, you can't become pregnant. • When hormone imbalance is the cause of amenorrhea, this can also cause miscarriage or other problems with pregnancy. • Psychological stress. • Not having periods when your peers are having theirs can be stressful, especially for young people who are transitioning into adulthood. • Osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. • These two problems can be caused by not having enough estrogen. • Osteoporosis is a weakening of the bones. • Cardiovascular disease includes heart attack and problems with the blood vessels and heart muscle. • Pelvic pain. • If an anatomical problem is causing the amenorrhea, it may also cause pain in the pelvic area."

      "Overview": "Amnesia refers to the loss of memories, including facts, information and experiences. • Movies and television tend to depict amnesia as forgetting your identity, but that's not generally the case in real life. • Instead, people with amnesia — also called amnestic syndrome — usually know who they are. • But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories. • Amnesia can be caused by damage to areas of the brain that are vital for memory processing. • Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent. • There's no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause. • Tips to help enhance memory and get support can help people with amnesia and their families cope.",
      "Symptoms": "The two main features of amnesia are: Trouble learning new information. • Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information. • Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. • Recent memories are most likely to be lost. • More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. • For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. • But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. • Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. • It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. • People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. • They may understand they have a memory disorder. • Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. • Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. • These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. • Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. • This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia. • Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include: False memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time. • Confusion or disorientation. • Anyone who experiences unexplained memory loss, head injury or confusion requires immediate medical attention. • People with amnesia may not know where they are or be able to seek medical care. • If someone you know has symptoms of amnesia, help the person get medical attention.",
      "Causes": "Typical memory function involves many parts of the brain. • Any disease or injury that affects the brain can affect memory. • Amnesia can result from damage to brain structures that form the limbic system, which controls emotions and memories. • They include the thalamus found deep within the center of the brain. • They also include the hippocampal formations found within the temporal lobes of the brain. • Amnesia caused by brain injury or damage is known as neurological amnesia. • Possible causes of neurological amnesia include: Stroke. • Brain inflammation, which may be due to an infection with a virus such as herpes simplex virus. • Or inflammation may be a result of an autoimmune reaction to cancer somewhere in the body. • It also may be due to an autoimmune reaction in the absence of cancer. • Not enough oxygen in the brain. • This may happen as a result of a heart attack, respiratory distress or carbon monoxide poisoning. • Long-term alcohol misuse that leads to too little vitamin B-1, known as thiamin, in the body. • When this happens, it's called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. • Tumors in areas of the brain that control memory. • Alzheimer's disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of nerve tissue. • Seizures. • Certain medicines such as benzodiazepines or others that act as sedatives. • Head injuries that cause a concussion, whether from a car accident or sports, can lead to confusion and problems remembering new information. • This is especially common in the early stages of recovery. • Mild head injuries typically don't cause lasting amnesia, but more-severe head injuries may cause permanent amnesia. • Another rare type of amnesia, called dissociative amnesia, stems from emotional shock or trauma. • It can result from being the victim of a violent crime or experiencing other trauma. • In this disorder, people may lose personal memories and information about their lives. • The memory loss is usually brief.",
      "Risk factors": "The chance of developing amnesia might increase if you've experienced: Brain surgery, head injury or trauma. • Stroke. • Alcohol abuse. • Seizures.",
      "Complications": "Amnesia varies in severity and scope. • But even mild amnesia takes a toll on daily activities and quality of life. • The syndrome can cause problems at work, at school and in social settings. • It may not be possible to recover lost memories. • Some people with severe memory problems need to be supervised or need to live in a care facility.",
      "Prevention": "Damage to the brain can be a root cause of amnesia. • It's important to take steps to minimize your chance of a brain injury. • For example: Don't drink large amounts of alcohol. • Wear a helmet when bicycling and a seat belt when driving. • Treat infections quickly so that they don't have a chance to spread to the brain. • Get immediate medical treatment if you have symptoms that suggest a stroke or brain aneurysm. • Those symptoms include a severe headache, feeling numb on one side of the body or not being able to move one side of the body."

      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of ampullary cancer may include: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. • Diarrhea. • Clay-colored stools. • Abdominal pain. • Fever. • Blood in the stool. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Weight loss. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any persistent symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes ampullary cancer. • Ampullary cancer happens when cells in the ampulla of Vater develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase the risk of ampullary cancer include: Increasing age. • Ampullary cancer is more common in adults older than 70. • DNA changes that run in families. • Some DNA changes that are passed down from your parents can increase your risk of ampullary cancer and other cancers. • Examples include the DNA changes that are linked to Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, also called FAP, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. • There is no way to prevent ampullary cancer."

      "Overview": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a-my-o-TROE-fik LAT-ur-ul skluh-ROE-sis), known as ALS, is a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. • ALS causes loss of muscle control. • The disease gets worse over time. • ALS is often called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it. • The exact cause of the disease is still not known. • A small number of cases are inherited. • ALS often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, trouble swallowing or slurred speech. • Eventually ALS affects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. • There is no cure for this fatal disease.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of ALS vary from person to person. • Symptoms depend on which nerve cells are affected. • ALS generally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time. • Symptoms might include: Trouble walking or doing usual daily activities. • Tripping and falling. • Weakness in the legs, feet or ankles. • Hand weakness or clumsiness. • Slurred speech or trouble swallowing. • Weakness associated with muscle cramps and twitching in the arms, shoulders and tongue. • Untimely crying, laughing or yawning. • Thinking or behavioral changes. • ALS often starts in the hands, feet, arms or legs. • Then it spreads to other parts of the body. • Muscles get weaker as more nerve cells die. • This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing. • There's generally no pain in the early stages of ALS. • Pain also is not common in the later stages. • ALS doesn't usually affect bladder control. • It also usually doesn't affect the senses, including the ability to taste, smell, touch and hear. • ALS affects the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movements such as walking and talking. • These nerve cells are called motor neurons. • There are two groups of motor neurons. • The first group extends from the brain to the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. • They're referred to as upper motor neurons. • The second group extends from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. • They're referred to as lower motor neurons. • ALS causes both groups of motor neurons to gradually deteriorate and then die. • When motor neurons are damaged, they stop sending messages to the muscles. • As a result, the muscles can't function. • For about 10% of people with ALS, a genetic cause can be identified. • For the rest, the cause is not known. • Researchers continue to study possible causes of ALS. • Most theories center on a complex interaction between genes and factors in the environment. • Established risk factors for ALS include: Genetics. • For about 10% of people with ALS, a risk gene was passed down from a family member. • This is called hereditary ALS. • In most people with hereditary ALS, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene. • Age. • Risk increases with age up to age 75. • ALS is most common between the ages of 60 and the mid-80s. • Sex. • Before the age of 65, slightly more men than women develop ALS. • This sex difference disappears after age 70. • Environmental factors, such as the following, have been associated with an increased risk of ALS. • Smoking. • Evidence supports that smoking is an environmental risk factor for ALS. • Women who smoke seem to be at even higher risk, particularly after menopause. • Environmental toxin exposure. • Some evidence suggests that exposure to lead or other substances in the workplace or at home might be linked to ALS. • Much study has been done, but no one agent or chemical has been consistently associated with ALS. • Military service. • Studies indicate that people who have served in the military are at higher risk of ALS. • It's not clear what about military service might trigger ALS. • It might include exposure to certain metals or chemicals, traumatic injuries, viral infections, or intense exertion. • As the disease progresses, ALS causes complications, such as: Over time, ALS leads to weakness of the muscles used to breathe. • People with ALS might need a device such as a mask ventilator to help them breathe at night. • The device is similar to what someone with sleep apnea might wear. • This type of device supports the person's breathing through a mask worn over the nose, the mouth or both. • Some people with advanced ALS choose to have a tracheostomy. • This is a surgically created hole at the front of the neck leading to the windpipe. • A ventilator may work better on a tracheostomy than on a mask. • The most common cause of death for people with ALS is breathing failure. • Half of people with ALS die within 14 to 18 months of diagnosis. • However, some people with ALS live 10 years or longer. • Most people with ALS develop weakness of the muscles used to form speech. • This usually starts with slower speech and occasional slurring of words. • It then becomes harder to speak clearly. • This can progress to the point that others can't understand the person's speech. • Other forms of communication and technology are used to communicate. • People with ALS can develop weakness of the muscles involved with swallowing. • This can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. • They are also at higher risk of getting food, liquids or saliva into the lungs, which can cause pneumonia. • A feeding tube can reduce these risks and ensure proper hydration and nutrition. • Some people with ALS have problems with language and decision-making. • Some are eventually diagnosed with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia.",

      "Overview": "Anemia is a problem of not having enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. • Hemoglobin is a protein found in red cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all other organs in the body. • Having anemia can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath. • There are many forms of anemia. • Each has its own cause. • Anemia can be short term or long term. • It can range from mild to severe. • Anemia can be a warning sign of serious illness. • Treatments for anemia might involve taking supplements or having medical procedures. • Eating a healthy diet might prevent some forms of anemia.",
      "Symptoms": "Anemia symptoms depend on the cause and how bad the anemia is. • Anemia can be so mild that it causes no symptoms at first. • But symptoms usually then occur and get worse as the anemia gets worse. • If another disease causes the anemia, the disease can mask the anemia symptoms. • Then a test for another condition might find the anemia. • Certain types of anemia have symptoms that point to the cause. • Possible symptoms of anemia include: Tiredness. • Weakness. • Shortness of breath. • Pale or yellowish skin, which might be more obvious on white skin than on Black or brown skin. • Irregular heartbeat. • Dizziness or lightheadedness. • Chest pain. • Cold hands and feet. • Headaches. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you're tired or short of breath and don't know why. • Low levels of the protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen, called hemoglobin, is the main sign of anemia. • Some people learn they have low hemoglobin when they donate blood. • If you're told that you can't donate because of low hemoglobin, make a medical appointment. • Anemia occurs when the blood doesn't have enough hemoglobin or red blood cells. • This can happen if: The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells. • Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced. • The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that's in them. • The body makes three types of blood cells. • White blood cells fight infection, platelets help blood clot and red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. • Red blood cells have an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color, called hemoglobin. • Hemoglobin lets red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. • And it lets red blood cells carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to the lungs to be breathed out. • Spongy matter inside many of the large bones, called bone marrow, makes red blood cells and hemoglobin. • To make them, the body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from foods. • Different types of anemia have different causes. • They include: Iron deficiency anemia. • Too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia. • Bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. • Without enough iron, the body can't make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. • Pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they don't take iron supplements. • Blood loss also can cause it. • Blood loss might be from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer or regular use of some pain relievers, especially aspirin. • Vitamin deficiency anemia. • Besides iron, the body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to make enough healthy red blood cells. • A diet that doesn't have enough of these and other key nutrients can result in the body not making enough red blood cells. • Also, some people can't absorb vitamin B-12. • This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also called pernicious anemia. • Anemia of inflammation. • Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells. • Examples are cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease. • Aplastic anemia. • This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't make enough new blood cells. • Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals. • Anemias linked to bone marrow disease. • Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood. • The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life-threatening. • Hemolytic anemias. • This group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. • Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed. • Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited. • Sickle cell anemia. • This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia. • An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle. • These irregular blood cells die too soon. • That causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells. • These factors can increase risk of anemia: A diet that doesn't have enough of certain vitamins and minerals. • Not getting enough iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases the risk of anemia. • Problems with the small intestine. • Having a condition that affects how the small intestine takes in nutrients increases the risk of anemia. • Examples are Crohn's disease and celiac disease. • Menstrual periods. • In general, having heavy periods can create a risk of anemia. • Having periods causes the loss of red blood cells. • Pregnancy. • Pregnant people who don't take a multivitamin with folic acid and iron are at an increased risk of anemia. • Ongoing, called chronic, conditions. • Having cancer, kidney failure, diabetes or another chronic condition increases the risk of anemia of chronic disease. • These conditions can lead to having too few red blood cells. • Slow, chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within the body can use up the body's store of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia. • Family history. • Having a family member with a type of anemia passed through families, called inherited, can increase the risk of inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia. • Other factors. • A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune conditions increases the risk of anemia. • Drinking too much alcohol, being around toxic chemicals, and taking some medicines can affect the making of red blood cells and lead to anemia. • Age. • People over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia. • If not treated, anemia can cause many health problems, such as: Severe tiredness. • Severe anemia can make it impossible to do everyday tasks. • Pregnancy complications. • Pregnant people with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to have complications, such as premature birth. • Heart problems. • Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat, called arrhythmia. • With anemia, the heart must pump more blood to make up for too little oxygen in the blood. • This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure. • Death. • Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can lead to life-threatening complications. • Losing a lot of blood quickly causes severe anemia and can be fatal. • Many types of anemia can't be prevented. • But eating a healthy diet might prevent iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias. • A healthy diet includes: Iron. • Iron-rich foods include beef and other meats, beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, and dried fruit. • Folate. • This nutrient, and its human-made form folic acid, can be found in fruits and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables, green peas, kidney beans, peanuts, and enriched grain products, such as bread, cereal, pasta and rice. • Vitamin B-12. • Foods rich in vitamin B-12 include meat, dairy products, and fortified cereals and soy products. • Vitamin C. • Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits and juices, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, melons, and strawberries. • These also help the body take in iron. • If you're concerned about getting enough vitamins and minerals from food, ask your health care provider about taking a multivitamin.",

      "Overview": "Angelman syndrome is a condition caused by a change in a gene, called a genetic change. • Angelman syndrome causes delayed development, problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures. • Many people with Angelman syndrome smile and laugh often. • They tend to be happy and easy to excite. • Delays in maturing, called developmental delays, begin between about 6 and 12 months of age. • The delays often are the first signs of Angelman syndrome. • Seizures may begin between the ages of 2 and 3 years old. • People with Angelman syndrome tend to live close to a typical life span. • But the condition can't be cured. • Treatment focuses on managing medical, sleep and developmental issues.",
      "Symptoms": "Angelman syndrome symptoms include: Developmental delays, including no crawling or babbling at 6 to 12 months. • Mental disability, also called intellectual disability. • No speech or little speech. • Trouble walking, moving or balancing. • Smiling and laughing often and seeming happy. • Being easy to excite. • Trouble sucking or feeding. • Trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. • People who have Angelman syndrome also may have: Seizures, often beginning between 2 and 3 years of age. • Stiff or jerky movements. • Small head size by age 2. • Tongue thrusting. • Hair, skin and eyes that are light in color. • Odd behaviors, such as hand flapping and arms uplifted while walking. • Crossed eyes, also caused strabismus. • Curved spine, also called scoliosis. • Most babies with Angelman syndrome don't show symptoms at birth. • The first signs of Angelman syndrome most often are developmental delays. • This includes lack of crawling or babbling between 6 and 12 months. • If your child seems to have developmental delays or if your child has other symptoms of Angelman syndrome, make an appointment with your child's healthcare professional.",
      "Causes": "Angelman syndrome is caused by changes in a gene, called a genetic change. • It's most often caused by changes in a gene on chromosome 15 called the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. • You receive your pairs of genes from your parents. • One copy comes from your mother, called the maternal copy. • The other comes from your father, called the paternal copy. • Your cells most often use information from both copies. • But in a small number of genes, such as the UBE3A gene, only the copy from the mother is active. • Most often, the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene helps the brain develop. • Angelman syndrome happens when part of the maternal copy is missing or damaged. • So the brain can't get the information it needs to develop and control speech and movement. • Rarely, Angelman syndrome is caused when two paternal copies of the gene are passed down instead of one from each parent.",
      "Risk factors": "Angelman syndrome is rare. • Researchers often don't know what causes the genetic changes that result in the disease. • Most people with Angelman syndrome don't have a family history. • But sometimes Angelman syndrome may be passed down from a parent. • A family history of the disease may increase a baby's risk of getting Angelman syndrome.",
      "Complications": "Complications linked to Angelman syndrome include: Trouble feeding. • Trouble sucking and swallowing together may cause feeding problems in infants. • Your child's healthcare professional may suggest a high-calorie formula to help your baby gain weight. • Hyperactivity. • Children with Angelman syndrome often move quickly from one activity to another, have a short attention span, and keep their hands or a toy in their mouths. • Hyperactivity often decreases with age. • Medicine often isn't needed. • Sleep troubles. • People with Angelman syndrome often have changes in their sleep-wake patterns. • They may need less sleep than most people. • Sleep troubles may improve with age. • Medicine and behavior therapy may help. • Curving of the spine, also called scoliosis. • Some people with Angelman syndrome get a side-to-side spinal curve over time. • Obesity. • Obesity is common in older children with Angelman syndrome.",
      "Prevention": "Rarely, Angelman syndrome may be passed from an affected parent to a child through changed genes. • If you're concerned about a family history of Angelman syndrome or if you have a child with the condition, seek medical advice. • Your healthcare professional or a genetic counselor can help you plan future pregnancies."

      "Overview": "Angina (an-JIE-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. • Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease. • Angina also is called angina pectoris. • Angina is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. • It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest. • Angina may be a new pain that needs to be checked by a healthcare professional, or it may be recurring pain that goes away with treatment. • Angina is relatively common. • But some people may not be able to tell it apart from other types of chest pain, such as heartburn. • If you have unexplained chest pain, get medical help right away. • There are different types of angina. • The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medicine eases symptoms. • Stable angina. • Stable angina is the most common form of angina. • It usually happens during activity, also called exertion. • It goes away with rest or angina medicine. • Pain that starts when you're walking uphill or in the cold weather may be angina. • Stable angina is predictable. • It is usually similar to previous episodes of chest pain. • The chest pain typically lasts a short time, perhaps five minutes or less. • Unstable angina, which is a medical emergency. • Unstable angina is unpredictable and occurs at rest. • Or the pain is worsening and occurs with less physical effort. • Unstable angina is typically severe and lasts longer than stable angina, maybe 20 minutes or longer. • The pain doesn't go away with rest or the usual angina medicines. • If the blood flow doesn't improve, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen. • A heart attack occurs. • Unstable angina is dangerous and needs emergency treatment. • Variant angina, also called Prinzmetal angina. • This type of angina isn't due to coronary artery disease. • It's caused by a spasm in the heart's arteries. • The spasm temporarily reduces blood flow. • Severe chest pain is the main symptom of variant angina. • It most often occurs in cycles, typically at rest and overnight. • The pain may be relieved by angina medicine. • Refractory angina. • Angina episodes are frequent despite a combination of medicines and lifestyle changes.",
      "Symptoms": "Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. • The chest pain or discomfort may feel like: Burning. • Fullness. • Pressure. • Squeezing. • Pain also may be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back. • Other symptoms of angina include: Dizziness. • Fatigue. • Nausea. • Shortness of breath. • Sweating. • The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. • New or different symptoms may signal unstable angina or a heart attack. • Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be checked immediately by a healthcare professional. • The healthcare team can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina. • Symptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms. • These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. • For example, chest pain may not be the only symptom or the most common symptom. • Other symptoms of angina in women may include: Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back. • Nausea. • Shortness of breath. • Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure. • Stomach pain. • Chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away with rest or angina medicines may be due to a heart attack. • Call 911 or emergency medical help. • Only drive yourself to the hospital if there is no other way to get there. • If chest discomfort is a new symptom for you, see a healthcare professional to determine the cause and to get proper treatment. • If you have stable angina and it gets worse or changes, seek medical help immediately. • Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. • Blood carries oxygen, which the heart muscle needs to survive. • When the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia. • The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD). • The heart arteries, called the coronary arteries, can become narrowed by fatty deposits called plaques. • This condition is called atherosclerosis. • Plaque in a blood vessel may rupture or cause a blood clot. • These events can quickly block or reduce flow through a narrowed artery. • This can suddenly and severely decrease blood flow to the heart muscle. • The heart muscle may still be able to work during times of low oxygen demand without triggering angina symptoms. • An example is when resting. • But when the demand for oxygen goes up, such as when exercising, angina can result. • The following things may increase the risk of angina: Increasing age. • Angina is most common in adults age 60 and older. • Family history of heart disease. • Tell your healthcare team if your mother, father or any siblings have or had heart disease or a heart attack. • Tobacco use. • Smoking, chewing tobacco and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the lining of the arteries. • Artery damage can let deposits of cholesterol collect and block blood flow. • Diabetes. • Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. • Coronary artery disease can cause angina. • High blood pressure. • Over time, high blood pressure damages arteries by speeding up the hardening of the arteries. • High cholesterol or triglycerides. • Too much bad cholesterol, called low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the blood can cause arteries to narrow. • A high LDL level increases the risk of angina and heart attack. • A high level of triglycerides in the blood also is unhealthy. • Other health conditions. • Chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, metabolic syndrome or a history of stroke increases the risk of angina. • Not enough exercise. • An inactive lifestyle raises the risk of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. • Talk with your healthcare team about the type and amount of exercise that's best for you. • Obesity. • Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, which can cause angina. • Being overweight makes the heart work harder to supply blood to the body. • Emotional stress. • Too much stress and anger can raise blood pressure. • Rushes of hormones made by the body during stress can narrow the arteries and worsen angina. • Medicines. • Some medicines tighten blood vessels, which may trigger Prinzmetal angina. • An example is certain migraine medicines. • Drug misuse. • Cocaine and other stimulants can cause blood vessel spasms and trigger angina. • Cold temperatures. • Exposure to cold temperatures can trigger Prinzmetal angina. • The chest pain that occurs with angina can make doing some activities, such as walking, uncomfortable. • However, the most dangerous complication is a heart attack. • Pressure, fullness or a squeezing pain in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes. • Pain extending beyond the chest to the shoulder, arm or back, or even to the teeth and jaw. • Fainting. • Threatening sense of doom. • Increasing episodes of chest pain. • Nausea and vomiting. • Continued pain in the upper belly area. • Shortness of breath. • Sweating. • If you have any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical attention immediately. • You can help prevent angina by following the same lifestyle changes that are used to treat angina: Avoid or limit alcohol. • Don't smoke. • Eat a healthy diet. • Exercise regularly. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Manage other health conditions related to heart disease. • Reduce stress. • Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a day. • Also get recommended vaccines to avoid heart complications.",

      "Overview": "Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. • Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. • But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight. • People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. • To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. • They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives. • Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. • This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. • So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior. • If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. • Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. • Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide. • Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. • Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. • With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.",
      "Symptoms": "The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. • It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. • Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. • Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. • Physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa may include irregular heart rhythms, low blood pressure and dehydration. • Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out normal functions. • Your fingers may look blue and you may have dry skin. • You may notice a change in your skin color, such as yellowing of the skin. • You may have hair that thins, breaks or falls out. • You also may have soft, downy hair covering your body. • Other physical symptoms include: Extreme weight loss or not making expected weight gains based on age. • Being very tired and weak. • Dizziness or fainting. • Having a hard time passing stool and having stomach pain. • Not able to stand the cold, or feeling cold when others feel fine. • Swelling of the arms or legs. • Wearing away of the teeth and calluses on your knuckles from causing yourself to vomit. • Stomachaches. • Never feeling hungry or feeling hungry and getting full right away after eating a very small portion. • Having a hard time concentrating or focusing. • Low mood. • Increased anxiety. • Stress fractures or reduced bone mass. • If you're female and not taking a contraceptive, you may not have menstrual periods. • You may have an extreme focus on food. • Sometimes this includes cooking meals for others but not eating those meals. • You may skip meals or refuse to eat. • You also may severely limit the amount of food you eat through dieting or fasting, not admit to being hungry, or make excuses for not eating. • When you eat, you may eat only a few certain \"safe\" foods — often foods low in fat and calories. • You also may focus too much on eating \"clean\" or healthy and stop eating specific types of food in a way that has not been recommended by a healthcare professional. • You may take on rigid meal or eating habits, such as spitting out food after chewing. • You may not want to eat in public. • You also may lie about how much food you've eaten. • You may have a type of anorexia where you binge and purge like with bulimia. • Binges are when you feel like you can't control what or how much you eat. • Binges can sometimes be large amounts of food. • But overall, if you have the binge-purge type of anorexia, you eat much less than you need. • Purges are when you make yourself vomit, or you misuse enemas, laxatives, diuretics, diet aids or herbal products to get rid of food that you ate. • You lose too much weight and have very low body weight, compared with your personal weight history. • Other emotional and behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include: Too much exercise. • This includes exercising when you're injured, instead of doing something you value or enjoy, or exercising to such a degree of intensity that it's notably different from the people around you. • Fear of weight gain. • Being scared to gain weight may include the need to weigh or measure your body over and over again. • Focus on appearance. • This includes checking in the mirror often for what you think are flaws and wearing layers of clothing to cover up. • Concern about being overweight. • This includes concerns about being fat or having parts of the body that are fat. • Emotional changes. • You may lack emotion or feel emotionally flat. • You may not want to be social. • You also could be angry or irritable. • You may have little interest in sex. • Trouble sleeping. • This also is known as insomnia. • You also may hurt yourself. • Or you may think or talk about suicide or attempt suicide. • Because of how malnutrition affects the brain, someone with anorexia may not want to be treated. • A core feature of anorexia is that people with the eating disorder usually don't see how serious their symptoms are. • This is because of the way anorexia affects the brain. • If someone in your life has anorexia, it's better to take action — even if you think it could be an overreaction — rather than let symptoms continue. • Early treatment of eating disorders leads to the best outcomes. • If you're worried about a loved one, urge your loved one to talk to a healthcare professional. • If you're a parent or caregiver who is concerned about your child's eating habits, weight or body image, share your concerns with your child's healthcare professional. • If you think you have an eating disorder, get help. • If you're thinking about suicide, contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • The causes of anorexia nervosa aren't known. • As with many diseases, it's probably a mix of factors: Genetics. • Although it isn't yet clear which genes are involved, genetic changes may make you more likely to develop anorexia. • That involves having genetic traits that include feeling the need to be perfect or being very sensitive. • Mental health. • People with eating disorders sometimes have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to strict diets and not eat, even though they're hungry. • They also may try to be perfect in everything they do. • Environmental. • Modern Western culture puts a lot of focus on being thin. • Social media plays a big role. • Peer pressure may cause you to want to be thin, lean or muscular. • A constant push to eat a healthy diet could lead to very strict eating habits. • These habits could turn into eating disorders. • Anorexia nervosa affects all gender identities, races, ages, incomes and body types. • Anorexia also is more common among teenagers, although people of any age can develop this eating disorder. • Teens may be more at risk because of all the changes their bodies go through during puberty. • They also may face more peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual comments about weight or body shape. • Certain factors raise the risk of anorexia and other eating disorders, including: Family history. • If you have a first-degree relative — a parent, sibling or child — who had anorexia, you have a higher risk of developing it. • A history of weight bullying. • People who have been teased or bullied about their weight are more likely to develop eating disorders. • This includes people with peers, family members, coaches and others who have shamed them for their weight. • A history of dieting. • Dieting behaviors raise the risk of an eating disorder. • People who are always dieting and whose weight is always going up and down as they get on and off new diets could develop an eating disorder. • Transitions. • Major changes can bring emotional stress and raise the risk of anorexia. • Such changes include a new school, home or job, as well as a relationship breakup or the death or illness of a loved one. • Anorexia nervosa can have many complications. • At its most severe, it can be fatal. • Death may happen suddenly — even if you aren't visibly underweight. • Irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias, can lead to death. • Also, an imbalance of electrolytes — minerals such as sodium, potassium and calcium that maintain the balance of fluids in the body — also can lead to death. • Other complications of anorexia include: Anemia. • Other heart conditions, such as mitral valve prolapse or heart failure. • Mitral valve prolapse happens when the valve between the heart's upper and lower left chambers doesn't close properly. • Bone loss, also known as osteoporosis, which can raise the risk of fractures. • Loss of muscle. • Stomach problems, such as constipation, bloating or nausea. • Kidney problems. • In females, anorexia can lead to having no period. • In males, it can decrease testosterone. • If you become severely malnourished, every organ system in your body can be damaged. • This damage may not be fully reversible, even when the anorexia is under control. • In addition to physical complications, you also may have other mental health symptoms and conditions, including: Depression and other mood disorders. • Anxiety. • Personality disorders. • Obsessive-compulsive disorders. • Alcohol and substance misuse. • Self-injury, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide. • There's no guaranteed way to prevent anorexia nervosa. • Primary healthcare professionals, including pediatricians, family medicine professionals and internal medicine professionals, may be in a good position to see early signs that could lead to anorexia. • For instance, they can ask questions about eating habits and satisfaction with appearance during routine medical appointments. • This could open a discussion about how this relates to health and where to get help if needed. • If you notice that people have dieting habits that seem too rigid, or they're unhappy with their appearance, think about talking to them about these issues. • Although you may not be able to prevent an eating disorder from starting, you can talk about your concerns and offer to assist them in finding help if needed. • Examples of organizations that offer support for caregivers, friends and family members of people with eating disorders include the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment for Eating Disorders (F.E.A.S.T.).",

      "Symptoms": "An orgasm is a peak feeling of intense pleasure in response to stimulating sexual activity. • Vaginal penetration during sex indirectly stimulates the clitoris. • But this may not be enough stimulation for orgasm. • Many women may also need direct manual or oral stimulation of the clitoris to reach orgasm. • Anorgasmia, or female orgasmic disorder, is defined as experiencing any of these in a significant way: Delayed orgasm. • Absence of orgasm. • Fewer orgasms. • Less-intense orgasms. • Anorgasmia can also be: Lifelong, if you've never had an orgasm. • Acquired, if you have new problems with having orgasms. • Situational, if you have problems with orgasm only in certain situations, with certain kinds of stimulation or with certain partners. • Generalized, if you have problems with orgasm in any situation. • Women who don't always reach orgasm during sexual encounters may not find it distressing. • In that case, the lack of an orgasm is not considered a disorder. • Talk to your healthcare professional if you have concerns about your sex life, especially if you're concerned about your ability to have an orgasm. • Sexual arousal and orgasms are complex reactions to various physical, emotional, sensory and psychological factors. • Difficulties in any of these areas can affect your ability to have an orgasm. • Past experiences, behaviors, background or mental well-being may contribute to problems with orgasms. • These include: Past sexual or emotional abuse. • Lack of knowledge about sexual stimulation or interactions. • Poor body image. • Guilt or embarrassment about sex. • Cultural or religious beliefs about sex. • Stressors, such as financial problems or loss of a loved one. • Mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression. • Problems with your sex partner may be contributing factors to problems with orgasms. • These may include: Lack of emotional intimacy. • Unresolved conflicts. • Poor communication of sexual needs and preferences. • Infidelity or breach of trust. • Intimate partner violence. • Partner's sexual dysfunction, such a male partner with erectile dysfunction. • A wide range of illnesses, physical changes and medications can interfere with orgasms: Health conditions. • Long-term conditions — such as diabetes, overactive bladder or multiple sclerosis — may be contributing or complicating factors in orgasm disorders. • Gynecological treatments. • Tissue damage from gynecologic surgeries, such as hysterectomy or cancer surgery, may affect the ability to have an orgasm. • Medicines. • Many prescription and nonprescription medications can inhibit orgasm, including blood pressure medicines, antipsychotic medicines, antihistamines and antidepressants — particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). • Alcohol and smoking. • Alcohol suppresses the nervous system and may hamper the ability to have an orgasm. • Smoking can limit blood flow to your sexual organs, affecting your ability to have an orgasm. • Age-related changes to the body. • Changes to the body after menopause or later in life may contribute to various types of sexual dysfunction. • Women experiencing anorgasmia may have one or more related sexual problems. • These may contribute to or complicate the problem with having orgasms. • These conditions include: Problems with sexual arousal. • Little or no desire for sex. • Pain from sexual intercourse or other sexual stimulation. • Dryness of the vagina or vulva. • Involuntary tightening of the vagina, called vaginismus. • Risk factors linked to having trouble with orgasm include: Low education level. • Low income. • Poor health. • Depression and other mental health conditions. • History of trauma, such as sexual abuse.",

      "Overview": "Anterior vaginal prolapse, also known as a cystocele (SIS-toe-seel) or a prolapsed bladder, is when the bladder drops from its usual position in the pelvis and pushes on the wall of the vagina. • The organs of the pelvis — including the bladder, uterus and intestines — are typically held in place by the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor. • Anterior prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor becomes weak or if too much pressure is put on the pelvic floor. • This can happen over time, during vaginal childbirth or with chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting. • Anterior prolapse is treatable. • For a mild or moderate prolapse, nonsurgical treatment is often effective. • In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions.",
      "Symptoms": "In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. • When signs and symptoms occur, they may include: A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence) Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down. • A prolapsed bladder can be uncomfortable, but it is rarely painful. • It can make emptying your bladder difficult, which may lead to bladder infections. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have any signs or symptoms that bother you or impact your daily activities. • Your pelvic floor consists of muscles, ligaments and connective tissues that support your bladder and other pelvic organs. • The connections between your pelvic organs and ligaments can weaken over time, or as a result of trauma from childbirth or chronic straining. • When this happens, your bladder can slip down lower than usual and bulge into your vagina (anterior prolapse). • Causes of stress to the pelvic floor include: Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth Being overweight or obese Repeated heavy lifting Straining with bowel movements A chronic cough or bronchitis These factors may increase your risk of anterior prolapse: Pregnancy and childbirth. • Women who have had a vaginal or instrument-assisted delivery, multiple pregnancies, or whose infants had a high birth weight have a higher risk of anterior prolapse. • Aging. • Your risk of anterior prolapse increases as you age. • This is especially true after menopause, when your body's production of estrogen — which helps keep the pelvic floor strong — decreases. • Hysterectomy. • Having your uterus removed may contribute to weakness in your pelvic floor, but this is not always the case. • Genetics. • Some women are born with weaker connective tissues, making them more susceptible to anterior prolapse. • Obesity. • Women who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of anterior prolapse.",

      "Overview": "Antisocial personality disorder, sometimes called sociopathy, is a mental health condition in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong and ignores the rights and feelings of others. • People with antisocial personality disorder tend to purposely make others angry or upset and manipulate or treat others harshly or with cruel indifference. • They lack remorse or do not regret their behavior. • People with antisocial personality disorder often violate the law, becoming criminals. • They may lie, behave violently or impulsively, and have problems with drug and alcohol use. • They have difficulty consistently meeting responsibilities related to family, work or school.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of antisocial personality disorder include repeatedly: Ignoring right and wrong. • Telling lies to take advantage of others. • Not being sensitive to or respectful of others. • Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or pleasure. • Having a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated. • Having problems with the law, including criminal behavior. • Being hostile, aggressive, violent or threatening to others. • Feeling no guilt about harming others. • Doing dangerous things with no regard for the safety of self or others. • Being irresponsible and failing to fulfill work or financial responsibilities. • Adults with antisocial personality disorder usually show symptoms of conduct disorder before the age of 15. • Symptoms of conduct disorder include serious, ongoing behavior problems, such as: Aggression toward people and animals. • Destruction of property. • Lying and dishonesty. • Theft. • Serious violation of rules. • Antisocial personality disorder is considered a lifelong condition. • But in some people, certain symptoms ― particularly destructive and criminal behavior ― may decrease over time. • It's not clear whether this decrease is a result of the effect aging has on their mind and body, an increased awareness of the impact that antisocial behavior has had on their life, or other factors. • People with antisocial personality disorder are not likely to seek help on their own. • If you suspect that a friend or family member may have the condition, you might gently suggest that the person seek help from a mental health provider and offer to help them find one. • Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions and behaviors that makes everyone unique. • It's the way people view, understand and relate to the outside world, as well as how they see themselves. • Personality forms during childhood. • It's likely shaped by inherited genes as well as life situations and experiences. • The exact cause of antisocial personality disorder isn't known, but: Genes may make you vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder — and life situations, especially neglect and abuse, may trigger its development. • Changes in the way the brain functions may have resulted during brain development. • Certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing antisocial personality disorder, such as: Diagnosis of childhood conduct disorder. • Family history of antisocial personality disorder or other personality disorders or mental health conditions. • Experiencing abuse or neglect during childhood. • Unstable or violent family life during childhood. • Men are at greater risk of having antisocial personality disorder than women are. • Complications and problems resulting from antisocial personality disorder may include: Spouse abuse or child abuse or neglect. • Problems with alcohol or drugs. • Being in jail or prison. • Attempting suicide or trying to kill someone else. • Having other mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. • Financial, educational or social problems. • Dying early, usually because of violence. • There's no sure way to prevent antisocial personality disorder from developing in those at risk. • Because antisocial behavior is thought to have its roots in childhood, parents, teachers and pediatricians may be able to see early warning signs. • It may help to try to identify those most at risk, such as children who show signs of conduct disorder, and then offer early intervention.",

      "Overview": "Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. • However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. • Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). • These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. • You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. • Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. • Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. • You can have more than one anxiety disorder. • Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. • Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help.",
      "Symptoms": "Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. • Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. • Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. • The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. • It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. • Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). • You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). • These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. • Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. • This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. • Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. • Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. • Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. • Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. • Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. • Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. • See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. • See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. • It's easier to treat if you get help early. • The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. • Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. • Inherited traits also can be a factor. • For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. • In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. • If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem. • Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include: Heart disease Diabetes Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma Drug misuse or withdrawal Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome Rare tumors that produce certain fight-or-flight hormones Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications. • It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if: You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder: Trauma. • Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. • Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders. • Stress due to an illness. • Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future. • Stress buildup. • A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety — for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances. • Personality. • People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are. • Other mental health disorders. • People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder. • Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. • Anxiety disorders can run in families. • Drugs or alcohol. • Drug or alcohol use or misuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety. • Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. • It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as: Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders Substance misuse Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Digestive or bowel problems Headaches and chronic pain Social isolation Problems functioning at school or work Poor quality of life Suicide There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious: Get help early. • Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait. • Stay active. • Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. • Enjoy social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries. • Avoid alcohol or drug use. • Alcohol and drug use can cause or worsen anxiety. • If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. • If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you.",

      "Symptoms": "Some people with aortic valve disease may not notice symptoms for many years. • Symptoms of aortic valve disease may include: Chest pain or tightness. • Dizziness. • Fainting. • Fatigue after activity or having less ability to be active. • Irregular heartbeat. • Shortness of breath, particularly during vigorous activity or when lying down. • Not eating enough. • This is mainly seen in children with aortic valve stenosis. • Not gaining enough weight. • This is mainly seen in children with aortic valve stenosis. • If you're having sudden chest pain, call 911 or your local emergency number. • Make an appointment for a health checkup if you have symptoms of aortic valve disease, such as shortness of breath, fatigue after activity, or sensations of a pounding or an irregular heartbeat. • Sometimes the first symptoms of aortic valve disease are related to heart failure. • Get a health checkup if you have fatigue that doesn't get better with rest, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet, which are common symptoms of heart failure.",
      "Causes": "Aortic valve disease may be caused by a heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Other causes of aortic valve disease later in life include: Age-related changes to the heart. • Infections. • High blood pressure. • Injury to the heart. • To better understand the causes of aortic valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart valves typically work. • The heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction. • These valves are: Aortic valve. • Mitral valve. • Tricuspid valve. • Pulmonary valve. • Each valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • In aortic valve disease, the valve between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery doesn't work properly. • The lower left heart chamber is called the left ventricle. • The body's main artery is called the aorta. • The valve may become thick and stiff or the valve may not close properly.",
      "Risk factors": "Many things can raise the risk of aortic valve disease, including: Older age. • Calcium can build up on the aortic valve as people age, causing the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. • Heart valve problems present at birth, called congenital heart defects. • Some people are born with a missing, extra or fused valve flap. • This increases the risk of aortic valve regurgitation. • Rheumatic fever. • This complication of strep throat can cause aortic stenosis, a type of heart valve disease. • If you have heart valve disease due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease. • If not, it's called nonrheumatic heart disease. • Inflammation of the lining of the heart's chambers and valves, called endocarditis. • This life-threatening condition is usually caused by infection. • It can damage the aortic valve. • History of radiation therapy to the chest. • Some types of cancer are treated with radiation therapy. • Symptoms of heart valve disease may not be noticed until many years after radiation therapy is received. • Other health conditions. • Chronic kidney disease, lupus and Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease, can increase the risk of aortic stenosis or regurgitation.",

      "Symptoms": "Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops over time. • You may have no symptoms for years. • You might not realize that you have the condition. • But sometimes, aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly. • Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve. • As aortic valve regurgitation becomes worse, symptoms may include: Shortness of breath with exercise or when lying down. • Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual. • Irregular heartbeat. • Lightheadedness or fainting. • Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise. • Sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. • Swollen ankles and feet. • Call a member of your health care team right away if you have symptoms of aortic valve regurgitation. • Sometimes the first symptoms of aortic valve regurgitation are related to heart failure. • Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump blood as well as it should. • Make an appointment with your health care team if you have: Tiredness, also called fatigue, that doesn't get better with rest. • Shortness of breath. • Swollen ankles and feet. • These are common symptoms of heart failure.",
      "Causes": "The aortic valve is one of four valves that control blood flow through the heart. • It separates the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The aortic valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • In aortic valve regurgitation, the valve doesn't close properly. • This causes blood to leak back into the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. • As a result, the chamber holds more blood. • This could cause it to get larger and thicken. • At first, the larger left ventricle helps maintain good blood flow with more force. • But eventually, the heart becomes weak. • Any condition that damages the aortic valve can cause aortic valve regurgitation. • Causes may include: Heart valve disease present at birth. • Some people are born with an aortic valve that has only two cusps, called a bicuspid valve. • Others are born with connected cusps rather than the typical three separate ones. • Sometimes the valve may have only one cusp, called a unicuspid valve. • Other times, there are four cusps, called a quadricuspid valve. • Having a parent or sibling with a bicuspid valve raises your risk of the condition. • But you can have a bicuspid valve even if you don't have a family history of the condition. • Narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis. • Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age. • The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. • It prevents the valve from opening properly. • Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly. • Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. • This life-threatening condition also is called endocarditis. • It's usually caused by an infection. • It can damage the aortic valve. • Rheumatic fever. • This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States. • Strep throat can cause it. • Rheumatic fever can cause the aortic valve to become stiff and narrow, in turn causing blood to leak. • If you have an irregular heart valve due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease. • Other health conditions. • Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve. • These include a connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. • Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation. • Tear or injury of the body's main artery. • The body's main artery is the aorta. • A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation. • So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.",
      "Risk factors": "Things that raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation include: Older age. • Heart problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects. • History of infections that can affect the heart. • Certain conditions passed down through families that can affect the heart, such as Marfan syndrome. • Other types of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve stenosis. • High blood pressure. • The condition also can happen without any known risk factors.",
      "Complications": "Complications of aortic valve regurgitation can include: Fainting or feeling lightheaded. • Heart failure. • Certain heart infections such as endocarditis. • Heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias. • Death.",
      "Prevention": "If you have any type of heart disease, get regular health checkups. • If you have a parent, child or sibling with a bicuspid aortic valve, you should have an imaging test called an echocardiogram. • This can check for aortic valve regurgitation. • Early diagnosis of heart valve disease, such as aortic valve regurgitation, is important. • Doing so may make the condition easier to treat. • Also, take steps to prevent conditions that can raise the risk of aortic valve regurgitation. • For example: Get a health checkup if you have a severe sore throat. • Untreated strep throat can lead to rheumatic fever. • Strep throat is treated with medicines that fight bacteria, called antibiotics. • Check your blood pressure regularly. • Have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. • Some people need more-frequent checks."

      "Overview": "Aortic valve stenosis is a type of heart valve disease, also called valvular heart disease. • The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the body's main artery, called the aorta. • In aortic valve stenosis, the valve is narrowed and doesn't open fully. • This reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart to the aorta and to the rest of the body. • Treatment of aortic stenosis depends on how severe the condition is. • Treatment may include surgery to fix or replace the valve. • Without treatment, severe aortic valve stenosis can lead to life-threatening complications.",
      "Symptoms": "Aortic valve stenosis ranges from mild to severe. • Symptoms generally happen when the valve is very narrowed. • Some people with aortic valve stenosis may not have symptoms for many years. • Symptoms of aortic valve stenosis may include: Chest pain or tightness with activity. • Feeling faint or dizzy or fainting with activity. • Shortness of breath, especially with activity. • Fatigue, especially during times of increased activity. • Rapid, fluttering heartbeat. • Children with aortic valve stenosis may have other symptoms such as: Not eating enough. • Not gaining enough weight. • Aortic valve stenosis may lead to heart failure. • Heart failure symptoms include extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet. • If you have an irregular heartbeat or other symptoms of aortic valve stenosis, make an appointment with your healthcare professional. • To understand the causes of aortic valve stenosis, it may help to know how the heart and heart valves typically work. • The heart has four valves that keep blood flowing in the correct way: Aortic valve. • Mitral valve. • Tricuspid valve. • Pulmonary valve. • Each valve has flaps, also called cusps, that open and close once during each heartbeat. • Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly. • If a valve doesn't fully open or close, blood flow is reduced or blocked. • In aortic valve stenosis, the valve between the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle, and the body's main artery, called the aorta, is narrowed and doesn't open completely. • This narrowing is called stenosis. • When the aortic valve opening is narrowed, the heart must work harder to pump enough blood to the body. • The extra work can cause the lower left heart chamber to get thick. • Eventually the heart may become weak. • Aortic valve stenosis causes include: Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Some children are born with an aortic valve that has only two cusps instead of the usual three. • If there are only two cusps, it's called a bicuspid aortic valve. • Rarely, an aortic valve may have one or four cusps. • Calcium buildup on the valve, called aortic valve calcification. • Calcium is a mineral found in the blood. • As blood moves over the aortic valve, calcium can collect on the valve. • The calcium deposits may never cause any problems. • Aortic valve stenosis that's related to increasing age and calcium deposit buildup usually doesn't cause symptoms until age 70 or 80. • But in some people — particularly those with changes in the aortic valve at birth — calcium deposits might cause the valve to narrow at a younger age. • Rheumatic fever. • This complication of untreated strep throat can damage the heart valves. • It may cause scar tissue to form on the aortic valve. • Scar tissue can narrow the aortic valve opening. • It also may make a rough surface on which calcium deposits can collect. • Risk factors of aortic valve stenosis include: Older age. • Some heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects. • An example is a bicuspid aortic valve. • Long-term kidney disease. • Heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. • Infections that can affect the heart, such as rheumatic fever and infective endocarditis. • Radiation therapy to the chest. • Possible complications of aortic valve stenosis are: Heart failure. • Stroke. • Blood clots. • Bleeding. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Infections that affect the heart, such as endocarditis. • Some possible ways to prevent aortic valve stenosis are: Get a health checkup when you have a sore throat. • Strep throat that is not treated can lead to rheumatic fever, which can damage heart valves. • Strep throat can usually be easily treated with antibiotics. • Rheumatic fever is more common in children and young adults. • Keep the heart healthy. • Talk about your risk factors for heart disease with your healthcare team. • Ask how to prevent and manage them. • Risk factors such as high blood pressure, obesity and high cholesterol may be linked to aortic valve stenosis. • Take care of the teeth and gums. • There may be a link between infected gums, called gingivitis, and a heart infection known as endocarditis. • Endocarditis is a risk factor for aortic valve stenosis.",

      "Overview": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix. • The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch that sticks out from the colon on the lower right side of the belly, also called the abdomen. • Appendicitis causes pain in the lower right part of the belly. • However, in most people, pain begins around the belly button and then moves. • As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes serious. • Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it happens in people between the ages of 10 and 30. • Treatment of appendicitis is usually antibiotics and, in most instances, surgery to remove the appendix.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of appendicitis may include: Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower belly. • Sudden pain that begins around the belly button and often shifts to the lower right belly. • Pain that worsens with coughing, walking or making other jarring movements. • Nausea and vomiting. • Loss of appetite. • Low-grade fever that may rise as the illness worsens. • Constipation or diarrhea. • Belly bloating. • Gas. • The site of the pain may vary, depending on age and the position of the appendix. • In pregnancy, the pain may seem to come from the upper belly because the appendix is higher during pregnancy. • Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you or your child has symptoms. • Terrible belly pain requires immediate medical attention. • A blockage in the lining of the appendix, called the lumen, is the likely cause of appendicitis. • This blockage can cause an infection. • The bacteria then multiply quickly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. • If not treated right away, the appendix may burst or break open. • Risk factors for appendicitis include: Age. • Anyone can develop appendicitis, but it most often happens in people between the ages of 10 and 30. • Your sex. • Men have a slightly higher risk of appendicitis than do women. • Appendicitis may cause serious complications, such as: A burst appendix. • A burst appendix, also called ruptured appendix, spreads infection throughout the abdomen, a condition called peritonitis. • Possibly life-threatening, this condition requires immediate surgery to remove the appendix and clean the abdominal cavity. • A pocket of pus that forms in the abdomen. • If the appendix bursts, a pocket of infection may develop. • This is called an abscess. • In most cases, a surgeon drains the abscess by placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the abscess. • The tube is left in place for about two weeks, and antibiotics are prescribed to clear the infection. • Once the infection is clear, the appendix can be removed surgically. • In some people, the abscess is drained, and the appendix is removed immediately.",

      "Overview": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when lung swelling causes fluid to build up in the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs. • These air sacs, called alveoli, have a protective membrane, but lung swelling damages that membrane. • The fluid leaking into the air sacs keeps the lungs from filling with enough air. • This means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, so the body's organs don't get the oxygen they need to work properly. • ARDS usually occurs in people who are already critically ill or have major injuries. • People usually are severely short of breath — the main symptom of ARDS — within a few hours to a few days after the injury or infection that caused ARDS. • Many people who get ARDS don't survive. • The risk of death gets higher with age and how severe the illness is. • Of the people who survive ARDS, some fully recover. • But others have lasting lung damage.",
      "Symptoms": "The seriousness of ARDS symptoms can vary depending on what's causing them and whether there is underlying heart or lung disease. • Symptoms include: Severe shortness of breath. • Labored and rapid breathing that is not usual. • Cough. • Chest discomfort. • Fast heart rate. • Confusion and extreme tiredness. • ARDS usually follows a major illness or injury, and most people who have ARDS are already in a hospital. • But if you have symptoms of ARDS and are not in a medical facility, go to the nearest emergency department right away or call 911 or your local emergency number for help.",
      "Causes": "Causes of ARDS include: Sepsis. • The most common cause of ARDS is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream. • Severe pneumonia. • Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs. • Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • People who have severe COVID-19 may get ARDS. • Because COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, it can cause lung injury and swelling that can lead to COVID-19-related ARDS. • Head, chest or other major injury. • Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing. • Breathing in harmful substances. • Breathing in a lot of smoke or chemical fumes can lead to ARDS, as can breathing in vomit. • Breathing in water in cases of near-drownings also can cause ARDS. • Other conditions and treatments. • Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis), massive blood transfusions and severe burns can lead to ARDS.",
      "Risk factors": "Most people who get ARDS already are in a hospital for another condition. • Many are critically ill. • People are especially at risk if they have an infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia. • They're also at higher risk if they have COVID-19, especially if they also have metabolic syndrome. • People who have alcohol use disorder or who use recreational drugs or smoke ― lifestyle habits that can harm the lungs ― are at higher risk of getting ARDS. • Having a history of alcohol, drug or tobacco use also raises the risk of ARDS.",
      "Complications": "ARDS can cause other medical problems while in the hospital, including: Blood clots. • Lying still in the hospital while you're on a ventilator can make it more likely that you'll get blood clots, particularly in the deep veins in your legs. • If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs, where it can block blood flow. • This is called a pulmonary embolism. • Collapsed lung, also called pneumothorax. • In most people with ARDS, a breathing machine called a ventilator brings more oxygen into the body and forces fluid out of the lungs. • But the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse. • Infections. • A ventilator attaches to a tube inserted in your windpipe. • This makes it much easier for germs to infect and injure your lungs. • Scarred and damaged lungs, known as pulmonary fibrosis. • Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs in the lungs can occur within a few weeks of the start of ARDS. • This makes your lungs stiffer, and it's even harder for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream. • Stress ulcers. • Extra acid that your stomach makes because of serious illness or injury can irritate the stomach lining and lead to ulcers. • Thanks to better treatments, more people are surviving ARDS. • But many survivors end up with potentially serious and sometimes lasting effects: Breathing problems. • After having ARDS, many people get most of their lung function back within several months to several years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. • Even people who do well usually have shortness of breath and fatigue and may need extra oxygen at home for a few months. • Depression. • Most ARDS survivors also report going through a period of depression, which can be treated. • Problems with memory and thinking clearly. • Sedatives and low levels of oxygen in the blood can lead to memory loss and learning problems after ARDS. • In some people, the effects may get better over time. • But in others, the damage may last for the rest of their lives. • Tiredness and muscle weakness. • Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken. • You also may feel very tired after treatment."

      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, can vary. • Sometimes an AVM doesn't cause symptoms. • The AVM can be found while getting images for another health concern. • Often the first symptoms appear after bleeding occurs. • Besides bleeding, symptoms can include: Trouble with thinking that gets worse over time. • Headaches. • Nausea and vomiting. • Seizures. • Loss of consciousness. • Other possible symptoms include: Weak muscles, such as weakness in the legs. • Loss of movement and feeling in one part of the body, known as paralysis. • Loss of coordination that can cause trouble with walking. • Trouble doing tasks that require planning. • Back pain. • Dizziness. • Vision problems. • This may include losing part of the field of vision, trouble moving the eyes or swelling of part of the optic nerve. • Trouble with speech or understanding language. • Numbness, tingling or sudden pain. • Memory loss or dementia. • Seeing or hearing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. • Confusion. • Children and teens might have trouble with learning or behavior. • One type of AVM called a vein of Galen malformation causes symptoms that appear at or shortly after birth. • A vein of Galen malformation occurs deep inside the brain. • Signs can include: A buildup of fluid in the brain that causes the head to be larger than usual. • Swollen veins on the scalp. • Seizures. • Failure to thrive. • Congestive heart failure. • Seek medical attention if you have any of the symptoms of an AVM, such as headaches, dizziness, vision problems, seizures and changes in thinking. • Many AVMs are found during testing for a different condition, such as during a CT scan or an MRI.",
      "Causes": "An arteriovenous malformation happens when arteries and veins connect in an irregular way. • Experts don't understand why this happens. • Certain genetic changes might play a role, but most types are not usually passed down in families.",
      "Risk factors": "Rarely, having a family history of an arteriovenous malformation can increase your risk. • But most types aren't inherited. • Certain hereditary conditions can increase your risk of an arteriovenous malformation. • These include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.",
      "Complications": "The most common complications of an arteriovenous malformation are bleeding and seizures. • Bleeding can cause brain damage and may cause death if you don't get treated."

      "Overview": "Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. • The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. • The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. • Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. • Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints. • Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. • Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis. • Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. • The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.",
      "Symptoms": "The most common signs and symptoms of arthritis involve the joints. • Depending on the type of arthritis, signs and symptoms may include: Pain Stiffness Swelling Redness Decreased range of motion The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways. • The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. • Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. • This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection. • Osteoarthritis also causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. • If cartilage in a joint is severely damaged, the joint lining may become inflamed and swollen. • In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. • This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. • The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint. • Risk factors for arthritis include: Family history. • Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder. • Age. • The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age. • Your sex. • Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men. • Previous joint injury. • People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint. • Obesity. • Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. • People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis. • Severe arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. • Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. • In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape.",

      "Overview": "Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. • This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. • For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. • For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. • Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. • Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.",
      "Symptoms": "Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. • You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. • Asthma signs and symptoms include: Shortness of breath Chest tightness or pain Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. • Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. • Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity See your doctor: If you think you have asthma. • If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. • Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time. • To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. • If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. • Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. • If your asthma symptoms get worse. • Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. • Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. • Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. • To review your treatment. • Asthma often changes over time. • Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments. • It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors. • Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. • Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Physical activity Cold air Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Strong emotions and stress Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. • They include: Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes Being overweight Being a smoker Exposure to secondhand smoke Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing Asthma complications include: Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma. • While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. • Follow your asthma action plan. • With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. • Then be sure to follow your plan. • Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. • Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life. • Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia. • Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. • Identify and avoid asthma triggers. • A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. • Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. • Monitor your breathing. • You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. • But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. • A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. • Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home. • Identify and treat attacks early. • If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. • You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. • When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. • Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. • If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan. • Take your medication as prescribed. • Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. • It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. • Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. • Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. • If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. • See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.",

      "Overview": "An asthma attack is a sudden worsening of asthma symptoms. • Asthma is a long-term condition that makes breathing difficult because airways in the lungs become narrow. • Symptoms of asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and difficulty getting enough air. • These symptoms happen because muscles around airways tighten up, the airways become irritated and swollen, and the lining of the airways produces a fluid called mucus. • All of these factors make it difficult to breathe. • People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan. • This tells them what medicines to take if they have an asthma attack and when to get emergency care. • People who do not have a diagnosis or don't have a treatment plan should get emergency care if they have these symptoms. • Frequent asthma attacks show that a person's asthma is not under control. • A healthcare professional might make changes in medicines and the asthma action plan to improve control. • An asthma attack also is called an asthma exacerbation or asthma flare-up.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of asthma attacks may include: Shortness of breath. • Chest tightness or pain. • Coughing. • Wheezing. • Severe symptoms also may include: Gasping for breath. • Difficulty speaking because of shortness of breath. • Straining of chest muscles to breathe. • Worse symptoms when lying on the back. • Severe sweating. • The result of an at-home test, called a peak flow meter, can be an important sign of an asthma attack. • This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. • Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. • This is called your personal best peak flow. • An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading. • A reading below 80% of a best peak flow can be a sign of an asthma attack. • An asthma action plan tells you when to call your healthcare professional and when to get emergency care. • A plan has three parts with color codes: Green. • The green zone of the plan is for times you are feeling well and have no asthma symptoms. • The plan tells you what dose of long-term control medicine to take every day. • It also tells you how many puffs of a quick-relief inhaler to take before you exercise. • If you use a peak flow meter, readings should be 80% or higher of your best. • Yellow. • The yellow zone tells you what to do if you have asthma symptoms. • It explains when to use a quick-relief inhaler and how many puffs to take. • It also describes what to do if your symptoms don't improve and when to call your care team. • Peak flow readings are 50% to 79% of your best. • Red. • The red zone tells you to get emergency care when symptoms are severe or if symptoms worsen or don't improve after using a quick-relief inhaler. • Peak flow readings are below 50% of your personal best. • If you do not have an asthma action plan, get emergency care if quick-relief medicine is not helping symptoms. • It's important to keep regular appointments with your healthcare professional. • If your asthma is under control, you may be able to take lower doses of medicine. • If you are using a rescue inhaler too often to treat asthma attacks, you may need changes to your asthma action plan. • These might include taking a new medicine or higher doses of a medicine.",
      "Causes": "Asthma is usually a lifelong disease of inflammation in the lungs caused by an overactive immune system. • Inflammation in the lungs includes the tightening of muscles around airways, swelling of tissues in the airways and the release of mucus that can block airways. • When this happens, it's difficult to breathe. • Asthma attacks occur when something triggers the immune system to take action. • Triggers may include: Allergic reaction to pollen, pets, mold, cockroaches and dust mites. • Colds, the flu or other illnesses affecting the nose, mouth and throat. • Tobacco smoke. • Cold, dry air. • Exercise. • A condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that results in stomach acids entering the tube between the mouth and stomach. • Pollution or irritating chemicals in the air. • Pain relievers, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and some other medicines. • Depression or anxiety.",
      "Risk factors": "Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack. • Factors that can increase the risk include: Poorly controlled allergies. • Exposure to triggers in the environment. • Not taking daily asthma medicines. • Incorrect use of inhaler. • Long-lasting depression or anxiety. • Other long-term illnesses, such as heart disease or diabetes.",
      "Complications": "Asthma attacks affect both a person's health and quality of life. • Problems may include: Missed days of school or work. • Frequent emergency or urgent care visits. • Interrupted sleep. • Limits on regular exercise or recreational activities. • Severe asthma attacks can cause death. • Life-threatening asthma attacks are more likely for people who frequently use quick-relief medicines, have had emergency room visits or hospital stays to treat asthma, or have other long-term illnesses.",
      "Prevention": "An important step to prevent an allergy attack is to follow your asthma action plan: Take your long-term asthma control medicine every day. • Take peak flow readings as directed. • Take your quick-relief medicine before exercise as directed. • Use quick-relief medicine as stated in your plan. • Keep track of how often you use quick-relief medicine. • Your input on how well the plan is working helps your healthcare professional adjust the treatment to prevent asthma attacks. • Other steps to prevent asthma attacks include the following: Avoid triggers as much as possible. • Stay indoors when there are poor air quality warnings. • Get tested for possible allergies and take allergy medicines as directed. • Wash your hands frequently to lower the risk of getting a cold or the flu. • Keep current on vaccinations, including annual flu and COVID-19 shots, and others recommended by your healthcare professional. • Get treatment for depression, anxiety or related conditions. • If you smoke, quit. • Wear a mask while cleaning. • Cover your mouth with a scarf or mask on cold days."

      "Overview": "Ataxia describes poor muscle control that causes clumsy movements. • It can affect walking and balance, hand coordination, speech and swallowing, and eye movements. • Ataxia usually results from damage to the part of the brain called the cerebellum or its connections. • The cerebellum controls muscle coordination. • Many conditions can cause ataxia, including genetic conditions, stroke, tumors, multiple sclerosis, degenerative diseases and alcohol misuse. • Certain medicines also can cause ataxia. • Treatment for ataxia depends on the cause. • Devices such as walkers and canes might help maintain independence. • These also are called adaptive devices. • Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and regular exercise also might help.",
      "Symptoms": "Ataxia symptoms can develop over time or start suddenly. • Ataxia can be a symptom of several nervous system conditions. • Symptoms may include: Poor coordination. • Walking unsteadily or with the feet set wide apart. • Poor balance. • Trouble with fine motor tasks such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt. • Changes in speech. • Back-and-forth eye movements that can't be controlled. • Trouble swallowing. • If you don't already have a condition that causes ataxia, such as multiple sclerosis, see your healthcare professional as soon as possible if you: Lose balance. • Lose muscle coordination in a hand, arm or leg. • Have trouble walking. • Slur your speech. • Have trouble swallowing.",
      "Causes": "Ataxia is caused by damage to the part of the brain called the cerebellum or its connections. • The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain and connects to the brainstem. • The cerebellum helps control balance, eye movements, swallowing and speech. • There are three major groups of ataxia causes: acquired, degenerative and hereditary. • Alcohol. • Long-term excess alcohol use may cause persistent ataxia. • Ataxia may improve by staying away from alcohol completely. • Medicines. • Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medicines. • It can be caused by sedatives such as phenobarbital and benzodiazepines. • It also may be caused by anti-seizure medicines, especially phenytoin. • Some types of chemotherapy also can cause ataxia. • Toxins. • Heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury, and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia. • Too little or too much of certain vitamins. • Ataxia may be caused by not getting enough vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-1, also known as thiamine. • Too little or too much vitamin B-6 also may cause ataxia. • Not getting enough of a certain vitamin is known as a vitamin deficiency. • When a vitamin deficiency is the cause of ataxia, it often can be reversed. • Thyroid conditions. • Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia. • Stroke. • Sudden onset of ataxia occurs with a stroke. • This may be either due to a blood vessel blockage or bleeding on the brain. • Multiple sclerosis. • This condition may cause ataxia. • Autoimmune diseases. • Several diseases in which the immune system attacks healthy cells, known as autoimmune diseases, can cause ataxia. • They can include a disease that causes inflammatory cells to collect in parts of the body, known as sarcoidosis. • Or they may include an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten, known as celiac disease. • Ataxia also can be caused by certain types of a condition that results in swelling in the brain and spinal cord, called encephalomyelitis. • Infections. • Rarely, ataxia may be a symptom of chickenpox in childhood and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. • It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. • The symptom usually gets better over time. • COVID-19. • Ataxia can result from a serious infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. • Paraneoplastic syndromes. • These are rare degenerative conditions triggered by an immune system response to a cancerous tumor, known as a neoplasm. • Paraneoplastic syndromes most often occur from lung, ovarian or breast cancer or lymphoma. • Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed. • Changes in the brain. • An infected area in the brain, known as an abscess, may cause ataxia. • And a growth on the brain, such as a cancerous or noncancerous tumor, can damage the cerebellum. • Head trauma. • Brain damage may cause ataxia. • Cerebral palsy. • This is a general term for a group of conditions caused by damage to a child's brain. • The damage may happen before, during or shortly after birth. • It affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements. • Multiple system atrophy. • This rare condition affects movements and functions such as blood pressure. • It can cause ataxia and other symptoms, including lack of bladder control, fainting after standing up and a sleep behavior condition in which a person acts out dreams. • Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are passed down in families. • These conditions also are called hereditary. • If you have one of these conditions, you may have been born with a genetic change that causes the body to make irregular proteins. • The irregular proteins affect the function of nerve cells, primarily in the cerebellum and spinal cord. • They cause the nerve cells to break down and die, known as degeneration. • As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. • People with a genetic ataxia may have inherited a dominant gene from one parent, known as an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. • Or they may have inherited a recessive gene from both parents, known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. • In a recessive condition, the parents are not affected but siblings may be affected. • Different gene changes cause different types of ataxia. • Most types get worse over time. • Each type causes poor coordination but also has other specific symptoms. • Spinocerebellar ataxias. • Researchers have identified more than 40 spinocerebellar ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. • Ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, and there may be other symptoms. • Episodic ataxia (EA). • There are eight recognized types of episodic ataxia. • The types EA1 and EA2 are the most common. • EA1 involves brief bouts of ataxia that may last seconds or minutes. • The bouts are triggered by stress, sudden movement or being startled. • They're often associated with muscle twitching. • EA2 involves longer bouts of ataxia, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours. • These bouts also are triggered by stress. • Dizziness and muscle weakness may occur. • People with EA2 may feel very tired. • Sometimes symptoms resolve later in life. • Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms may respond to medicine. • Friedreich ataxia. • This is the most common hereditary ataxia. • It involves damage to the cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. • Peripheral nerves carry signals from the arms and legs to the brain and spinal cord. • Symptoms typically appear well before age 25. • A brain scan usually doesn't show changes to the cerebellum with this type of ataxia. • The first symptom of Friedreich ataxia often is trouble walking. • The condition typically goes on to affect the arms and trunk. • This type of ataxia can cause changes to the feet, such as high arches. • It also can cause a curve of the spine, known as scoliosis. • Other symptoms that might develop include slurred speech, fatigue, irregular eye movements and hearing loss. • Friedreich ataxia also may lead to heart enlargement, known as cardiomyopathy. • Heart failure and diabetes also can occur. • Early treatment of heart conditions can improve quality of life and survival. • RFC1-associated ataxia. • This is the most common cause of ataxia that happens later in life. • The ataxia symptoms usually occur with dizziness and numbness or tingling in the body. • Sometimes this type of ataxia causes a cough. • Ataxia-telangiectasia. • This rare childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and immune system. • This increases the risk of other diseases, including infections and tumors. • Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red \"spider\" veins that might appear in the corners of a child's eyes or on the ears and cheeks. • Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are often the first symptoms. • Frequent sinus and respiratory infections are common. • Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. • Congenital cerebellar ataxia. • This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth. • Wilson's disease. • In people with this condition, copper builds up in the brain, liver and other organs. • This can cause ataxia and other symptoms.",
      "Risk factors": "There are several risk factors for ataxia. • People who have a family history of ataxia are at a higher risk of having ataxia themselves. • Other risk factors include: Drinking too much alcohol over a long period. • Having hypothyroidism or hypoparathyroidism. • Having multiple sclerosis. • Having an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten, known as celiac disease. • Having a disease that causes inflammatory cells to build up in parts of the body, known as sarcoidosis. • Having a degenerative disease called multiple system atrophy. • Having a paraneoplastic syndrome triggered by cancer. • Taking medicines that increase the risk of ataxia, such as anti-seizure medicines and sedatives. • Being exposed to heavy metals, such as lead or mercury, or solvents, such as from paint thinner. • Not getting enough vitamin E, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-1, also known as thiamine. • Getting too much vitamin B-6 also is a risk factor."

      "Overview": "Atelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) is the collapse of a lung or part of a lung, also known as a lobe. • It happens when tiny air sacs within the lung, called alveoli, lose air. • Atelectasis is one of the most common breathing complications after surgery. • It's also a possible complication of other respiratory problems, including cystic fibrosis, lung tumors, chest injuries, fluid in the lung and respiratory weakness. • You may develop atelectasis if you breathe in a foreign object. • This condition can make breathing hard, particularly if you already have lung disease. • Treatment depends on what's causing the collapse and how severe it is. • The definition of atelectasis is broader than pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks). • Pneumothorax is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing part or all of a lung to collapse. • Pneumothorax is one of several causes of atelectasis.",
      "Symptoms": "There may be no clear signs of atelectasis. • If you have any signs, they may include: Having a hard time breathing. • Rapid, weak breathing. • Wheezing. • Coughing. • Always get medical attention right away if you have a hard time breathing. • Other conditions besides atelectasis can make it hard to breathe, so it's important to get the right diagnosis and treatment. • If your breathing suddenly becomes difficult, get emergency medical help. • A blocked airway can cause atelectasis. • This is called obstructive atelectasis. • Pressure from outside the lung also can cause atelectasis. • This is called nonobstructive atelectasis. • General anesthesia — which brings on a sleeplike state with the use of medicines before a procedure or surgery — is a common cause of atelectasis. • It changes your regular pattern of breathing and affects the exchange of lung gases. • This can cause the air sacs in your lungs to lose air. • Nearly everyone who has major surgery has some amount of atelectasis. • It often occurs after heart bypass surgery. • When a blocked airway causes atelectasis, it may be due to: Mucus plug. • A mucus plug is a buildup of sputum or phlegm in your airways. • It commonly occurs during and after surgery because you can't cough. • Drugs given during surgery make you breathe less deeply. • So mucus that usually would move out of your lungs may build up in your airways. • Suctioning the lungs during surgery helps clear them. • But sometimes mucus still builds up. • Mucus plugs also are common in children, people with cystic fibrosis and during severe asthma attacks. • Foreign body. • Atelectasis is common in children who have inhaled an object into their lungs, such as a peanut or part of a small toy. • Tumor inside the airway. • A growth, which may or may not be cancer, can narrow or block the airway. • Possible causes of atelectasis due to pressure from outside the lung include: Injury. • Chest trauma, such as from a fall or car accident, can cause you to avoid taking deep breaths due to pain. • This can lead to the squeezing of your lungs. • Pleural effusion. • This condition involves the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of your lungs and the inside of your chest wall. • Pneumonia. • Various types of pneumonia, which is a lung infection, can cause atelectasis. • Pneumothorax. • This is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing some or all of a lung to collapse. • Scarring of lung tissue. • Injury, lung disease or surgery could cause scarring. • Tumor. • A large tumor can press against the lung and force air out of it. • Factors that make you more likely to get atelectasis include: Any condition that makes it hard to swallow. • Needing to stay in bed over a long time and not having enough changes of position. • Lung disease, such as asthma, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. • Recent surgery in the stomach area or chest. • Recent general anesthesia. • Weak breathing muscles due to muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury or another neuromuscular condition. • Medicines that may cause weak breathing. • Pain or injury that may make it painful to cough or cause weak breathing, including stomach pain or a broken rib. • Smoking. • A small area of atelectasis, especially in adults, usually can be treated. • These complications may come from atelectasis: Low blood oxygen (hypoxemia). • Atelectasis makes it harder for your lungs to get oxygen to the air sacs. • Pneumonia. • Your risk of pneumonia continues until the atelectasis goes away. • Mucus in a collapsed lung may lead to infection. • Respiratory failure. • Loss of a lobe or a whole lung, especially in an infant or someone with lung disease, can be life-threatening. • Atelectasis in children is often caused by a blockage in the airway. • To lower the risk of atelectasis, keep small objects out of the reach of children. • In adults, atelectasis most commonly occurs after major surgery. • If you're scheduled for surgery, talk with your doctor about ways to lower your risk. • Some research shows that certain breathing exercises and muscle training may lower the risk of atelectasis after some surgeries.",

      "Overview": "Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. • It's common in young children but can occur at any age. • Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. • It can be irritating but it's not contagious. • People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma. • Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). • Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.",
      "Symptoms": "Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. • They may include: Dry, cracked skin Itchiness (pruritus) Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin Oozing and crusting Thickened skin Darkening of the skin around the eyes Raw, sensitive skin from scratching Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. • For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years. • Talk with a health care provider if you or your child: Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities Has a skin infection — look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected. • In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. • With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors — such as tobacco smoke. • In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. • This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function. • A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms. • Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. • Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). • Dermatitis isn't contagious. • The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. • Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk. • Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include: Asthma and hay fever. • Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. • This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis. • Food allergies. • People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. • One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria). • Chronic itchy, scaly skin. • A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. • You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. • Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. • Over time, you may scratch out of habit. • This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery. • Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area. • This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. • It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. • It might take several months for the discoloration to fade. • Skin infections. • Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. • These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. • These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening. • Irritant hand dermatitis. • This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work. • Allergic contact dermatitis. • This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. • Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. • The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color. • Sleep problems. • The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep. • Mental health conditions. • Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. • This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis. • Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. • The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing: Moisturize your skin at least twice a day. • Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. • Choose a product or products that work well for you. • Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented. • Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis. • Take a daily bath or shower. • Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes. • Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. • Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. • For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean — no soap or bubble bath needed. • Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. • For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. • Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah. • Pat dry. • After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. • Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes). • The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. • Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. • In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare. • Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include: Rough wool fabric Dry skin Skin infection Heat and sweat Stress Cleaning products Dust mites and pet dander Mold Pollen Smoke from tobacco Cold and dry air Fragrances Other irritating chemicals Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. • Talk with your child's health care provider about

      "Overview": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. • An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. • AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. • The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. • During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. • They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. • But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. • Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. • AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. • But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. • Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. • A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. • The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of AFib may include: Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. • Chest pain. • Dizziness. • Fatigue. • Lightheadedness. • Reduced ability to exercise. • Shortness of breath. • Weakness. • Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms. • Atrial fibrillation may be: Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. • AFib symptoms come and go. • The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. • Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. • The episodes can happen repeatedly. • Symptoms might go away on their own. • Some people with occasional AFib need treatment. • Persistent. • The irregular heartbeat is constant. • The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. • If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm. • Long-standing persistent. • This type of AFib is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. • Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat. • Permanent. • In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. • Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots. • If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. • You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. • If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. • Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack. • To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. • The heart has four chambers: The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. • The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat. • The signals move across the upper heart chambers. • Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. • The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. • In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. • The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute. • But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. • As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. • The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. • This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm. • In people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. • Problems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Heart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include: A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect. • A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Heart attack. • Heart valve disease. • High blood pressure. • Lung diseases, including pneumonia. • Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease. • Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid. • Infections from viruses. • Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib. • Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage. • Lifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include: Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine. • Illegal drug use. • Smoking or using tobacco. • Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription. • Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include: Age. • The risk of AFib increases as you grow older. • Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. • Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. • Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. • Drinking too much alcohol. • Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. • This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. • Changes in the level of body minerals. • Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. • If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur. • Family history. • An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families. • Heart problems or heart surgery. • Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of AFib. • A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition. • High blood pressure. • Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. • Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. • This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart. • Obesity. • People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation. • Other long-term health conditions. • You may be more likely to get AFib if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea. • Some medicines and supplements. • Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats. • Thyroid disease. • Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats. • Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Blood clots can lead to stroke. • The risk of stroke from AFib increases as you grow older. • Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due to AFib. • These conditions include: High blood pressure. • Diabetes. • Heart failure. • Some types of heart valve disease. • Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. • Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Here are some basic heart-healthy tips: Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Don't smoke or use tobacco. • Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to. • Get good sleep. • Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress.",
      "Causes": "To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. • The heart has four chambers: The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. • The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat. • The signals move across the upper heart chambers. • Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. • The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. • In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. • The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute. • But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. • As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. • The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. • This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm. • In people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. • Problems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Heart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include: A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect. • A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome. • A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. • Heart attack. • Heart valve disease. • High blood pressure. • Lung diseases, including pneumonia. • Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease. • Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid. • Infections from viruses. • Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib. • Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage. • Lifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include: Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine. • Illegal drug use. • Smoking or using tobacco. • Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription.",

      "Overview": "Atrial flutter is a type of heart rhythm disorder, called an arrhythmia. • It is similar to atrial fibrillation (AFib). • But in atrial flutter the heart rhythm is more organized and less chaotic than in AFib. • A person can have both atrial flutter and AFib. • Atrial flutter may not cause symptoms. • But some people may have a pounding, rapid heartbeat and chest pain. • Fainting or almost fainting also may happen. • Treatment for atrial flutter may include medicines and a heart procedure.",
      "Symptoms": "People with atrial flutter may not have symptoms. • The irregular heartbeat may be found during a health checkup for another reason. • If atrial flutter symptoms happen, they may include: A pounding or racing feeling in the chest. • Chest pain. • Fainting or almost fainting. • Shortness of breath. • Feeling very tired. • If you feel like your heart is pounding, fluttering, skipping a beat or beating too fast, make an appointment for a health checkup. • You may be told to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. • Get emergency medical care if you have these symptoms: Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Fainting. • Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack.",
      "Causes": "Changes in the heart's electrical system cause atrial flutter. • The heart's electrical system controls the heartbeat. • Some health conditions or heart surgery can change how electrical signals travel through the heart and cause atrial flutter. • The movement of the heart's signals make the heart squeeze and pump blood. • Usually, this process goes smoothly. • The typical resting heart rate is about 60 to 100 beats a minute. • But in atrial flutter, the heart's upper chambers beat too quickly. • This causes the heart to beat in a fast, but usually organized, way.",
      "Risk factors": "Some health conditions increase the risk of atrial flutter. • They include: Heart failure. • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD. • Blood clot in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism. • Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. • Other risk factors for atrial flutter are: Getting older. • Recent heart surgery.",
      "Complications": "A complication of atrial flutter is atrial fibrillation (AFib). • About half of people with atrial flutter get AFib within three years. • AFib increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. • Other complications of atrial flutter are: Heart failure. • Stroke. • Heart attack.",
      "Prevention": "Lifestyle changes help keep the heart healthy. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Don't smoke. • Eat healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Eat less salt and saturated fats. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. • Keep a healthy weight. • Use less or do not use caffeine and alcohol. • Reduce and manage stress. • Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Get good sleep. • Adults should try to get 7 to 9 hours daily."

      "Overview": "An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart condition that you're born with. • That means it's a congenital heart defect. • People with an ASD have a hole between the upper heart chambers. • The hole increases the amount of blood going through the lungs. • Small atrial septal defects might be found by chance and never cause a concern. • Others might close during infancy or early childhood. • A large, long-term atrial septal defect can damage the heart and lungs. • Surgery may be needed to repair an atrial septal defect and to prevent complications. • Types of atrial septal defects (ASDs) include: Secundum. • This is the most common type of ASD. • It occurs in the middle of the wall between the upper heart chambers. • This wall is called the atrial septum. • Primum. • This type of ASD affects the lower part of the wall between the upper heart chambers. • It might occur with other heart problems present at birth. • Sinus venosus. • This is a rare type of ASD. • It most often happens in the upper part of the wall between the heart chambers. • It often occurs with other heart structure changes present at birth. • Coronary sinus. • The coronary sinus is part of the vein system of the heart. • In this rare type of ASD, part of the wall between the coronary sinus and the left upper heart chamber is missing.",
      "Symptoms": "A baby born with an atrial septal defect (ASD) may not have symptoms. • Symptoms may begin in adulthood. • Atrial septal defect symptoms may include: Shortness of breath, especially when exercising. • Tiredness, especially with activity. • Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area. • Irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. • Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations. • Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after a child is born. • Get immediate emergency help if a child has trouble breathing. • Call a healthcare professional if these symptoms occur: Shortness of breath, especially during exercise or activity. • Easy tiring, especially after activity. • Swelling of the legs, feet or belly area. • Skipped heartbeats or feelings of a quick, pounding heartbeat.",
      "Causes": "The cause of atrial septal defect is not clear. • The problem affects the structure of the heart. • It happens as the baby's heart is forming during pregnancy. • The following may play a role in the cause of congenital heart defects such as atrial septal defect: Changes in genes. • Some medical conditions. • Certain medicines. • Smoking. • Alcohol misuse. • To understand the cause of atrial septal defect, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works. • The typical heart is made of four chambers. • The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs. • In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns it to the heart's left side. • The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The blood then goes out to the rest of the body. • A large atrial septal defect can send extra blood to the lungs and cause the right side of the heart to work too hard. • Without treatment, the right side of the heart grows larger over time and becomes weak. • The blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs also can increase, causing pulmonary hypertension.",
      "Risk factors": "Atrial septal defect (ASD) occurs as the baby's heart is forming during pregnancy. • It is a congenital heart defect. • Things that may increase a baby's risk of atrial septal defect or other heart problems present at birth include: German measles, also called rubella, during the first few months of pregnancy. • Diabetes. • Lupus. • Alcohol or tobacco use during pregnancy. • Cocaine use during pregnancy. • Use of some medicines during pregnancy, including those to treat seizures and mood conditions. • Some types of congenital heart defects occur in families. • This means they are inherited. • Tell your care team if you or someone in your family had a heart problem present at birth. • Screening by a genetic counselor can help show the risk of certain heart defects in future children.",
      "Complications": "A small atrial septal defect might never cause any concern. • Small atrial septal defects often close during infancy. • Larger atrial septal defects can cause serious complications, including: Right-sided heart failure. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Stroke. • Early death. • High blood pressure in the lung arteries, called pulmonary hypertension. • Pulmonary hypertension can cause permanent lung damage. • This complication, called Eisenmenger syndrome, most often occurs over many years. • It sometimes happens in people with large atrial septal defects. • Treatment can prevent or help manage many of these complications. • If you have an atrial septal defect and are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, talk to a care professional first. • It's important to get proper prenatal care. • A healthcare professional may suggest repairing the hole in the heart before getting pregnant. • A large atrial septal defect or its complications can lead to a high-risk pregnancy.",
      "Prevention": "Because the cause of atrial septal defect (ASD) is not clear, prevention may not be possible. • But getting good prenatal care is important. • If you were born with an ASD, make an appointment for a health checkup before becoming pregnant. • During this visit: Talk about current health conditions and medicines. • It's important to closely control diabetes, lupus and other health conditions during pregnancy. • Your healthcare professional may suggest changing doses of some medicines or stopping them before pregnancy. • Review your family medical history. • If you have a family history of congenital heart defects or other genetic conditions, you might talk with a genetic counselor to find your risks. • Ask about getting tested to see if you've had German measles, also called rubella. • Rubella in a pregnant person has been linked to some types of congenital heart defects in the baby. • If you haven't already had German measles or the vaccine, get the recommended vaccinations."

      "Symptoms": "The main features of ADHD include not paying attention and being hyperactive and impulsive. • ADHD symptoms usually start before age 12. • In some children, they can be seen as early as 3 years of age. • ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. • Symptoms need to be seen in two or more settings, such as at home and at school. • The symptoms cause problems with development and daily life and may continue into adulthood. • ADHD occurs more often in boys than in girls. • Behaviors can be different in boys and girls. • For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to quietly not pay attention. • There are three types of ADHD: Predominately inattentive. • In this type, most symptoms fall under inattention. • This means having trouble focusing and staying on a task. • It also includes trouble getting and staying organized. • Predominately hyperactive and impulsive. • In this type, most symptoms involve being hyperactive and impulsive. • Hyperactive means being too active and having too much energy. • It may include disruptive behavior. • Being impulsive means acting without thinking ahead about the results or effects of behavior. • Combined. • This type is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. • The person meets the criteria for both predominately inattentive and predominately hyperactive and impulsive types of ADHD. • A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork. • Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play. • Seem not to listen, even when spoken to directly. • Have a hard time following through on instructions and not finish schoolwork or chores. • Have trouble organizing tasks and activities. • Stay away from or not like tasks that need focused mental effort, such as homework. • Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils. • Be easily distracted by other things, thoughts or activities rather than finishing a task. • Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores. • A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often: Fidget with or tap hands or feet, or squirm in the seat. • Have a hard time staying seated in the classroom or in other situations. • Be on the go, in constant motion. • Run around or climb in situations when it's not proper. • Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. • Talk too much. • Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner. • Have trouble waiting for a turn. • Interrupt others' conversations, games or activities. • Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. • It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and not be able to stick with one activity for long. • Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. • The same is true of hyperactivity. • Young children are naturally energetic. • They often are still full of energy long after they've tired their parents. • And some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. • Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. • Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends may likely have a concern other than ADHD. • The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home but whose schoolwork and friendships aren't affected. • If you're concerned that your child shows signs of ADHD, see your pediatrician or family healthcare professional. • Your healthcare professional can do a medical evaluation to check for other causes of your child's symptoms. • Then if needed, your child may be referred to a specialist, such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, psychiatrist or pediatric neurologist. • While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue. • Factors that may be involved in the development of ADHD include genetics, the environment or central nervous system conditions at key moments in development. • Risk factors for ADHD may include: Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with ADHD or another mental health condition. • Being around environmental toxins such as lead, which is found mainly in paint and pipes in older buildings. • Being born to a parent who used recreational drugs, alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy. • Being born too early, also called premature birth. • Although many people seem to believe that sugar causes hyperactivity, there's no proof of this. • Many issues in childhood can lead to trouble paying attention, but that's not the same as ADHD. • ADHD can make life hard for children. • Children with ADHD: Often have trouble in the classroom, which can lead to failing grades and being judged by other children and adults. • Tend to have more accidents and injuries of all kinds than do children who don't have ADHD. • Tend to have poor self-esteem. • Are more likely to have trouble interacting with and being accepted by peers and adults. • Are at higher risk of alcohol and drug misuse and other behavior that can cause problems with the law. • Have a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide. • Have sleep disorders. • ADHD does not cause other mental health or developmental problems. • But children with ADHD are more likely than others to also have conditions such as: Oppositional defiant disorder. • This condition is generally defined as a pattern of negative, defiant and hostile behavior toward people who are in authority. • Conduct disorder. • This involves antisocial behavior such as stealing, fighting, destroying property, and harming people or animals. • Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. • This involves irritability and problems handling frustration. • Learning disabilities. • These can include problems with reading, writing, understanding and communicating. • Substance use disorders. • This involves misuse of drugs, alcohol, marijuana or nicotine. • Anxiety. • This results in constant worry and nervousness that affect daily life. • Obsessive-compulsive disorder, also called OCD. • OCD is a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears that lead to repetitive behaviors. • These get in the way of daily activities and cause a lot of distress. • Mood disorders. • These include depression and bipolar disorder. • Bipolar disorder includes depression and manic behavior. • Autism spectrum disorder. • This condition is related to brain development. • It impacts how a person thinks of and socializes with others. • Tic disorders. • These conditions involve repetitive movements or unwanted sounds, called tics, that can't be easily controlled. • To help lower your child's risk of ADHD: During pregnancy, avoid anything that could harm your baby's development before birth. • For example, don't drink alcohol, use drugs or smoke cigarettes. • Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins, including cigarette smoke and lead paint. • Limit screen time. • Although still not proved, it may be a good idea for young children to limit TV, video games and other screen time.",

      "Complications": "ADHD can make life hard for children. • Children with ADHD: Often have trouble in the classroom, which can lead to failing grades and being judged by other children and adults. • Tend to have more accidents and injuries of all kinds than do children who don't have ADHD. • Tend to have poor self-esteem. • Are more likely to have trouble interacting with and being accepted by peers and adults. • Are at higher risk of alcohol and drug misuse and other behavior that can cause problems with the law. • Have a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide. • Have sleep disorders. • ADHD does not cause other mental health or developmental problems. • But children with ADHD are more likely than others to also have conditions such as: Oppositional defiant disorder. • This condition is generally defined as a pattern of negative, defiant and hostile behavior toward people who are in authority. • Conduct disorder. • This involves antisocial behavior such as stealing, fighting, destroying property, and harming people or animals. • Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. • This involves irritability and problems handling frustration. • Learning disabilities. • These can include problems with reading, writing, understanding and communicating. • Substance use disorders. • This involves misuse of drugs, alcohol, marijuana or nicotine. • Anxiety. • This results in constant worry and nervousness that affect daily life. • Obsessive-compulsive disorder, also called OCD. • OCD is a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears that lead to repetitive behaviors. • These get in the way of daily activities and cause a lot of distress. • Mood disorders. • These include depression and bipolar disorder. • Bipolar disorder includes depression and manic behavior. • Autism spectrum disorder. • This condition is related to brain development. • It impacts how a person thinks of and socializes with others. • Tic disorders. • These conditions involve repetitive movements or unwanted sounds, called tics, that can't be easily controlled.",
      "Prevention": "To help lower your child's risk of ADHD: During pregnancy, avoid anything that could harm your baby's development before birth. • For example, don't drink alcohol, use drugs or smoke cigarettes. • Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins, including cigarette smoke and lead paint. • Limit screen time. • Although still not proved, it may be a good idea for young children to limit TV, video games and other screen time."

      "Overview": "Atypical genitalia, formerly called ambiguous genitalia, is a rare condition in which an infant's genitals don't appear to be clearly male or female on the outside. • In a baby with atypical genitalia, the genitals may not be developed fully or may look different from what is expected. • Or the baby may have features of more than one sex. • The sex organs on the outside of the body may not match the sex organs on the inside. • And they may not match the genetic sex, which is determined by sex chromosomes: typically, XX for females and XY for males. • External genitals are the sex organs on the outside of the body. • They include the opening of the vagina and the labia, clitoris, penis and scrotum. • Internal genitals are the sex organs inside the body. • They include the vagina, fallopian tubes, uterus, prostate, ovaries and testicles. • Sex hormones are made by the ovaries and testicles, which also are called gonads. • Genetic sex is set based on sex chromosomes. • Typically, these sex chromosomes are a genetic female with two X chromosomes and a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome. • Atypical genitalia is not a disease; it's a difference of sex development. • Usually, atypical genitalia can be seen at or shortly after birth. • The condition can be very distressing for families. • Your medical team looks for the cause of atypical genitalia and provides information and counseling that can help guide decisions about your baby's sex and any needed treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born. • Sometimes, atypical genitalia may be suspected before birth. • Atypical genitalia can vary in appearance. • Differences may depend on when during genital development the hormone changes that affected development occurred and the cause. • Babies who are genetically female, which means they have two X chromosomes, may have: An enlarged clitoris, which may look like a penis. • Closed labia, or labia that include folds and look like a scrotum. • Lumps that feel like testicles in the fused labia. • Babies who are genetically male, which means they have one X and one Y chromosome, may have: A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen, called the urethra, doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis. • If the tube opening is on the underside of the penis, the condition is called hypospadias. • A very small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum. • One or both testicles missing in what appears to be the scrotum. • Testicles that remain in the body, also called undescended testicles, and an empty scrotum that has the appearance of labia with or without a micropenis.",
      "Causes": "Atypical genitalia usually happen when hormone changes during pregnancy stop or disturb an unborn baby's developing sex organs. • An unborn baby also is called a fetus. • A baby's genetic sex is set at conception, based on the sex chromosomes. • Conception is when the egg from one parent meets the sperm from the other parent. • The egg contains an X chromosome. • The sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome. • A baby who gets the X chromosome from the sperm is a genetic female with two X chromosomes. • A baby who gets the Y chromosome from the sperm is a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome. • Male and female sex organs develop from the same tissue. • Whether this tissue becomes male organs or female organs depends on the chromosomes and the presence or absence of hormones called androgens. • Androgens cause the development of male genitals. • In a fetus with a Y chromosome, a region on that chromosome triggers the development of testicles, which make androgens. • Male genitals develop in response to these hormones from the fetal testicles. • In a fetus without a Y chromosome, and without the effects of androgens, the genitals develop as female. • Sometimes a chromosomal change may make it hard to figure out the genetic sex. • A change in the steps that influence fetal sex development can result in a mismatch between the appearance of a baby's external genitals and the baby's internal sex organs or genetic sex, typically XX or XY. • If a genetic male fetus doesn't make hormones called androgens or doesn't have enough of these hormones, it can cause atypical genitalia. • Exposure to androgens during development in a genetic female fetus results in atypical external genitalia. • Changes in certain genes can affect fetal sex development and cause atypical genitalia. • Atypical genitalia also can be a feature of certain rare or complex syndromes that affect many organs. • These syndromes can include chromosome changes such as a missing sex chromosome or an extra one. • Sometimes it's not possible to find the cause of atypical genitalia. • Causes of atypical genitalia in genetic females may include: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. • Certain forms of this genetic condition cause the adrenal glands to make too much of hormones called androgens. • Exposure to certain hormones before birth. • Some drugs that contain androgens or that cause a pregnant person's body to make these hormones can cause developing female genitals to become more masculine. • A developing fetus also may be exposed to too much of the hormones that cause the development of male genitals if the pregnant person has a condition that causes hormones to be out of balance. • Tumors. • Rarely, a tumor in the pregnant person can make hormones that cause the development of male genitals. • Causes of atypical genitalia in genetic males may include: Problems with testicle development. • This may be due to changes in genes or due to unknown causes. • Androgen insensitivity syndrome. • In this condition, developing genital tissues don't respond as they should to hormones made by the testicles. • Problems with the testicles or testosterone. • A variety of problems can interfere with the testicles' activity. • These can include problems with how the testicles are formed and problems with making the hormone testosterone. • This also may include problems with certain proteins in cells that tell the cells to respond to testosterone. 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. • Not having enough of this enzyme causes problems with making hormones that cause the development of male genitals.",
      "Risk factors": "Family history may play a role in the development of atypical genitalia. • This is because many differences of sex development result from gene changes that can be passed down in families. • Possible risk factors for atypical genitalia include a family history of: Unexplained deaths in early infancy. • Infertility, not having menstrual periods or having a lot of facial hair in females. • Atypical genitalia. • Atypical physical development during puberty. • Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands and are passed down in families. • If your family has a history of these risk factors, talk with your healthcare professional before trying to get pregnant. • Genetic counseling also can help in planning ahead.",
      "Complications": "Complications of atypical genitalia may include: Infertility. • Whether people with atypical genitalia can have children depends on the specific diagnosis. • For example, genetic females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia usually can get pregnant if they so choose. • Higher risk of certain cancers. • Some differences of sex development are linked with a higher risk of certain types of cancer."

      "Overview": "Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is the development of precancerous cells in the breast. • Atypical hyperplasia causes a buildup of cells in the breast tissue. • When viewed with a microscope, the cells look different from typical breast cells. • Atypical hyperplasia of the breast isn't breast cancer. • But it's a sign that you have an increased risk of breast cancer in the future. • Your healthcare team creates a plan to help you manage your risk of breast cancer. • Often this includes more-frequent breast cancer screening tests. • You also might consider medicines to reduce breast cancer risk.",
      "Symptoms": "Atypical hyperplasia of the breast usually doesn't cause any symptoms. • Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is typically found during a breast biopsy. • A breast biopsy is a procedure to remove some breast cells for testing. • It's often recommended if something concerning is found on a mammogram or an ultrasound. • A biopsy also might be done to investigate a breast concern, such as a lump. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. • It's not clear what causes atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • Atypical hyperplasia of the breast happens when cells in the breast tissue develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The changes tell the cell to make many more cells. • This causes a buildup of cells in the breast. • Healthcare professionals call this buildup hyperplasia. • The changes also turn the cells into atypical cells. • This means that the cells look different from typical cells. • Atypical hyperplasia is thought to be a very early step in the process that turns healthy cells into cancer cells. • In theory, if atypical hyperplasia cells are allowed to continue growing, they could get more DNA changes and become cancer cells. • More research is needed to understand how this happens. • Atypical hyperplasia can happen in the breast ducts or the breast lobules: Atypical ductal hyperplasia describes a growth of atypical cells within the breast ducts. • The breast ducts are tubes that can carry breast milk to the nipple. • This type of atypical hyperplasia is most common. • Atypical lobular hyperplasia describes a growth of atypical cells within the breast lobules. • The breast lobules are glands that can make breast milk. • This type of atypical hyperplasia is less common. • Both types of atypical hyperplasia increase the risk of breast cancer. • Treatment for both types is similar. • There are no specific risk factors for atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • Atypical hyperplasia is one of several conditions that cause a growth of cells in the breast that isn't cancerous. • These conditions are sometimes called benign breast diseases. • Healthcare professionals have found risk factors for benign breast diseases. • They include: A family history of breast cancer. • If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of being diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast or another benign breast disease before menopause is increased. • Menopausal hormone therapy. • Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of atypical hyperplasia and other benign breast diseases. • If you've been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of getting breast cancer in the future. • The risk of breast cancer in those with atypical hyperplasia is about four times higher than in those who don't have atypical hyperplasia. • The risk is similar for atypical ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia. • Studies of women with atypical hyperplasia have found that the risk of breast cancer increases over time. • At 25 years after diagnosis, about 30% of women with atypical hyperplasia may have breast cancer. • Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 30 can be expected to have breast cancer 25 years after diagnosis. • And 70 will not develop breast cancer. • It's not clear whether there's anything that can prevent atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • The same things that help lower the risk of breast cancer may help lower the risk of atypical hyperplasia. • Things you can do to lower your risk of breast cancer include: Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. • Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. • Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. • You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. • If there is a new change, a lump or something not typical in your breasts, report it to a healthcare professional right away. • Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. • But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. • This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. • Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. • For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. • So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. • If you haven't been active lately, ask a healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. • Hormone therapy treatments used to ease menopause symptoms may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. • Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. • These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. • To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. • If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. • If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. • Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of

      "Overview": "Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. • The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. • The term \"spectrum\" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity. • Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate — autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. • Some people still use the term \"Asperger's syndrome,\" which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder. • Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society — socially, in school and at work, for example. • Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. • A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms. • While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children.",
      "Symptoms": "Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. • Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. • Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. • Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. • Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. • Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. • Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. • It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. • Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. • A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs: Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs: Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. • Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. • Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems. • Babies develop at their own pace, and many don't follow exact timelines found in some parenting books. • But children with autism spectrum disorder usually show some signs of delayed development before age 2 years. • If you're concerned about your child's development or you suspect that your child may have autism spectrum disorder, discuss your concerns with your doctor. • The symptoms associated with the disorder can also be linked with other developmental disorders. • Signs of autism spectrum disorder often appear early in development when there are obvious delays in language skills and social interactions. • Your doctor may recommend developmental tests to identify if your child has delays in cognitive, language and social skills, if your child: Doesn't respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months Doesn't mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months Doesn't babble or coo by 12 months Doesn't gesture — such as point or wave — by 14 months Doesn't say single words by 16 months Doesn't play \"make-believe\" or pretend by 18 months Doesn't say two-word phrases by 24 months Loses language skills or social skills at any age Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. • Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. • Both genetics and environment may play a role. • Genetics. • Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. • For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. • For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. • Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. • Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously. • Environmental factors. • Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder. • One of the greatest controversies in autism spectrum disorder centers on whether a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. • Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. • In fact, the original study that ignited the debate years ago has been retracted due to poor design and questionable research methods. • Avoiding childhood vaccinations can place your child and others in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), measles or mumps. • The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. • It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both. • Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. • These may include: Your child's sex. • Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are. • Family history. • Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. • It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder. • Other disorders. • Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. • Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use. • Extremely preterm babies. • Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder. • Parents' ages. • There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link. • Problems with social interactions, communication and behavior can lead to: Problems in school and with successful learning Employment problems Inability to live independently Social isolation Stress within the family Victimization and being bullied There's no way to prevent autism spectrum disorder,

      "Overview": "Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. • This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. • Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary but may include memory loss, changes in thinking, changes in behavior and seizures. • Autoimmune encephalitis is different from encephalitis caused by viral or bacterial infections, known as infectious encephalitis. • Infectious encephalitis isn't caused by an immune reaction, and it's treated with different medicines. • Research has found that the number of people with autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to the number of people with infectious encephalitis. • Experts don't know what causes autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE. • For some people, AE is triggered by certain cancers or infections. • Autoimmune encephalitis also may be triggered by medicines. • People with an autoimmune disease or a family history of autoimmune disease may be more likely to get AE. • Healthcare professionals use several tests to diagnose autoimmune encephalitis. • Without treatment, autoimmune encephalitis can cause serious complications, including death. • But treatments can lead to recovery. • Many people with AE make a full recovery, but some can have lasting symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can vary from person to person. • But symptoms can occur in a pattern that is predictable depending on the type of autoimmune encephalitis. • Many people have a headache, fever and other symptoms of an infection followed by: Psychiatric symptoms that may include anxiety, panic attacks, changes in behavior, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and trouble organizing thoughts. • Trouble with memory. • Trouble with language, such as talking less or repeating words or phrases. • Movements that are not voluntary. • Seizures. • Changes in consciousness. • Less sleep at the beginning of the disease followed by excess sleep during recovery. • Sometimes AE causes serious seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. • These seizures last more than five minutes or occur one after another while the person is not conscious. • Autoimmune encephalitis symptoms can get worse over time. • This disease course is known as progressive. • Symptoms also might alternate between getting better and getting worse. • This course is known as relapsing-remitting. • These are similar to the disease courses people experience with multiple sclerosis. • Get emergency medical care if you or someone you're with has serious symptoms of AE. • This includes having seizures that last more than five minutes or that happen one after another with a loss of consciousness. • Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing. • See your healthcare professional right away if you have any other symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. • AE can become serious quickly if not treated.",
      "Causes": "Autoimmune encephalitis causes are not known. • Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks heathy brain cells. • Antibodies are part of the immune system. • They help protect the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. • But in autoimmune encephalitis, the antibodies target and attack certain receptors in the brain. • This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and other symptoms. • AE may be triggered by: Certain cancers. • When this happens, it's known as paraneoplastic AE. • Infections, such as from the herpes simplex virus. • Certain medicines, such as monoclonal antibodies and medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant. • Autoimmune encephalitis is more likely to occur in people who have an autoimmune disease or who have a strong family history of autoimmune disease. • There are several different types of AE. • Each type of autoimmune encephalitis is caused by the immune system attacking different receptors in the brain. • Some of the types and causes include: Anti-NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. • This is the most common type of AE. • In this type, antibodies attack the NMDA receptor in the brain. • It often affects young women and children and can cause seizures, facial movements, psychosis and other symptoms. • Anti-GABA-B receptor encephalitis. • This type of AE is related to a tumor, often small-cell lung cancer. • This type of AE can cause seizures, confusion and memory loss. • The average age of diagnosis of this type is 60. • Anti-GABA-A receptor encephalitis. • People with this type of AE are usually diagnosed around age 40, but children also can have this type of AE. • This type of AE can cause seizures, movement disorders, and changes in thinking and behavior. • Anti-AMPA receptor encephalitis. • This type of AE usually affects women and can cause confusion and memory loss. • The average age of diagnosis is age 62. • Anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis. • This type of autoimmune encephalitis tends to affect men. • It can cause memory loss, confusion and seizures. • The average age of diagnosis is age 60. • Anti-CASPR2 associated encephalitis. • People with this type of AE often have symptoms that include confusion, memory loss, trouble with sleep, nerve pain and other symptoms. • This type also can cause a rare disease known as Morvan syndrome. • Morvan syndrome can cause hallucinations, memory loss, changes in blood pressure and painful cramps. • Men are more likely to have this type of AE. • The average age of diagnosis is 60. • Anti-IgLON5 disease. • People who have this type of AE have sleep symptoms that include behaviors and movements after falling asleep. • The average age of diagnosis is 64.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, include: Having had AE in the past, especially if it wasn't treated. • Having had herpes simplex virus encephalitis. • Taking monoclonal antibodies or medicines to suppress the immune system after a transplant. • Having a tumor, especially small-cell lung cancer. • Researchers are studying whether certain genes may be related to autoimmune encephalitis.",
      "Complications": "Serious autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can lead to complications such as: Seizures that need emergency care, known as status epilepticus. • The immune system's attack on the brain during AE can lead to seizures and a condition called autoimmune epilepsy. • Sometimes the seizures may last more than five minutes or occur one after another. • The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. • These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus. • Not enough air entering the lungs, known as respiratory failure. • People with respiratory failure may need treatment with a machine that helps them breathe, known as mechanical ventilation. • Trouble with heart rate and blood pressure. • AE can affect heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination. • These are known as autonomic functions. • Fevers. • People with AE may have high fevers. • Another possible complication is that the condition may come back after recovery. • This is known as a relapse. • A relapse is more likely in people who had anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis or anti-CASPR2 associated encephalitis.",
      "Prevention": "Autoimmune encephalitis, also known as AE, can't always be prevented. • But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. • This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis that is triggered by cancers. • Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if cancer screening is recommended."

      "Overview": "Autoimmune epilepsy is a type of epilepsy where seizures are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking brain cells. • It can occur with conditions that affect the immune system, especially autoimmune encephalitis. • Autoimmune epilepsy also is known as autoimmune associated epilepsy and acute symptomatic seizures secondary to autoimmune encephalitis. • The immune system protects the body from viruses, bacteria and other substances that can cause illnesses. • Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. • In autoimmune epilepsy, antibodies mistakenly target receptors in the brain. • This leads to swelling in the brain, also known as inflammation, and seizures. • Antiseizure medicines usually don't do enough to manage seizures in people with autoimmune epilepsy. • Instead, immunotherapy medicines help reduce the immune response on the brain. • When immunotherapy is started early, it can reduce inflammation and improve seizures. • For some people, treatment can stop seizures completely. • For others, seizures may continue after treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy may begin after an illness with a fever. • Seizures come on suddenly and are serious. • The types of seizures that may occur include: Focal seizures. • These are the most common type of seizure in autoimmune epilepsy. • Sometimes focal seizures cause a change or loss of awareness. • The seizures may cause the person to stare and not respond to the environment. • Other types of focal seizures don't cause a change in awareness. • These seizures cause different symptoms depending on which part of the brain causes them. • Focal seizures may cause one part of the body to shake. • Or they may cause a feeling that his has happened before, known as déjà vu. • Focal seizures also may cause nausea or vision symptoms, such as flashing lights. • Faciobrachial dystonic seizures. • These seizures cause muscle contractions on one side of the face and in an arm, both on the same side of the body. • Symptoms related to seizures include: Seizures that happen several times a day. • Seizures that don't go away with antiseizure medicines. • Seizures that last more than five minutes or that occur close together without the person regaining consciousness, known as status epilepticus. • Autoimmune epilepsy symptoms also may include: Memory loss and trouble with thinking. • Personality and behavior changes. • Involuntary movements or clumsy movements. • Irregular eye movements. • Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and other automatic functions. • Get emergency medical care if you or someone you are with has a seizure that lasts more than five minutes or if seizures occur one after another with a loss of consciousness. • Also seek emergency medical care for high fevers or trouble breathing. • See your healthcare professional right away if you have had a seizure for the first time or if you have other symptoms of autoimmune epilepsy.",
      "Causes": "Autoimmune epilepsy is caused by the immune system attacking brain cells and leading to seizures. • Antibodies are part of the immune system. • They usually protect the body from viruses and infections. • But in autoimmune conditions, the immune system attacks healthy cells. • More recently, research has concluded that epilepsy can be an autoimmune disease. • Autoimmune epilepsy causes may include: Autoimmune encephalitis. • Autoimmune encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is a group of conditions that causes swelling in the brain. • This happens because the immune system mistakenly attacks brain cells. • Autoimmune encephalitis causes a variety of symptoms, including seizures. • It is the most common cause of autoimmune epilepsy. • Certain types of autoimmune encephalitis are commonly linked to autoimmune epilepsy and are associated with antibodies that target NMDA-receptors, LGI1, CASPR2 and GAD65. • Rasmussen syndrome. • In this condition, immune cells known as T cells cause inflammation and brain damage that lead to seizures. • People with autoimmune epilepsy due to Rasmussen syndrome may continue to have seizures after treatment. • Cancer. • Sometimes tumors trigger the immune system to attack healthy brain cells, known as paraneoplastic syndrome. • This can lead to epilepsy.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of autoimmune epilepsy is low, but it can occur in both adults and children. • Risk factors include: Having another autoimmune disease. • These may include rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or lupus. • Having a history of cancer. • Having a parent, sibling or child with an autoimmune disease.",
      "Complications": "Autoimmune epilepsy complications can include serious seizures that last more than five minutes or occur one after another. • The person isn't conscious in between the seizures. • These serious seizures are known as status epilepticus. • They need emergency medical attention. • Sometimes autoimmune epilepsy can lead to seizures that don't stop with treatment.",
      "Prevention": "You may not be able to prevent autoimmune epilepsy. • But getting cancer screenings can help your healthcare professional find tumors and treat them early. • This could prevent autoimmune encephalitis triggered by cancers, which can be a cause of epilepsy. • Talk with your healthcare professional about your cancer risk and if you should get screened for certain cancers."

      "Overview": "Autoimmune hepatitis is a liver disease that happens when the body's immune system attacks the liver. • This can cause swelling, irritation and damage to the liver. • The exact cause of autoimmune hepatitis is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors appear to interact over time to trigger the disease. • Untreated autoimmune hepatitis can lead to scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. • It can also eventually lead to liver failure. • When diagnosed and treated early, however, autoimmune hepatitis often can be controlled with medicines that suppress the immune system. • A liver transplant may be an option when autoimmune hepatitis doesn't respond to medicines or liver disease becomes advanced.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis vary from person to person and may come on suddenly. • Some people have few, if any, recognized problems in the early stages of the disease, whereas others experience symptoms that may include: Fatigue. • Belly discomfort. • Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. • Depending on skin color, this change may be harder or easier to see. • An enlarged liver. • Irregular blood vessels on the skin, called spider angiomas. • Skin rash. • Joint pain. • Loss of menstrual periods. • Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Autoimmune hepatitis occurs when the body's immune system, which usually attacks viruses, bacteria and other causes of disease, instead targets the liver. • This attack on the liver can lead to long-lasting inflammation and serious damage to liver cells. • Just why the body turns against itself is unclear, but researchers think autoimmune hepatitis could be caused by the interaction of genes controlling immune system function and exposure to viruses or medicines. • Experts have identified two main forms of autoimmune hepatitis. • Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. • This is the most common type of the disease. • It can occur at any age. • About half the people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis. • Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. • Although adults can develop type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, it's most common in children and young people. • Other autoimmune diseases may accompany this type of autoimmune hepatitis.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase your risk of autoimmune hepatitis include: Being female. • Although both males and females can develop autoimmune hepatitis, the disease is most common in females. • Genetics. • Evidence suggests that a predisposition to autoimmune hepatitis may run in families. • Having an autoimmune disease. • People who already have an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis), may be more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis.",
      "Complications": "Autoimmune hepatitis that goes untreated can cause permanent scarring of the liver tissue, known as cirrhosis. • Complications of cirrhosis include: Enlarged veins in the esophagus, called esophageal varices. • The portal vein carries blood from the intestine to the liver. • When circulation through the portal vein is blocked, blood may back up into other blood vessels, mainly those in the stomach and esophagus. • These blood vessels have thin walls. • And because they become filled with more blood than they're meant to carry, they're likely to bleed. • Massive bleeding in the esophagus or stomach from these blood vessels is a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate medical care. • Fluid in the abdomen, called ascites (uh-SY-teez). • Liver disease can cause large amounts of fluid to build up in the belly. • Ascites can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing. • It's usually a sign of advanced cirrhosis. • Liver failure. • Liver failure happens when extensive damage to liver cells makes it not possible for the liver to function well. • At this point, a liver transplant is needed. • Liver cancer. • People with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer."
