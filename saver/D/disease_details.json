      "Overview": "Dandruff is a common condition that causes the skin on the scalp to flake. • It isn't contagious or serious. • But it can be embarrassing and difficult to treat. • Mild dandruff can be treated with a gentle daily shampoo. • If that doesn't work, a medicated shampoo may help. • Symptoms may return later. • Dandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis.",
      "Symptoms": "Dandruff signs and symptoms may include: Skin flakes on your scalp, hair, eyebrows, beard or mustache, and shoulders Itchy scalp Scaly, crusty scalp in infants with cradle cap The signs and symptoms may be more severe if you're stressed, and they tend to flare in cold, dry seasons. • Most people with dandruff don't require a doctor's care. • See your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist) if your condition doesn't improve with regular use of dandruff shampoo. • Dandruff may have several causes, including: Irritated, oily skin Dry skin A yeastlike fungus (malassezia) that feeds on oils on the scalps of most adults Sensitivity to hair care products (contact dermatitis) Other skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema Almost anyone can have dandruff, but certain factors can make you more susceptible: Age. • Dandruff usually begins in young adulthood and continues through middle age. • That doesn't mean older adults don't get dandruff. • For some people, the problem can be lifelong. • Being male. • Dandruff is more prevalent in males than in females. • Certain illnesses. • Parkinson's disease and other diseases that affect the nervous system also seem to increase risk of dandruff. • So does having HIV or a weakened immune system.",

      "Overview": "De Quervain tenosynovitis (dih-kwer-VAIN ten-oh-sine-oh-VIE-tis) is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. • If you have de Quervain tenosynovitis, you will probably feel pain when you turn your wrist, grasp anything or make a fist. • Although the exact cause of de Quervain tenosynovitis isn't known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement — such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports, or lifting a baby — can make it worse.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of de Quervain tenosynovitis include: Pain near the base of the thumb Swelling near the base of the thumb Difficulty moving the thumb and wrist when doing something that involves grasping or pinching A \"sticking\" or \"stop-and-go\" sensation in the thumb when moving it If the condition goes too long without treatment, the pain may spread farther into the thumb or forearm or both. • Moving the thumb and wrist may make the pain worse. • Consult your health care provider if you're still having problems with pain or function and you've already tried: Not using your affected thumb Applying cold to the affected area Using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)",
      "Causes": "De Quervain tenosynovitis affects the two tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. • Tendons are ropelike structures that attach muscle to bone. • Chronic overuse, such as repeating a particular hand motion day after day, may irritate the covering around the tendons. • If the covering becomes irritated, the tendons can thicken and swell. • This thickening and swelling restrict the movement of the tendons through the small tunnel that connects them to the base of the thumb. • Other causes of de Quervain tenosynovitis include: Inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. • Direct injury to the wrist or tendon, which may cause scar tissue that restricts movement of the tendons Fluid retention, such as from changes in hormones during pregnancy",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for de Quervain tenosynovitis include: Age. • People between the ages of 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing de Quervain tenosynovitis than do people in other age groups, including children. • Sex. • The condition is more common in women. • Being pregnant. • The condition may be associated with pregnancy. • Baby care. • Lifting a child repeatedly involves using the thumbs as leverage and may be associated with the condition. • Jobs or hobbies that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions. • These may contribute to de Quervain tenosynovitis.",
      "Complications": "When de Quervain tenosynovitis goes untreated, it can become difficult to use the hand and wrist properly. • The wrist may lose some range of motion."

      "Overview": "Delayed ejaculation is a condition in which it takes a long period of sexual arousal to reach climax and release semen from the penis, called ejaculate. • Some people with delayed ejaculation can't ejaculate at all. • Delayed ejaculation can be a brief or lifelong problem. • Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain ongoing health conditions, surgeries and medicines. • Treatment for delayed ejaculation depends on the cause. • Delayed ejaculation can happen from time to time. • Delayed ejaculation is a problem only if it's ongoing and causes stress or worry for you and your partner.",
      "Symptoms": "There's no set time that means a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. • Some people with delayed ejaculation need many minutes of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. • Others might not be able to ejaculate at all, called anejaculation. • In delayed ejaculation, the delay causes upset. • Also delayed ejaculation might mean stopping sex due to tiredness, physical irritation, loss of erection or because the partner wants to stop. • Often, there's trouble reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. • Some people can ejaculate only when masturbating. • But others may not be able to ejaculate by masturbating. • Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms: Lifelong versus acquired. • With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. • Acquired delayed ejaculation happens after a period of typical sexual functioning. • Generalized versus situational. • Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of arousal. • Situational delayed ejaculation happens only under certain conditions. • Your main healthcare professional is a good place to start when you have delayed ejaculation. • See your healthcare professional if: Delayed ejaculation is an issue for you or your partner. • You have another health problem that might be linked to delayed ejaculation. • Or you take medicines that could cause delayed ejaculation. • You have other symptoms along with delayed ejaculation that might or might not seem linked. • Some medicines, certain ongoing health conditions and surgeries can cause delayed ejaculation. • Other causes include substance misuse or a mental health concern, such as depression, anxiety or stress. • Often, it's due to a mix of physical and psychological concerns. • Psychological causes of delayed ejaculation include: Depression, anxiety or other mental health conditions. • Relationship problems due to stress, not communicating well or other concerns. • Anxiety about performance. • Poor body image. • Cultural or religious taboos. • Differences between the reality of sex with a partner and sexual fantasies. • Medicines and other substances that can cause delayed ejaculation include: Some antidepressants or antipsychotics. • Certain high blood pressure medicines. • Certain water pills, called diuretics. • Some antipsychotic medicines. • Some antiseizure medicines. • Too much alcohol. • Physical causes of delayed ejaculation include: Certain birth defects that affect the reproductive system. • Injury to the pelvic nerves that control orgasm. • Certain infections, such as a urinary tract infection. • Prostate surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate or prostate removal. • Neurological diseases, such as diabetic neuropathy, stroke or nerve damage to the spinal cord. • Hormone-related conditions, such as low thyroid hormone level, called hypothyroidism, or low testosterone level, called hypogonadism. • A condition in which the semen goes backward into the bladder rather than out of the penis, called retrograde ejaculation. • The following can increase the risk of having delayed ejaculation: Older age. • With aging, ejaculation takes longer. • Psychological conditions, such as depression or anxiety. • Medical conditions, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis. • Certain medical treatments, such as prostate surgery. • Medicines, such as certain antidepressants, high blood pressure medicines or water pills, called diuretics. • Relationship problems, such as not being able to talk to your partner. • Excessive alcohol use, especially long-term heavy drinking. • Complications of delayed ejaculation can include: Less sexual pleasure for you and your partner. • Stress or anxiety about having sex. • Marital or relationship problems due to a poor sex life. • Not being able to get your partner pregnant, called infertility.",

      "Overview": "Delayed sleep phase is a sleep disorder that affects the internal clock, known as circadian rhythm. • People with this sleep disorder have sleep patterns that are delayed two hours or more from usual sleep patterns. • They go to sleep later and wake later. • This makes it hard to wake in time for work or school. • Delayed sleep phase also is known as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. • A treatment plan might include making changes to sleep habits, taking melatonin supplements and using light therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "People with delayed sleep phase fall asleep and wake later than they want and later than usual sleep and wake times. • Sleep and wake times are delayed at least two hours and may be delayed up to 3 to 6 hours. • People with delayed sleep phase may regularly go to sleep at 3 a.m. and wake at 10 a.m., for example. • Symptoms are persistent. • They last at least three months and often for years. • Symptoms may include: Not being able to fall asleep at a typical bedtime, known as insomnia. • Trouble waking up in the morning in time to go to work or school. • Extreme daytime drowsiness. • Trouble staying alert during the day. • See a health care professional if you have persistent symptoms of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. • Or make an appointment for your child if you think your child has symptoms of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder that don't go away. • Also make an appointment if you or your child regularly has trouble waking in the morning or has excessive daytime drowsiness.",
      "Causes": "Delayed sleep phase is caused by a person's internal clock being out of sync with the environment. • Your internal clock lets you know when it's time to sleep and when it's time to wake. • Known as circadian rhythm, your internal clock is on a 24-hour cycle. • Cues in the environment influence the sleep-wake cycle. • These cues include light, darkness, eating and physical activity. • The exact cause of delayed sleep phase isn't known. • But circadian rhythms can be delayed in teenagers for biological reasons. • Staying up late to do homework, watch TV or use the internet can make the sleep delay worse.",
      "Risk factors": "Delayed sleep phase can affect children and adults of any age. • However, delayed sleep phase is more common among teenagers and young adults."

      "Overview": "Delirium is a serious change in mental abilities. • It results in confused thinking and a lack of awareness of someone's surroundings. • The disorder usually comes on fast — within hours or a few days. • Delirium can often be traced to one or more factors. • Factors may include a severe or long illness or an imbalance in the body, such as low sodium. • The disorder also may be caused by certain medicines, infection, surgery, or alcohol or drug use or withdrawal. • Symptoms of delirium are sometimes confused with symptoms of dementia. • Health care providers may rely on input from a family member or caregiver to diagnose the disorder.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. • They typically occur with a medical problem. • Symptoms often come and go during the day. • There may be periods of no symptoms. • Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. • They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital. • Primary symptoms include the following. • This may result in: Trouble focusing on a topic or changing topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions Being easily distracted Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings This may appear as: Poor memory, such as forgetting recent events Not knowing where they are or who they are Trouble with speech or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Trouble reading or writing These may include: Anxiety, fear or distrust of others Depression A short temper or anger A sense of feeling elated Lack of interest and emotion Quick changes in mood Personality changes Seeing things that others don't see Being restless, anxious or combative Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults Slowed movement or being sluggish Changes in sleep habits A switched night-day sleep-wake cycle Experts have identified three types: Hyperactive delirium. • This may be the easiest type to recognize. • People with this type may be restless and pace the room. • They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. • People with this type often resist care. • Hypoactive delirium. • People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. • They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. • They might seem to be in a daze. • They don't interact with family or others. • Mixed delirium. • Symptoms involve both types of delirium. • The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish. • Delirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. • Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. • The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years. • Delirium often occurs in people with dementia. • However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. • Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. • Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include: Onset. • The onset of delirium occurs within a short time — within a day or two. • Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time. • Attention. • The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. • A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. • Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. • Rapid changes in symptoms. • Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. • While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level. • If a relative, friend or someone in your care shows symptoms of delirium, talk to the person's health care provider. • Your input about symptoms, typical thinking and usual abilities will be important for a diagnosis. • It also can help the provider find the cause of the disorder. • If you notice symptoms in someone in the hospital or nursing home, report your concerns to the nursing staff or health care provider. • The symptoms may not have been observed. • Older people who are in the hospital or are living in a long-term care center are at risk of delirium. • Delirium occurs when signals in the brain aren't sent and received properly. • The disorder may have a single cause or more than one cause. • For example, a medical condition combined with the side effects of a medicine could cause delirium. • Sometimes no cause can be found. • Possible causes include: Certain medicines or medicine side effects Alcohol or drug use or withdrawal A medical condition such as a stroke, heart attack, worsening lung or liver disease, or an injury from a fall An imbalance in the body, such as low sodium or low calcium Severe, long-lasting illness or an illness that will lead to death Fever and a new infection, particularly in children Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, the flu or COVID-19, especially in older adults Exposure to a toxin, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide or other poisons Poor nutrition or a loss of too much body fluid Lack of sleep or severe emotional distress Pain Surgery or another medical procedure that requires being put in a sleep-like state Some medicines taken alone or taken in combination can trigger delirium. • These include medicines that treat: Pain Sleep problems Mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression Allergies Asthma Swelling Parkinson's disease Spasms or convulsions Any condition that results in a hospital stay increases the risk of delirium. • This is mostly true when someone is recovering from surgery or is put in intensive care. • Delirium is more common in older adults and in people who live in nursing homes. • Examples of other conditions that may increase the risk of delirium include: Brain disorders such as dementia, stroke or Parkinson's disease Past delirium episodes Vision or hearing loss Multiple medical problems Delirium may last only a few hours or as long as several weeks or months. • If the causes are addressed, the recovery time is often shorter. • Recovery depends to some extent on the health and mental status before symptoms began. • People with dementia, for example, may experience an overall decline in memory and thinking skills after a delirium episode. • People in better health are more likely to fully recover. • People with other serious, long-lasting or terminal illnesses may not regain the thinking skills or function that they had before the onset of delirium. • Delirium in seriously ill people is more likely to lead to: A general decline in health Poor recovery from surgery The need for long-term care An increased risk of death The best way to prevent delirium is to target risk factors that might trigger an episode. • Hospital settings present a special challenge. • Hospital stays often involve room changes, invasive procedures, loud noises and poor lighting. • Lack of natural light and lack of sleep can make confusion worse. • Some steps can help prevent or reduce the severity of delirium. • To do this, promote good sleep habits, help the person remain calm and well-oriented, and help prevent medical problems or other complications. • Also avoid medicines used for sleep, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy, Unisom, others).",

      "Overview": "Dementia is a term used to describe a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities. • In people who have dementia, the symptoms interfere with their daily lives. • Dementia isn't one specific disease. • Several diseases can cause dementia. • Dementia generally involves memory loss. • It's often one of the early symptoms of the condition. • But having memory loss alone doesn't mean you have dementia. • Memory loss can have different causes. • Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, but there are other causes of dementia. • Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms might be reversible.",
      "Symptoms": "Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause. • Common symptoms include: Memory loss, which is usually noticed by someone else. • Problems communicating or finding words. • Trouble with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving. • Problems with reasoning or problem-solving. • Trouble performing complex tasks. • Trouble with planning and organizing. • Poor coordination and control of movements. • Confusion and disorientation. • Personality changes. • Depression. • Anxiety. • Agitation. • Inappropriate behavior. • Being suspicious, known as paranoia. • Seeing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. • See a health care professional if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. • It's important to determine the cause. • Some medical conditions that cause dementia symptoms can be treated. • Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain. • The symptoms depend on the area of the brain that's damaged. • Dementia can affect people differently. • Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common. • They may be grouped by the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or by the part of the brain that's affected. • Also, some diseases have symptoms like those of dementia. • And some medicines can cause a reaction that includes dementia symptoms. • Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals also can cause dementia symptoms. • When this occurs, dementia symptoms may improve with treatment. • Dementias that are progressive get worse over time. • Types of dementias that worsen and aren't reversible include: Alzheimer's disease. • This is the most common cause of dementia. • Although not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known, experts do know that a small percentage are related to changes in three genes. • These gene changes can be passed down from parent to child. • While several genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE). • People with Alzheimer's disease have plaques and tangles in their brains. • Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid. • Tangles are fibrous masses made up of tau protein. • It's thought that these clumps damage healthy brain cells and the fibers connecting them. • Vascular dementia. • This type of dementia is caused by damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. • Blood vessel problems can cause stroke or affect the brain in other ways, such as by damaging the fibers in the white matter of the brain. • The most common symptoms of vascular dementia include problems with problem-solving, slowed thinking, and loss of focus and organization. • These tend to be more noticeable than memory loss. • Lewy body dementia. • Lewy bodies are balloonlike clumps of protein. • They have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. • Lewy body dementia is one of the more common types of dementia. • Common symptoms include acting out dreams in sleep and seeing things that aren't there, known as visual hallucinations. • Symptoms also include problems with focus and attention. • Other signs include uncoordinated or slow movement, tremors, and stiffness, known as parkinsonism. • Frontotemporal dementia. • This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown of nerve cells and their connections in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. • These areas are associated with personality, behavior and language. • Common symptoms affect behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, language and movement. • Mixed dementia. • Autopsy studies of the brains of people age 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of several causes. • People with mixed dementia can have Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. • Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments. • Huntington's disease. • Huntington's disease is caused by a genetic change. • The disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to waste away. • Symptoms include a decline in thinking skills, known as cognitive skills. • Symptoms usually appear around age 30 or 40. • Traumatic brain injury (TBI). • This condition is most often caused by repetitive head trauma. • Boxers, football players or soldiers might develop TBI. • Dementia symptoms depend on the part of the brain that's injured. • TBI can cause depression, explosiveness, memory loss and impaired speech. • TBI also may cause slow movement, tremors and stiffness. • Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma. • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. • This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors. • This condition might be due to deposits of infectious proteins called prions. • Symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear after age 60. • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually has no known cause but it can be passed down from a parent. • It also may be caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue, such as from a cornea transplant. • Parkinson's disease. • Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop dementia symptoms. • When this happens, it's known as Parkinson's disease dementia. • Some causes of dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment. • They include: Infections and immune disorders. • Dementia-like symptoms can result from a fever or other side effects of the body's attempt to fight off an infection. • Multiple sclerosis and other conditions caused by the body's immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. • Metabolic or endocrine problems. • People with thyroid problems and low blood sugar can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes. • This also is true for people who have too little or too much sodium or calcium, or problems absorbing vitamin B-12. • Low levels of certain nutrients. • Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals in your diet can cause dementia symptoms. • This includes not getting enough thiamin, also known as vitamin B-1, which is common in people with alcohol use disorder. • It also includes not getting enough vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, copper or vitamin E. • Not drinking enough liquids, leading to dehydration, also can cause dementia symptoms. • Medicine side effects. • Side effects of medicines, a reaction to a medicine or an interaction of several medicines can cause dementia-like symptoms. • Subdural bleeding. • Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain can be common in older adults after a fall. • Subdural bleeding can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia. • Brain tumors. • Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. • Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. • This condition is a buildup of fluid in the cavities in the brain known as ventricles. • It can result in walking problems, loss of bladder control and memory loss. • Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia. • Some factors, such as age, can't be changed. • You can address other factors to reduce your risk. • Age. • The risk of dementia rises as you age, especially after age 65. • However, dementia isn't a typical part of aging. • Dementia also can occur in younger people. • Family history. • Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. • However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. • There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic changes that may increase your risk. • Down syndrome. • By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease. • You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia. • Diet and exercise. • Research has found that people at higher risk of dementia who followed a healthy lifestyle lowered their risk of cognitive decline. • They ate a diet that included fish, fruits, vegetables and oils. • They also exercised, had cognitive training and participated in social activities. • While no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates that those who follow a Mediterranean style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds have better cognitive function. • Drinking too much alcohol. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. • Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia. • Cardiovascular risk factors. • These include obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and the buildup of fats in the artery walls, known as atherosclerosis. • Having high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in particular, is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. • Diabetes and smoking also are cardiovascular risk factors. • Having diabetes can increase the risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. • Smoking might increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel disease. • Hearing loss or vision loss that is not treated. • Having hearing loss is associated with a higher risk of dementia. • The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. • Research also suggests that vision loss can raise the risk of dementia, while treating vision loss can lower the risk. • Depression. • Although not yet well understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. • Air pollution. • Studies in animals have indicated that air pollution particulates can speed degeneration of the nervous system. • And human studies have found that air pollution exposure — particularly from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is associated with greater dementia risk. • Head trauma. • People who've had a severe head trauma have a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease. • Several large studies found that in people age 50 years or older who had a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease increased. • The risk increases in people with more-severe and multiple TBIs. • Some studies indicate that the risk may be greatest within the first six months to two years after the TBI. • Sleep symptoms. • People who have sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances might be at higher risk of developing dementia. • Low levels of certain vitamins and nutrients. • Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate can increase the risk of dementia. • Medicines that can worsen memory. • These include sleep aids that contain diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and medicines to treat urinary urgency such as oxybutynin (Ditropan XL). • Also limit sedatives and sleeping tablets. • Talk to a health care professional about whether any of the medicines you take might make your memory worse. • Dementia can affect many body systems and, therefore, the ability to function. • Dementia can lead to: Poor nutrition. • Many people with dementia eventually reduce or stop eating, affecting their nutrient intake. • Ultimately, they may be unable to chew and swallow. • Pneumonia. • Trouble swallowing increases the risk of choking. • And food or liquids can enter the lungs, known as aspiration. • This can block breathing and cause pneumonia. • Inability to perform self-care tasks. • As dementia gets worse, people have a hard time bathing, dressing, and brushing their hair or teeth. • They need help using the toilet and taking medicines as directed. • Personal safety challenges. • Some day-to-day situations can present safety issues for people with dementia. • These include driving, cooking, and walking and living alone. • Death. • Coma and death can occur in late-stage dementia. • This often happens because of an infection. • There's no sure way to prevent dementia, but there are steps you can take that might help. • More research is needed, but it might help to do the following: Keep your mind active. • Mentally stimulating activities might delay the onset of dementia and decrease its effects. • Spend time reading, solving puzzles and playing word games. • Be physically and socially active. • Physical activity and social interaction might delay the onset of dementia and reduce its symptoms. • Aim for 150 minutes of exercise a week. • Quit smoking. • Some studies have shown that smoking in middle age and beyond might increase the risk of dementia and blood vessel conditions. • Quitting smoking might reduce the risk and improve health. • Get enough vitamins. • Some research suggests that people with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. • You can increase your vitamin D levels with certain foods, supplements and sun exposure. • More study is needed before an increase in vitamin D intake is recommended for preventing dementia. • But it's a good idea to make sure you get adequate vitamin D. • Taking a daily B-complex vitamin and vitamin C also might help. • Manage cardiovascular risk factors. • Treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Pay attention to your levels of LDL cholesterol and get treatment if the levels are too high. • High levels of LDL in middle age raises the risk of dementia. • Lose weight if you're overweight. • High blood pressure might lead to a higher risk of some types of dementia. • More research is needed to determine whether treating high blood pressure may reduce the risk of dementia. • Treat health conditions. • See your doctor for treatment of depression or anxiety. • Maintain a healthy diet. • A diet such as the Mediterranean diet might promote health and lower the risk of developing dementia. • A Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in certain fish and nuts. • This type of diet also improves cardiovascular health, which also may help lower dementia risk. • Get good-quality sleep. • Practice good sleep hygiene. • Talk to a health care professional if you snore loudly or have periods where you stop breathing or gasp during sleep. • Treat hearing loss. • People with hearing loss have a greater chance of developing problems with thinking, known as cognitive decline. • Early treatment of hearing loss, such as use of hearing aids, might help decrease the risk. • Get regular eye exams and treat vision loss. • Research suggests that not treating vision loss may be associated with a raised risk of dementia.",
      "Causes": "Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain. • The symptoms depend on the area of the brain that's damaged. • Dementia can affect people differently. • Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common. • They may be grouped by the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or by the part of the brain that's affected. • Also, some diseases have symptoms like those of dementia. • And some medicines can cause a reaction that includes dementia symptoms. • Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals also can cause dementia symptoms. • When this occurs, dementia symptoms may improve with treatment. • Dementias that are progressive get worse over time. • Types of dementias that worsen and aren't reversible include: Alzheimer's disease. • This is the most common cause of dementia. • Although not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known, experts do know that a small percentage are related to changes in three genes. • These gene changes can be passed down from parent to child. • While several genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE). • People with Alzheimer's disease have plaques and tangles in their brains. • Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid. • Tangles are fibrous masses made up of tau protein. • It's thought that these clumps damage healthy brain cells and the fibers connecting them. • Vascular dementia. • This type of dementia is caused by damage to the vessels that supply blood to the brain. • Blood vessel problems can cause stroke or affect the brain in other ways, such as by damaging the fibers in the white matter of the brain. • The most common symptoms of vascular dementia include problems with problem-solving, slowed thinking, and loss of focus and organization. • These tend to be more noticeable than memory loss. • Lewy body dementia. • Lewy bodies are balloonlike clumps of protein. • They have been found in the brains of people with Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. • Lewy body dementia is one of the more common types of dementia. • Common symptoms include acting out dreams in sleep and seeing things that aren't there, known as visual hallucinations. • Symptoms also include problems with focus and attention. • Other signs include uncoordinated or slow movement, tremors, and stiffness, known as parkinsonism. • Frontotemporal dementia. • This is a group of diseases characterized by the breakdown of nerve cells and their connections in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. • These areas are associated with personality, behavior and language. • Common symptoms affect behavior, personality, thinking, judgment, language and movement. • Mixed dementia. • Autopsy studies of the brains of people age 80 and older who had dementia indicate that many had a combination of several causes. • People with mixed dementia can have Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. • Studies are ongoing to determine how having mixed dementia affects symptoms and treatments. • Huntington's disease. • Huntington's disease is caused by a genetic change. • The disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to waste away. • Symptoms include a decline in thinking skills, known as cognitive skills. • Symptoms usually appear around age 30 or 40. • Traumatic brain injury (TBI). • This condition is most often caused by repetitive head trauma. • Boxers, football players or soldiers might develop TBI. • Dementia symptoms depend on the part of the brain that's injured. • TBI can cause depression, explosiveness, memory loss and impaired speech. • TBI also may cause slow movement, tremors and stiffness. • Symptoms might not appear until years after the trauma. • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. • This rare brain disorder usually occurs in people without known risk factors. • This condition might be due to deposits of infectious proteins called prions. • Symptoms of this fatal condition usually appear after age 60. • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually has no known cause but it can be passed down from a parent. • It also may be caused by exposure to diseased brain or nervous system tissue, such as from a cornea transplant. • Parkinson's disease. • Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop dementia symptoms. • When this happens, it's known as Parkinson's disease dementia. • Some causes of dementia-like symptoms can be reversed with treatment. • They include: Infections and immune disorders. • Dementia-like symptoms can result from a fever or other side effects of the body's attempt to fight off an infection. • Multiple sclerosis and other conditions caused by the body's immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. • Metabolic or endocrine problems. • People with thyroid problems and low blood sugar can develop dementia-like symptoms or other personality changes. • This also is true for people who have too little or too much sodium or calcium, or problems absorbing vitamin B-12. • Low levels of certain nutrients. • Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals in your diet can cause dementia symptoms. • This includes not getting enough thiamin, also known as vitamin B-1, which is common in people with alcohol use disorder. • It also includes not getting enough vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, copper or vitamin E. • Not drinking enough liquids, leading to dehydration, also can cause dementia symptoms. • Medicine side effects. • Side effects of medicines, a reaction to a medicine or an interaction of several medicines can cause dementia-like symptoms. • Subdural bleeding. • Bleeding between the surface of the brain and the covering over the brain can be common in older adults after a fall. • Subdural bleeding can cause symptoms similar to those of dementia. • Brain tumors. • Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. • Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. • This condition is a buildup of fluid in the cavities in the brain known as ventricles. • It can result in walking problems, loss of bladder control and memory loss.",
      "Risk factors": "Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia. • Some factors, such as age, can't be changed. • You can address other factors to reduce your risk. • Age. • The risk of dementia rises as you age, especially after age 65. • However, dementia isn't a typical part of aging. • Dementia also can occur in younger people. • Family history. • Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. • However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. • There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic changes that may increase your risk. • Down syndrome. • By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease. • You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia. • Diet and exercise. • Research has found that people at higher risk of dementia who followed a healthy lifestyle lowered their risk of cognitive decline. • They ate a diet that included fish, fruits, vegetables and oils. • They also exercised, had cognitive training and participated in social activities. • While no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates that those who follow a Mediterranean style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds have better cognitive function. • Drinking too much alcohol. • Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. • Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia. • Cardiovascular risk factors. • These include obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and the buildup of fats in the artery walls, known as atherosclerosis. • Having high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in particular, is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. • Diabetes and smoking also are cardiovascular risk factors. • Having diabetes can increase the risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. • Smoking might increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel disease. • Hearing loss or vision loss that is not treated. • Having hearing loss is associated with a higher risk of dementia. • The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. • Research also suggests that vision loss can raise the risk of dementia, while treating vision loss can lower the risk. • Depression. • Although not yet well understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. • Air pollution. • Studies in animals have indicated that air pollution particulates can speed degeneration of the nervous system. • And human studies have found that air pollution exposure — particularly from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is associated with greater dementia risk. • Head trauma. • People who've had a severe head trauma have a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease. • Several large studies found that in people age 50 years or older who had a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease increased. • The risk increases in people with more-severe and multiple TBIs. • Some studies indicate that the risk may be greatest within the first six months to two years after the TBI. • Sleep symptoms. • People who have sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances might be at higher risk of developing dementia. • Low levels of certain vitamins and nutrients. • Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate can increase the risk of dementia. • Medicines that can worsen memory. • These include sleep aids that contain diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and medicines to treat urinary urgency such as oxybutynin (Ditropan XL). • Also limit sedatives and sleeping tablets. • Talk to a health care professional about whether any of the medicines you take might make your memory worse.",

      "Overview": "Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. • Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. • The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death. • Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. • Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. • But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States. • Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. • For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population.",
      "Symptoms": "Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection. • When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses — such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. • Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms: Headache Muscle, bone or joint pain Nausea Vomiting Pain behind the eyes Swollen glands Rash Most people recover within a week or so. • In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. • This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. • Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. • And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. • This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. • Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. • The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include: Severe stomach pain Persistent vomiting Bleeding from your gums or nose Blood in your urine, stools or vomit Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising Difficult or rapid breathing Fatigue Irritability or restlessness Severe dengue fever is a life-threatening medical emergency. • Seek immediate medical attention if you've recently visited an area in which dengue fever is known to occur, you have had a fever and you develop any of the warning signs. • Warning signs include severe stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or blood in your nose, gums, vomit or stools. • If you've been traveling recently and develop a fever and mild symptoms of dengue fever, call your doctor. • Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses. • You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person. • Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites. • The two types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. • When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. • Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection. • After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to the type of virus that infected you — but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. • This means you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. • Your risk of developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third or fourth time. • You have a greater risk of developing dengue fever or a more severe form of the disease if: You live or travel in tropical areas. • Being in tropical and subtropical areas increases your risk of exposure to the virus that causes dengue fever. • Especially high-risk areas include Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. • You have had dengue fever in the past. • Previous infection with a dengue fever virus increases your risk of severe symptoms if you get dengue fever again. • Severe dengue fever can cause internal bleeding and organ damage. • Blood pressure can drop to dangerous levels, causing shock. • In some cases, severe dengue fever can lead to death. • Women who get dengue fever during pregnancy may be able to spread the virus to the baby during childbirth. • Additionally, babies of women who get dengue fever during pregnancy have a higher risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight or fetal distress. • Dengue fever vaccines may be available for people ages 6 to 60. • Dengue vaccination is a series of two or three doses, depending on the vaccine you get, over the course of months. • These vaccines are for use by people who live where the viruses that cause dengue are common, and who have already had dengue fever at least once. • The vaccines are not available in the continental United States. • But in 2019, the U.S. • Food and Drug Administration approved a dengue vaccine called Dengvaxia for people ages 9 to 16 who have had dengue fever in the past and who live in U.S. territories and freely associated states where dengue fever is common. • The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool on its own to reduce dengue fever in areas where the illness is common. • Preventing mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population are still the main methods for preventing the spread of dengue fever. • If you live in or travel to an area where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of mosquito bites: Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing. • The mosquitoes that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk, but they can also bite at night. • Wear protective clothing. • When you go into mosquito-infested areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes. • Use mosquito repellent. • Permethrin can be applied to your clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. • You can also buy clothing made with permethrin already in it. • For your skin, use a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of DEET. • Reduce mosquito habitat. • The mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing water that can collect in such things as used automobile tires. • You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats where they lay their eggs. • At least once a week, empty and clean containers that hold standing water, such as planting containers, animal dishes and flower vases. • Keep standing water containers covered between cleanings.",

      "Overview": "Depersonalization-derealization disorder occurs when you always or often feel that you're seeing yourself from outside your body or you sense that things around you are not real — or both. • Feelings of depersonalization and derealization can be very disturbing. • You may feel like you're living in a dream. • Many people have a passing experience of depersonalization or derealization at some point. • But when these feelings keep occurring or never fully go away, and they make it hard for you to function, it's likely depersonalization-derealization disorder. • This condition is more common in people who experience trauma, such as violence, abuse or other kinds of extreme stress. • Depersonalization-derealization disorder can be serious and may get in the way of your relationships and work. • It also can disrupt other daily activities. • The main treatment for depersonalization-derealization disorder is psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy. • Sometimes medicines also are used.",
      "Symptoms": "Short experiences of depersonalization or derealization are fairly common. • But lasting and returning bouts of these symptoms can cause problems at work or school, or in other important areas of your life. • During these bouts, you know that your sense of not being connected to your body or your surroundings are only feelings and not reality. • The experience and feelings of the condition can be hard to describe. • Worrying about \"going crazy\" can cause you to become focused on checking that you exist and finding out what's real. • Symptoms usually begin in the middle or late teenage years, or in early adulthood. • Depersonalization-derealization disorder is rare in children and older adults. • Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're seeing your thoughts, feelings, or body or parts of your body from the outside. • For example, you may feel like you're floating in the air above yourself. • Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of what you say or how you move. • The sense that your body, legs or arms appear twisted or like they're not the right shape. • Or they may seem larger or smaller than usual. • You also could feel that your head is wrapped in cotton. • Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you. • A sense that your memories lack emotion, and they may or may not be your own memories. • Symptoms of derealization include: Feeling that people and your surroundings are not real, like you're living in a movie or a dream. • Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall. • Surroundings that appear out of their usual shape, or are blurry or colorless. • Or they may seem like they only have two dimensions, so they're flat with no depth. • Or you could be more aware of your surroundings, and they may appear clearer than usual. • Thoughts about time that are not real, such as recent events feeling like the distant past. • Unrealistic thoughts about distance and the size and shape of objects. • Bouts of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or months. • In some people, these bouts turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may get better or worse at times. • Passing feelings of depersonalization or derealization are common and are not always a cause for concern. • But ongoing or serious feelings of detachment and distortion of your surroundings can be a sign of depersonalization-derealization disorder or another physical or mental health condition. • See a doctor if you have feelings of depersonalization or derealization that: Are disturbing you or are disrupting your emotions. • Do not go away or keep coming back. • Get in the way of work, relationships or daily activities. • The cause of depersonalization-derealization disorder is not well understood. • Some people may be more likely to experience depersonalization and derealization than others. • This is possibly due to genetic and environmental factors. • High levels of stress and fear may cause bouts. • Symptoms of depersonalization-derealization disorder may be related to childhood trauma or other experiences or events that cause severe emotional stress or trauma. • Factors that may raise the risk of depersonalization-derealization disorder include: Certain personality traits that make you want to stay away from stressful situations or make it hard to describe your emotional experience. • Serious trauma as a child or an adult, like going through or seeing a traumatic event, such as violence or abuse. • Serious stress, such as major relationship, financial or work-related issues. • Depression or anxiety, especially serious depression, depression that lasts a long time or anxiety with panic attacks. • Drug misuse, which can cause bouts of depersonalization or derealization. • Bouts of depersonalization or derealization can be scary and make it hard to function. • They can: Make it hard to focus on tasks or remember things. • Get in the way of work and other routine activities. • Cause problems in relationships with your family and friends. • Make you feel anxious, depressed or hopeless.",

include: Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain Anxiety, agitation or restlessness Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide Unexplained physical

activities or relationships with others. • Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. • Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences. • In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. • In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction. • Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. • Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. • Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as: Memory difficulties or personality changes Physical aches or pain Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. • If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. • If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number immediately. • Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts: Call your doctor or mental health professional. • Contact a suicide hotline. • In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat. • Services are free and confidential. • U.S. veterans or service members who are in crisis can call 988 and then press “1” for the Veterans Crisis Line. • Or text 838255. • Or chat online. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free). • Reach out to a close friend or loved one. • Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. • If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. • Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. • Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. • It's not known exactly what causes depression. • As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as: Biological differences. • People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. • The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes. • Brain chemistry. • Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. • Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment. • Hormones. • Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. • Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions. • Inherited traits. • Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition. • Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression. • Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. • More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment. • Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include: Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication) Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. • Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life. • Examples of complications associated with depression include: Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes Pain or physical illness Alcohol or drug misuse Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems Social isolation Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide Self-mutilation, such as cutting Premature death from medical conditions There's no sure way to prevent depression. • However, these strategies may help. • Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem. • Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells. • Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening. • Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.",

      "Overview": "Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). • Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. • It's also the brain's main source of fuel. • The main cause of diabetes varies by type. • But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. • Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems. • Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. • Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. • Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. • But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. • And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. • Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. • But it may go away after the baby is born.",
      "Symptoms": "Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. • Some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. • In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. • Some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Feeling more thirsty than usual. • Urinating often. • Losing weight without trying. • Presence of ketones in the urine. • Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin. • Feeling tired and weak. • Feeling irritable or having other mood changes. • Having blurry vision. • Having slow-healing sores. • Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections. • Type 1 diabetes can start at any age. • But it often starts during childhood or teen years. • Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. • Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. • But type 2 diabetes in children is increasing. • If you think you or your child may have diabetes. • If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. • The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. • If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. • After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize. • To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose. • Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas). • The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. • The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells. • Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. • As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. • Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. • Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver. • Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. • The liver stores and makes glucose. • When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. • This keeps your glucose level within a typical range. • The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. • In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. • This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. • Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. • It is unclear what those factors may be. • Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. • Family history may play a part in all types. • Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes. • Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). • If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. • But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. • Race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. • Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. • Prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese. • Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. • The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. • Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. • In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. • Possible complications include: Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. • Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. • These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). • If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke. • Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). • Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. • This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. • Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. • For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction. • Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). • The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. • Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. • Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). • Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. • This could lead to blindness. • Foot damage. • Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications. • Skin and mouth conditions. • Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. • Hearing impairment. • Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. • Alzheimer's disease. • Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. • Depression related to diabetes. • Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. • Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. • However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. • Complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. • Extra glucose can cross the placenta. • Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. • This can cause your baby to grow too large. • It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section. • Low blood sugar. • Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. • This is because their own insulin production is high. • Type 2 diabetes later in life. • Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. • Death. • Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. • Complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. • Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. • Gestational diabetes. • If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. • Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. • But the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. • Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. • Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Eat a variety to keep from feeling bored. • Get more physical activity. • Try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. • Or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. • For example, take a brisk daily walk. • If you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day. • Lose excess pounds. • If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. • For example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes. • But don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. • Talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. • To keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. • Remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem. • Sometimes drugs are an option. • Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. • But healthy lifestyle choices are important. • If you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.",
      "Causes": "To understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose. • Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas). • The pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. • The insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells. • Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. • As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. • Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. • Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver. • Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. • The liver stores and makes glucose. • When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. • This keeps your glucose level within a typical range. • The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. • In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. • This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. • Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. • It is unclear what those factors may be.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. • Family history may play a part in all types. • Environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes. • Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). • If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. • But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. • Race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. • Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. • Prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese.",
      "Complications": "Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. • The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. • Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. • In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. • Possible complications include: Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. • Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. • These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). • If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke. • Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). • Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. • This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. • Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. • For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction. • Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). • The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. • Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. • Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). • Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. • This could lead to blindness. • Foot damage. • Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications. • Skin and mouth conditions. • Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. • Hearing impairment. • Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. • Alzheimer's disease. • Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. • Depression related to diabetes. • Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. • Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. • However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. • Complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. • Extra glucose can cross the placenta. • Extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. • This can cause your baby to grow too large. • It can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a C-section. • Low blood sugar. • Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. • This is because their own insulin production is high. • Type 2 diabetes later in life. • Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. • Death. • Untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. • Complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. • Symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. • Gestational diabetes. • If you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.",

      "Overview": "Diabetes insipidus (die-uh-BEE-teze in-SIP-uh-dus) is an uncommon problem that causes the fluids in the body to become out of balance. • That prompts the body to make large amounts of urine. • It also causes a feeling of being very thirsty even after having something to drink. • Diabetes insipidus also is called arginine vasopressin deficiency and arginine vasopressin resistance. • While the terms \"diabetes insipidus\" and \"diabetes mellitus\" sound alike, the two conditions are not connected. • Diabetes mellitus involves high blood sugar levels. • It's a common condition, and it's often called simply diabetes. • There's no cure for diabetes insipidus. • But treatment is available that can ease its symptoms. • That includes relieving thirst, lowering the amount of urine the body makes and preventing dehydration.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of diabetes insipidus in adults include: Being very thirsty, often with a preference for cold water. • Making large amounts of pale urine. • Getting up to urinate and drink water often during the night. • Adults typically urinate an average of 1 to 3 quarts (about 1 to 3 liters) a day. • People who have diabetes insipidus and who drink a lot of fluids may make as much as 20 quarts (about 19 liters) of urine a day. • A baby or young child who has diabetes insipidus may have these symptoms: Large amounts of pale urine that result in heavy, wet diapers. • Bed-wetting. • Being very thirsty, with a preference for drinking water and cold liquids. • Weight loss. • Poor growth. • Vomiting. • Irritability. • Fever. • Constipation. • Headache. • Problems sleeping. • Vision problems. • See your health care provider right away if you notice that you're urinating much more than usual and you're very thirsty on a regular basis. • Diabetes insipidus happens when the body can't balance its fluid levels in a healthy way. • Fluid in the blood is filtered through the kidneys to remove waste. • Afterward, most of that fluid is returned to the bloodstream. • The waste and a small amount of fluid leave the kidneys as urine. • Urine leaves the body after it's temporarily stored in the bladder. • A hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) — also called vasopressin — is needed to get the fluid that's filtered by the kidneys back into the bloodstream. • ADH is made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. • It's then stored in the pituitary gland, a small gland found at the base of the brain. • Conditions that cause the brain to make too little ADH or disorders that block the effect of ADH cause the body to make too much urine. • In diabetes insipidus, the body can't properly balance fluid levels. • The cause of the fluid imbalance depends on the type of diabetes insipidus. • Central diabetes insipidus. • Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus from surgery, a tumor, a head injury or an illness can cause central diabetes insipidus. • That damage affects the production, storage and release of ADH. • An inherited disorder may cause this condition too. • It also can be the result of an autoimmune reaction that causes the body's immune system to damage the cells that make ADH. • Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. • This happens when there's a problem with the kidneys that makes them unable to properly respond to ADH. • That problem may be due to: An inherited disorder. • Certain medicines, including lithium and antiviral medicines such as foscarnet (Foscavir). • Low levels of potassium in the blood. • High levels of calcium in the blood. • A blocked urinary tract or a urinary tract infection. • A chronic kidney condition. • Gestational diabetes insipidus. • This rare form of diabetes insipidus only happens during pregnancy. • It develops when an enzyme made by the placenta destroys ADH in a pregnant person. • Primary polydipsia. • This condition also is called dipsogenic diabetes insipidus. • People who have this disorder constantly feel thirsty and drink lots of fluids. • It can be caused by damage to the thirst-regulating mechanism in the hypothalamus. • It also has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia. • Sometimes no clear cause of diabetes insipidus can be found. • In that case, repeat testing over time often is useful. • Testing may be able to identify an underlying cause eventually. • Anyone can get diabetes insipidus. • But those at higher risk include people who: Have a family history of the disorder. • Take certain medicines, such as diuretics, that could lead to kidney problems. • Have high levels of calcium or low levels of potassium in their blood. • Have had a serious head injury or brain surgery. • Diabetes insipidus may lead to dehydration. • That happens when the body loses too much fluid. • Dehydration can cause: Dry mouth. • Thirst. • Extreme tiredness. • Dizziness. • Lightheadedness. • Fainting. • Nausea. • Diabetes insipidus can change the levels of minerals in the blood that maintain the body's balance of fluids. • Those minerals, called electrolytes, include sodium and potassium. • Symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance may include: Weakness. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Loss of appetite. • Confusion.",

      "Symptoms": "In the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, there might not be symptoms. • In later stages, symptoms may include: High blood pressure that gets harder to control. • Swelling of feet, ankles, hands or eyes. • Foamy urine. • Confusion or difficulty thinking. • Shortness of breath. • Loss of appetite. • Nausea and vomiting. • Itching. • Tiredness and weakness. • Make an appointment with your health care professional if you have symptoms of kidney disease. • If you have diabetes, visit your health care professional yearly or as often as you're told for tests that measure how well your kidneys are working.",
      "Causes": "Diabetic nephropathy happens when diabetes damages blood vessels and other cells in the kidneys. • The kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessel clusters called glomeruli. • Glomeruli filter waste from the blood. • Damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy. • The damage can keep the kidneys from working as they should and lead to kidney failure. • Diabetic nephropathy is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. • Over time, diabetes that isn't well controlled can damage blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. • This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. • High blood pressure can cause more kidney damage by raising the pressure in the filtering system of the kidneys.",
      "Risk factors": "If you have diabetes, the following can raise your risk of diabetic nephropathy: Uncontrolled high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia. • Uncontrolled high blood pressure, also called hypertension. • Smoking. • High blood cholesterol. • Obesity. • A family history of diabetes and kidney disease.",
      "Complications": "Complications of diabetic nephropathy can come on slowly over months or years. • They may include: Body fluid buildup. • This could lead to swelling in the arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary edema. • A rise in the levels of the mineral potassium in the blood, called hyperkalemia. • Heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease. • This could lead to a stroke. • Fewer red blood cells to carry oxygen. • This condition also is called anemia. • Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the pregnant person and the growing fetus. • Damage to the kidneys that can't be fixed. • This is called end-stage kidney disease. • Treatment is either dialysis or a kidney transplant.",
      "Prevention": "To lower your risk of developing diabetic nephropathy: See your health care team regularly to manage diabetes. • Keep appointments to check on how well you are managing your diabetes and to check for diabetic nephropathy and other complications. • Your appointments might be yearly or more often. • Treat your diabetes. • With good treatment of diabetes, you can keep your blood sugar levels in the target range as much as possible. • This may prevent or slow diabetic nephropathy. • Manage high blood pressure or other medical conditions. • If you have high blood pressure or other conditions that raise your risk of kidney disease, work with your health care professional to control them. • Take medicines you get without a prescription only as directed. • Read the labels on the pain relievers you take. • This might include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). • For people with diabetic nephropathy, these types of pain relievers can lead to kidney damage. • Stay at a healthy weight. • If you're at a healthy weight, work to stay that way by being physically active most days of the week. • If you need to lose weight, talk with a member of your health care team about the best way for you to lose weight. • Don't smoke. • Cigarette smoking can damage kidneys or make kidney damage worse. • If you're a smoker, talk to a member of your health care team about ways to quit. • Support groups, counseling and some medicines might help."

      "Overview": "Diarrhea — loose, watery and possibly more-frequent passage of stool — is a common problem. • Sometimes, it's the only symptom of a condition. • At other times, it may be associated with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or weight loss. • Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. • But when diarrhea lasts beyond a few days, it is usually a clue to another problem — such as medicine side effects, changes in diet, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or a more serious disorder, including ongoing infection, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms associated with loose, watery stools, also called diarrhea, may include: Belly cramps or pain. • Bloating. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Fever. • Blood in the stool. • Mucus in the stool. • Urgent need to pass stool. • If you're an adult, see your doctor if: Your diarrhea doesn't get better or stop after two days. • You become dehydrated. • You have terrible abdominal or rectal pain. • You have bloody or black stools. • You have a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). • In children, particularly young children, diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration. • Call your doctor if your child's diarrhea doesn't improve within 24 hours or if your child: Becomes dehydrated. • Has a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). • Has bloody or black stools. • A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including: Viruses. • Viruses that can cause diarrhea include Norwalk virus, also known as norovirus, enteric adenoviruses, astrovirus, cytomegalovirus and viruses that cause hepatitis. • Rotavirus is a common cause of sudden childhood diarrhea. • The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also has been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. • Bacteria and parasites. • Exposure to certain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, or parasites through contaminated food or water can lead to diarrhea. • When traveling in developing countries, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is often called traveler's diarrhea. • Clostridioides difficile, also known as C. diff, is another bacterium that causes diarrhea, and it can occur after a course of antibiotics or during a hospital stay. • Medicines. • Many medicines, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea. • Antibiotics get rid of infections by killing bacteria that cause illness, but they also kill good bacteria that are helpful in the body. • This disturbs the natural balance of bacteria in the intestines, leading to diarrhea or an infection such as C. diff. • Other medicines that cause diarrhea are anticancer drugs and antacids with magnesium. • Lactose intolerance. • Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. • People who have trouble digesting lactose often have diarrhea after eating dairy products. • Lactose intolerance can increase with age because levels of the enzyme that helps digest lactose become lower as people get older. • Fructose. • Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey. • It's sometimes added as a sweetener to certain beverages. • Fructose can lead to diarrhea in people who have trouble digesting it. • Artificial sweeteners. • Sorbitol, erythritol and mannitol — nonabsorbable sugars used as artificial sweeteners in chewing gum and other sugar-free products — can cause diarrhea in some otherwise healthy people. • Surgery. • Partial intestine or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea. • Other digestive disorders. • Chronic diarrhea has a number of other causes, such as IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). • Some common risk factors for diarrhea include: Exposure to viruses, bacteria or parasites. • This is a major risk factor for sudden onset of diarrhea. • Diet. • Certain foods or drinks, including coffee, tea, dairy products, or foods containing artificial sweeteners can cause diarrhea in some people. • Medicines. • Some medicines, such as antibiotics, laxatives, magnesium supplements, antidepressants, NSAIDs, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, can cause diarrhea. • Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can be life-threatening if not treated. • Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems. • If you have symptoms of serious dehydration, seek medical help. • These include: Excessive thirst. • Dry mouth or skin. • Little or no urination. • Weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness. • Fatigue. • Dark-colored urine. • These include: Not having a wet diaper in three or more hours. • Dry mouth and tongue. • Fever above 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius). • Crying without tears. • Drowsiness, unresponsiveness or irritability. • Sunken appearance to the belly, eyes or cheeks. • Wash your hands to prevent the spread of infectious diarrhea. • To ensure adequate hand-washing: Wash frequently. • Wash your hands before and after preparing food. • And wash your hands after handling uncooked meat, using the toilet, changing diapers, sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose. • Lather with soap for at least 20 seconds. • After putting soap on your hands, rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds. • This is about as long as it takes to sing \"Happy Birthday\" two times. • Use hand sanitizer when washing isn't possible. • Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you can't get to a sink. • Apply the hand sanitizer as you would hand lotion, making sure to cover the front and back of both hands. • Use a product that contains at least 60% alcohol. • You can help protect your infant from rotavirus, the most common cause of viral diarrhea in children, with one of two approved vaccines. • Ask your baby's doctor about having your baby vaccinated. • Diarrhea commonly affects people who travel to countries with poor sanitation and contaminated food. • To reduce your risk: Watch what you eat. • Eat hot, well-cooked foods. • Don't eat raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meats and dairy foods. • Watch what you drink. • Drink bottled water, soda, beer or wine served in its original container. • Don't drink tap water or use ice cubes. • Use bottled water even for brushing your teeth. • Keep your mouth closed while you shower. • Beverages made with boiled water, such as coffee and tea, are probably safe. • Remember that alcohol and caffeine can aggravate diarrhea and worsen dehydration. • Ask your health care team about antibiotics. • If you're traveling to a developing country for an extended time, ask a member of your healthcare team about getting antibiotics before you go, especially if you have a weakened immune system. • Check for travel warnings. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a travelers' health website where disease warnings are posted for various countries. • If you're planning to travel outside of the United States, check there for warnings and tips for reducing your risk.",

      "Overview": "DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a condition caused when a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. • This deletion causes several body systems to develop poorly. • The term 22q11.2 deletion syndrome covers terms once thought to be different conditions. • These terms include DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial (vel-oh-cahr-dee-oh-fay-shell) syndrome and other conditions caused by the same missing part of chromosome 22. • But features may vary slightly. • Medical problems commonly related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome include heart problems, lowered immunity, a cleft palate, complications from low levels of calcium, various eye issues and autoimmune disorders. • Complications also include hearing loss, skeletal differences, kidney and genital differences, and delayed development with behavioral and emotional problems. • The number and severity of symptoms related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome vary. • But specialists in various fields need to treat almost everyone with this syndrome.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can vary based on what body systems are affected and the severity of the problems. • Some symptoms may be clear at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or as a young child, or as an adult. • Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome may include: Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis. • Frequent infections. • Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. • Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. • This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest. • A gap in the roof of the mouth, also known as a cleft palate, or other problems with the palate. • A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems. • Hearing loss. • Poor muscle tone. • Kidney problems. • Poor vision and other eye problems. • Low levels of calcium in the blood. • Scoliosis. • Other symptoms may include: Delayed growth. • Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones. • Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech. • Learning delays or disabilities. • Behavioral problems. • Other conditions may cause symptoms like 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. • It's important to get the right diagnosis quickly if your child shows any symptoms listed above. • Healthcare professionals may suspect 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: At birth. • If a severe heart problem, cleft palate or other signs typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are clear at birth, tests likely will be done before your child leaves the hospital. • At well-baby visits. • Illnesses or conditions that are typical of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may become clear over time. • Your child's healthcare professional may see issues during regularly scheduled well-baby visits or annual checkups.",
      "Causes": "Each person has two copies of chromosome 22 — one inherited from each parent. • If a person has DiGeorge syndrome, one copy of chromosome 22 is missing a segment that includes an estimated 30 to 40 genes. • Many of these genes haven't been clearly identified and aren't well understood. • The region of chromosome 22 that's deleted is known as 22q11.2. • The deletion of genes from chromosome 22 usually occurs as a random event in the father's sperm or in the mother's egg. • Or it may occur early when the baby is developing. • Rarely, the deletion is passed to a child from a parent who also has a deletion in chromosome 22 but may have fewer or mild symptoms.",
      "Risk factors": "Babies who are missing a portion of chromosome 22, specifically a region known as 22q11.2, are most at risk of DiGeorge syndrome. • This missing portion causes several body systems to develop poorly.",
      "Complications": "The portions of chromosome 22 missing in DiGeorge syndrome affect the development of several body systems. • As a result, the condition can cause several errors during fetal development. • Heart issues. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome often causes heart problems that could lead to too little oxygen-rich blood. • For example, problems may include a hole between the lower chambers of the heart, also known as a ventricular septal defect. • Or there may be only one large vessel rather than two vessels leading out of the heart, also known as truncus arteriosus. • Or there may be four problems with heart structure, also known as tetralogy of Fallot. • Hypoparathyroidism. • The four parathyroid glands in the neck regulate the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can cause parathyroid glands to be smaller than usual and produce too little parathyroid hormone. • This leads to hypoparathyroidism. • This condition results in low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the blood. • Thymus gland dysfunction. • The thymus gland, which is beneath the breastbone, is where T cells — a type of white blood cell — mature. • Mature T cells help fight infections. • In children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, the thymus gland may be small or missing. • This leads to poor immune function and frequent, severe infections. • Cleft palate. • A common condition of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a cleft palate, which is an opening in the roof of the mouth, with or without a cleft lip. • Other, less visible problems with the structure of the palate can make it hard to swallow or make certain sounds in speech. • Distinct facial features. • A number of particular facial features may be present in some people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. • These may include small, low-set ears, short width of eye openings (palpebral fissures), hooded eyes, a relatively long face, an enlarged nose tip (bulbous), or a short or flattened groove in the upper lip. • Learning, behavioral and mental health problems. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may cause problems with development and function of the brain, resulting in learning, social, developmental or behavioral problems. • Delays in toddler speech development and finding it hard to learn are common. • Some children develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity condition (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder. • Later in life, the risk of depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions is higher. • Autoimmune conditions. • People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome also may have a greater risk of getting autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves' disease. • Other problems. • Many medical conditions may be related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, such as hearing problems, eye problems and poor kidney function.",
      "Prevention": "In some cases, an affected parent may pass DiGeorge syndrome to a child. • If you're worried about a family history of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome or if you already have a child with the syndrome, you may want to see a doctor who specializes in genetic conditions. • This doctor is called a geneticist. • Or you may want to see a genetic counselor to help plan future pregnancies."

      "Overview": "A dislocated shoulder is an injury in which the upper arm bone pops out of the cup-shaped socket that's part of the shoulder blade. • The shoulder is the body's most flexible joint, which makes it more likely to dislocate. • If you suspect a dislocated shoulder, seek prompt medical attention. • Most people regain full use of their shoulder within a few weeks. • However, once a shoulder dislocates, the joint might be prone to repeat dislocations.",
      "Symptoms": "Dislocated shoulder symptoms can include: A visibly deformed or out-of-place shoulder Swelling or bruising Intense pain Inability to move the joint Shoulder dislocation can also cause numbness, weakness or tingling near the injury, such as in the neck or down the arm. • The muscles in the shoulder might spasm, which can increase the pain. • Get medical help right away for a shoulder that appears dislocated. • While waiting for medical attention: Don't move the joint. • Splint or sling the shoulder joint in the position it's in. • Don't try to move the shoulder or force it back into place. • This can damage the shoulder joint and its surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels. • Ice the injured joint. • Apply ice to the shoulder to help reduce pain and swelling.",
      "Causes": "The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated joint of the body. • Because it moves in several directions, the shoulder can dislocate forward, backward or downward. • It might dislocate completely or partially. • Most dislocations occur through the front of the shoulder. • The ligaments — tissue that joins the bones — of the shoulder can be stretched or torn, often making the dislocation worse. • It takes a strong force, such as a sudden blow to the shoulder, to pull the bones out of place. • Extreme twisting of the shoulder joint can pop the ball of the upper arm bone out of the shoulder socket. • In a partial dislocation, the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the shoulder socket. • Causes of a dislocated shoulder include: Sports injuries. • Shoulder dislocation is a common injury in contact sports, such as football and hockey. • It's also common in sports that might involve falls, such as downhill skiing, gymnastics and volleyball. • Trauma not related to sports. • A hard blow to the shoulder during a motor vehicle accident can cause dislocation. • Falls. • Landing awkwardly after a fall, such as from a ladder or from tripping on a loose rug, can dislocate a shoulder.",
      "Risk factors": "Anyone can dislocate a shoulder. • However, dislocated shoulders occur most often in people in their teens and 20s, particularly athletes involved in contact sports.",
      "Complications": "Complications of a dislocated shoulder might include: Tearing of the muscles, ligaments and tendons that reinforce the shoulder joint Nerve or blood vessel damage in or around the shoulder joint Becoming more prone to repeat dislocations, especially if the injury is severe Stretched or torn ligaments or tendons in the shoulder or damaged nerves or blood vessels around the shoulder might require surgery for repair.",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent a dislocated shoulder: Take care to avoid falls and other shoulder injuries Wear protective gear when playing contact sports Exercise regularly to maintain strength and flexibility in joints and muscles Having a dislocated shoulder joint can increase the risk of future shoulder dislocations. • To help avoid a recurrence, keep doing the strength and stability exercises prescribed for the injury."

      "Overview": "Dissociative disorders are mental health conditions that involve experiencing a loss of connection between thoughts, memories, feelings, surroundings, behavior and identity. • These conditions include escape from reality in ways that are not wanted and not healthy. • This causes problems in managing everyday life. • Dissociative disorders usually arise as a reaction to shocking, distressing or painful events and help push away difficult memories. • Symptoms depend in part on the type of dissociative disorder and can range from memory loss to disconnected identities. • Times of stress can worsen symptoms for a while, making them easier to see. • Treatment for dissociative disorders may include talk therapy, also called psychotherapy, and medicine. • Treating dissociative disorders can be difficult, but many people learn new ways of coping and their lives get better.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorder, but may include: A sense of being separated from yourself and your emotions. • Thinking that people and things around you are distorted and not real. • A blurred sense of your own identity. • Severe stress or problems in relationships, work or other important areas of life. • Not being able to cope well with emotional or work-related stress. • Memory loss, also called amnesia, of certain time periods, events, people and personal information. • Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. • The American Psychiatric Association defines three major dissociative disorders: Depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder. • Depersonalization involves a sense of separation from yourself or feeling like you're outside of yourself. • You may feel as if you're seeing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance, like you're watching a movie. • Derealization involves feeling that other people and things are separate from you and seem foggy or dreamlike. • Time may seem to slow down or speed up. • The world may seem unreal. • You may go through depersonalization, derealization or both. • Symptoms, which can be very distressing, may last hours, days, weeks or months. • They may come and go over many years. • Or they may become ongoing. • The main symptom of dissociative amnesia is memory loss that's more severe than usual forgetfulness. • The memory loss can't be explained by a medical condition. • You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a time when you felt shock, distress or pain. • A bout of dissociative amnesia usually occurs suddenly. • It may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. • Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat. • More rarely, it can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. • It sometimes may involve travel or confused wandering away from your life. • This confused wandering is called dissociative fugue. • Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder involves \"switching\" to other identities. • You may feel as if you have two or more people talking or living inside your head. • You may feel like you're possessed by other identities. • Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and features. • These identities sometimes include differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. • There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. • Dissociative identity disorder usually also includes bouts of amnesia and often includes times of confused wandering. • Sometimes dissociative disorder symptoms occur in a crisis with severe or impulsive behavior. • People with these symptoms need care more urgently and in an emergency department at a hospital when safety becomes a concern. • If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may be a dissociative disorder, contact your doctor or other health care professional for help. • If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number right away or go to an emergency department. • Share your concerns with a trusted relative or friend. • Or contact a suicide hotline: In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. • Or use the Lifeline Chat at 988lifeline.org/chat/. • Services are free and confidential. • If you're a U.S. veteran or service member in crisis, call 988 and then press 1, or text 838255. • Or chat using veteranscrisisline.net/get-help-now/chat/. • The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454. • Dissociative disorders usually start as a way to cope with shocking, distressing or painful events. • The disorders most often form in children who go through long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse. • Less often, the disorders form in children who've lived in a home where they went through frightening times or they never knew what to expect. • The stress of war or natural disasters also can bring on dissociative disorders. • When you go through an event that's too much to handle emotionally, you may feel like you're stepping outside of yourself and seeing the event as if it's happening to another person. • Mentally escaping in this way may help you get through a shocking, distressing or painful time. • You're at greatest risk of having a dissociative disorder if you've had long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse during childhood. • Other shocking, distressing or painful events also may cause dissociative disorders to arise. • These may include war, natural disasters, kidnapping, torture, extensive early-life medical procedures or other events. • Having a dissociative disorder increases the risk of complications and having other mental health conditions. • These may include: Depression and anxiety. • Post-traumatic stress disorder. • Sleep disorders, including nightmares, insomnia and sleepwalking. • Physical symptoms such as lightheadedness or seizures that are not due to epilepsy. • Eating disorders. • Problems with sexual function. • Problems with alcohol and drug use. • Personality disorders. • Major problems in personal relationships, at school and at work. • Self-injury or high-risk behavior. • Suicidal thoughts and behavior. • Children who are physically, emotionally or sexually abused are at increased risk of developing mental health conditions, such as dissociative disorders. • If stress or other personal issues are affecting the way you treat your child, seek help. • Talk to a trusted person such as a friend, your health care professional or a leader in your faith community. • Ask for help finding resources such as parenting support groups and family therapists. • Look for churches, other faith-based groups and community education programs that offer parenting classes that also may help you learn a healthier parenting style. • If you or your child was abused or went through another shocking, distressing or painful event, see a doctor or other health care professional right away. • Your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional who can help you or your child recover and learn healthy coping skills. • Or you may be able to contact mental health services directly.",

      "Overview": "Diverticulitis is inflammation of irregular bulging pouches in the wall of the large intestine. • Typically, the wall of the large intestine, also called the colon, is smooth. • An irregular, bulging pouch in the colon wall is called a diverticulum. • Multiple pouches are called diverticula. • Diverticula are common, especially after age 50. • They are usually found in the lower part of the colon. • Most often, they don't cause problems. • The presence of diverticula is called diverticulosis. • Diverticulosis isn't a disease condition. • When these pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. • Inflammation is immune system activity that increases blood flow and fluids to a site in the body and delivers disease-fighting cells. • Inflammation of diverticula can cause severe pain, fever, nausea and changes in your stool habits. • Mild diverticulitis is usually treated with rest, changes in your diet and possibly antibiotics. • Severe diverticulitis usually needs antibiotic treatment in the hospital. • Surgery may be needed for severe or frequent diverticulitis.",
      "Symptoms": "A common symptom of diverticulitis is pain in the area below the chest called the abdomen. • Most often, pain is in the lower left abdomen. • Pain from diverticulitis is usually sudden and intense. • Pain may be mild and gradually worsen, or the intensity of the pain may vary over time. • Other signs and symptoms of diverticulitis may include: Nausea. • Fever. • Tenderness in the abdomen when touched. • Changes in stool, including sudden diarrhea or constipation. • Get medical care anytime you have constant, unexplained abdominal pain, particularly if you also have a fever and notable changes in stools. • Diverticula gradually develop over time in the walls of the colon. • They are common in older adults. • Pressure in the colon — possibly from spasms or straining — may cause diverticula to form where the wall of the colon is weak. • Diverticulitis is inflammation of one or more diverticula. • This may happen because of bacterial disease or damage to diverticula tissues. • Diverticulitis is more common among people over 50. • Other factors that increase the risk of diverticulitis include: Obesity. • Smoking. • A diet of low-fiber foods. • A diet high in red meat. • Heavy alcohol use. • Lack of exercise. • Low vitamin D levels. • Certain medicines, such as steroids, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). • About 15 percent of people with diverticulitis develop complications. • These may include: A pocket of pus from bacterial disease, called an abscess. • Blockage of the colon. • An irregular passageway, called a fistula, between the bowel and another organ in the body. • A tear in the colon wall that allows waste to spill out, causing serious disease of the abdomen lining, called peritonitis. • Bleeding from ruptured blood vessels, also called diverticular hemorrhage. • To help prevent diverticulitis: Exercise regularly. • Regular, vigorous exercise decreases the risk of diverticulitis. • Eat a high-fiber diet. • A high-fiber diet improves the movement of waste through the colon and decreases the risk of diverticulitis. • Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seeds and beans. • Cut back on red meats and sweets. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Talk to your healthcare professional or a dietitian about goals for a healthy weight for you and strategies to reach your goals. • Drink plenty of fluids. • Fiber works by absorbing water and increasing the soft, bulky waste in your colon. • Drinking fluids improves the movement of waste and prevents constipation. • Quit smoking and limit alcohol use. • Smoking and heavy alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis. • In the past, healthcare professionals recommended that people with diverticulitis avoid nuts, seeds and popcorn. • Studies have shown that these foods do not increase the risk of diverticulitis. • Seeds and some nuts are good sources of fiber.",

      "Overview": "Dizziness is a term that people use to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or wobbly. • The sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is more precisely termed vertigo. • Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults see a healthcare professional. • Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can have serious effects on your life. • But dizziness rarely means that you have a life-threatening condition. • Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. • Treatment often helps, but the symptoms may come back.",
      "Symptoms": "People who have bouts of dizziness may describe symptoms such as: A sense of motion or spinning, also called vertigo. • Lightheadedness or feeling faint. • A loss of balance or the sense of not feeling steady. • A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness. • These feelings may be triggered or made worse by walking, standing up or moving your head. • Your dizziness may happen along with an upset stomach. • Or your dizziness may be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. • The bout may last seconds or days, and it may come back. • In general, see your healthcare professional if you have any repeated, sudden, severe, or long-lasting dizziness or vertigo with no clear cause. • Get emergency medical care if you have new, severe dizziness or vertigo along with any of the following: Pain such as a sudden, severe headache or chest pain. • Rapid or irregular heartbeat. • Loss of feeling or movement in the arms or legs, stumbling or trouble walking, or loss of feeling or weakness in the face. • Trouble breathing. • Fainting or seizures. • Trouble with the eyes or ears, such as double vision or a sudden change in hearing. • Confusion or slurred speech. • Ongoing vomiting. • Dizziness has many possible causes. • These include conditions that affect the inner ear, motion sickness and medicine side effects. • Very rarely, dizziness may be caused by a condition such as poor circulation, infection or injury. • The way dizziness makes you feel and the things that trigger it for you provide clues about possible causes. • How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms that you have also can help healthcare professionals pinpoint the cause. • Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. • These include your: Eyes, which help you figure out where your body is in space and how it's moving. • Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions. • Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion. • Vertigo is the sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. • With inner ear conditions, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that don't match what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. • Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. • Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). • This condition causes an intense and brief sense that you're spinning or moving. • These bouts are triggered by a rapid change in head movement. • These changes in head movement can happen when you turn over in bed, sit up or get hit in the head. • BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. • Viral infection. • A viral infection called vestibular neuritis can cause intense, constant vertigo. • It's an infection of the main nerve that leads from the inner ear to the brain, called the vestibular nerve. • If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have a condition called labyrinthitis. • It can be caused by a virus, and it affects the nerve in the brain that controls balance and hearing. • Migraine. • People who get migraines may have bouts of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having bad headaches. • Such vertigo bouts can last minutes to hours. • They may be linked with headache as well as with being sensitive to light and noise. • Meniere's disease. • This rare disease involves the buildup of too much fluid in the inner ear. • It causes sudden bouts of vertigo that can last for hours. • It also can cause hearing loss that may come and go, ringing in the ear, and the feeling of a plugged ear. • You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if too little blood reaches your brain. • Causes include: Drop in blood pressure. • A form of low blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension may make you briefly feel faint or dizzy. • This type of low blood pressure happens after sitting up or standing too quickly. • Poor blood flow. • Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, irregular heartbeat and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. • Also, a drop in the total amount of blood flowing through the body may cause the brain or inner ear not to receive enough blood. • Dizziness may result from conditions or circumstances like these: Nervous system conditions. • Some conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord or parts of the body controlled by nerves can lead to a loss of balance that becomes worse over time. • These conditions include Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. • Medicines. • Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medicines. • These include anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. • Medicines that lower blood pressure may cause faintness if they lower blood pressure too much. • Anxiety disorders. • Certain types of anxiety may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. • These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces. • This fear is called agoraphobia. • Anemia. • There are several conditions that result in having too few healthy red blood cells, also called anemia. • Other symptoms that may happen along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. • Low blood sugar. • Another name for this is hypoglycemia. • This condition usually happens in people with diabetes who use insulin to help lower blood sugar. • Dizziness may happen along with sweating and anxiety. • If you have missed a meal and are hungry, that may cause unpleasant symptoms, but this is not considered hypoglycemia. • Carbon monoxide poisoning. • Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often described as flu-like. • The symptoms include headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. • Overheating or not enough hydration. • If you're active in hot weather or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating or from not being hydrated enough. • The risk is even higher if you take certain heart medicines. • Factors that may raise your risk of getting dizzy include: Age. • Older adults are more likely to have health conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of less balance. • They're also more likely to take medicines that can cause dizziness. • A past bout of dizziness. • If you've had dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. • Dizziness can lead to other health concerns called complications. • For instance, it can raise your risk of falling and hurting yourself. • Getting dizzy while driving a car or running heavy machinery can make an accident more likely. • You also may have long-term complications if you don't get treatment for a health condition that may be causing your dizziness.",
      "Causes": "Dizziness has many possible causes. • These include conditions that affect the inner ear, motion sickness and medicine side effects. • Very rarely, dizziness may be caused by a condition such as poor circulation, infection or injury. • The way dizziness makes you feel and the things that trigger it for you provide clues about possible causes. • How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms that you have also can help healthcare professionals pinpoint the cause. • Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. • These include your: Eyes, which help you figure out where your body is in space and how it's moving. • Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions. • Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion. • Vertigo is the sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. • With inner ear conditions, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that don't match what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. • Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. • Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). • This condition causes an intense and brief sense that you're spinning or moving. • These bouts are triggered by a rapid change in head movement. • These changes in head movement can happen when you turn over in bed, sit up or get hit in the head. • BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. • Viral infection. • A viral infection called vestibular neuritis can cause intense, constant vertigo. • It's an infection of the main nerve that leads from the inner ear to the brain, called the vestibular nerve. • If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have a condition called labyrinthitis. • It can be caused by a virus, and it affects the nerve in the brain that controls balance and hearing. • Migraine. • People who get migraines may have bouts of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having bad headaches. • Such vertigo bouts can last minutes to hours. • They may be linked with headache as well as with being sensitive to light and noise. • Meniere's disease. • This rare disease involves the buildup of too much fluid in the inner ear. • It causes sudden bouts of vertigo that can last for hours. • It also can cause hearing loss that may come and go, ringing in the ear, and the feeling of a plugged ear. • You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if too little blood reaches your brain. • Causes include: Drop in blood pressure. • A form of low blood pressure called orthostatic hypotension may make you briefly feel faint or dizzy. • This type of low blood pressure happens after sitting up or standing too quickly. • Poor blood flow. • Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, irregular heartbeat and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. • Also, a drop in the total amount of blood flowing through the body may cause the brain or inner ear not to receive enough blood. • Dizziness may result from conditions or circumstances like these: Nervous system conditions. • Some conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord or parts of the body controlled by nerves can lead to a loss of balance that becomes worse over time. • These conditions include Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. • Medicines. • Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medicines. • These include anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. • Medicines that lower blood pressure may cause faintness if they lower blood pressure too much. • Anxiety disorders. • Certain types of anxiety may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. • These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces. • This fear is called agoraphobia. • Anemia. • There are several conditions that result in having too few healthy red blood cells, also called anemia. • Other symptoms that may happen along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin. • Low blood sugar. • Another name for this is hypoglycemia. • This condition usually happens in people with diabetes who use insulin to help lower blood sugar. • Dizziness may happen along with sweating and anxiety. • If you have missed a meal and are hungry, that may cause unpleasant symptoms, but this is not considered hypoglycemia. • Carbon monoxide poisoning. • Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often described as flu-like. • The symptoms include headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. • Overheating or not enough hydration. • If you're active in hot weather or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating or from not being hydrated enough. • The risk is even higher if you take certain heart medicines.",

      "Overview": "A double uterus is a rare condition that is present at birth in some women. • In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. • As the fetus grows, the tubes typically join to create one larger, hollow organ. • This organ is the uterus. • Sometimes the tubes don't join completely. • Instead, each one develops into a separate organ. • A double uterus may have one opening into one vagina. • This opening is called the cervix. • In other cases, each uterus has its own cervix. • Often, there's also a thin wall of tissue that runs down the length of the vagina. • This divides the vagina in two, with two separate openings. • Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies. • But the condition can make you more likely to have a miscarriage or premature birth.",
      "Symptoms": "A double uterus often causes no symptoms. • The condition may be discovered during a regular pelvic exam. • Or it may be found during imaging tests to find the cause of repeated miscarriages. • Women who have a double vagina along with a double uterus may first see a health care provider for menstrual bleeding that isn't stopped by a tampon. • This can happen when a tampon is placed in one vagina, but blood still flows from the second uterus and vagina. • Seek medical advice if you have a menstrual flow despite using a tampon. • Or if you have severe pain during your periods or you have repeated miscarriages. • Health experts don't know exactly why some fetuses develop a double uterus. • Genetics may play a role. • That's because this rare condition sometimes runs in families. • The risk factors for a double uterus are not well understood. • The cause of the condition isn't known either. • Genetics likely plays a role, along with other unknown factors. • Many women with a double uterus have active sex lives. • They also may have routine pregnancies and successful deliveries. • But sometimes a double uterus and other uterine factors can cause: Infertility. • Miscarriage. • Premature birth. • Kidney problems.",

      "Overview": "Down syndrome is a genetic condition caused when an unusual cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. • This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome. • The term \"syndrome\" refers to a set of symptoms that tend to happen together. • With a syndrome, there is a pattern of differences or problems. • The condition is named after an English physician, John Langdon Down, who first described it. • Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals. • The condition causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. • It's the most common genetic chromosomal cause of intellectual disabilities in children. • It also commonly causes other medical conditions, including heart and digestive system problems. • Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly improve the quality of life for children and adults with this condition and help them live fulfilling lives.",
      "Symptoms": "Each person with Down syndrome is an individual. • Problems with intellect and development are usually mild to moderate. • Some people are healthy while others have serious health issues such as heart problems that are present at birth. • Children and adults with Down syndrome have distinct face and body features. • Though not all people with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features include: Flattened face and small nose with a flat bridge. • Small head. • Short neck. • Tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth. • Upward slanting eyelids. • Skin fold of the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner of the eye. • Small, rounded ears. • Wide, small hands with a single crease in the palm and short fingers. • Small feet with a space between the first and second toes. • Tiny white spots on the colored part of the eye called the iris. • These white spots are called Brushfield's spots. • Short height. • Poor muscle tone in infancy. • Joints that are loose and too flexible. • Infants with Down syndrome may be average size, but typically they grow slowly and remain shorter than other children the same age. • Children with Down syndrome take longer to reach developmental milestones, such as sitting, talking and walking. • Occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech and language therapy can help improve physical functioning and speech. • Most children with Down syndrome have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. • This means that they have problems with memory, learning new things, focusing and thinking, or making decisions that affect their everyday life. • Language and speech are delayed. • Early intervention and special education services can help children and teens with Down syndrome reach their full potential. • Services for adults with Down syndrome can help support living a full life. • Down syndrome usually is diagnosed before or at birth. • But if you have any questions regarding your pregnancy or your child's growth and development, talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional. • Human cells usually contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. • One chromosome in each pair comes from the sperm, the other from the egg. • Down syndrome results from an unusual cell division involving chromosome 21. • This unusual cell division results in an extra partial or full chromosome 21. • This extra genetic material changes how the body and brain develop. • It is responsible for the physical features and developmental problems of Down syndrome. • Any one of three genetic changes can cause Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. • About 95% of the time, Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21. • This means the person has three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the usual two copies. • The extra chromosome 21 is in all cells in the body. • Trisomy 21 results from an unusual cell division during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell. • Mosaic Down syndrome. • This is a rare form of Down syndrome. • People with mosaic Down syndrome have only some cells with an extra copy of chromosome 21. • This mosaic of typical and changed cells is caused by an unusual cell division after the egg has been fertilized by the sperm. • Translocation Down syndrome. • In a small number of people, Down syndrome can occur when a part of chromosome 21 becomes attached, also called translocated, onto another chromosome. • This can happen before or at conception. • The person has the usual two copies of chromosome 21, but also has extra genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome. • Most of the time, Down syndrome is not passed down in families. • The condition is caused by a random unusual cell division. • This can happen during the development of the sperm cell or the egg cell or during early development of the baby in the womb. • Translocation Down syndrome can be passed from parent to child. • But only a small number of children with Down syndrome have translocation and only some of them inherited it from one of their parents. • Either parent may have a balanced translocation. • The parent has some rearranged genetic material from chromosome 21 on another chromosome, but no extra genetic material. • This means the parent has no signs of Down syndrome, but can pass an unbalanced translocation on to children, causing Down syndrome in the children. • Some parents have a greater risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. • Risk factors include: Older age. • Chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome goes up with age because older eggs have a greater risk of unusual chromosome division. • The risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases after a pregnant person is 35 years of age. • But most children with Down syndrome are born to pregnant people under age 35 because they have far more babies. • Being carriers of the genetic translocation for Down syndrome. • Either parent can pass the genetic translocation for Down syndrome on to their children. • Having had one child with Down syndrome. • Both parents who have one child with Down syndrome and parents who have a translocation themselves are at higher risk of having another child with Down syndrome. • A genetic counselor can help parents understand the risk of having a second child with Down syndrome. • Health concerns that result from having Down syndrome can be mild, moderate or severe. • Some children with Down syndrome are healthy, while others may have serious health problems. • Some health concerns may become more of a problem as the person gets older. • Health concerns can include: Heart problems. • About half the children with Down syndrome are born with some type of heart condition that is present at birth. • These heart problems can be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy. • Problems with the digestive system and digesting food. • Stomach and intestinal conditions occur in some children with Down syndrome. • These may include changes in the structure of the stomach and intestines. • There is a higher risk of developing digestive problems, such as intestinal blockage, heartburn called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or celiac disease. • Problems with the immune system. • Because of differences in their immune systems, people with Down syndrome are at higher risk of developing autoimmune disorders, some forms of cancer and infectious diseases such as pneumonia. • Sleep apnea. • Soft tissue and spinal changes can lead to blockage of the airways. • Children and adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea. • Being overweight. • People with Down syndrome are more likely to be overweight or obese compared with the general population. • Spinal problems. • In some people with Down syndrome, the top two vertebrae in the neck may not line up as they should. • This is called atlantoaxial instability. • The condition puts people at risk of serious injury to the spinal cord from activities that bend the neck too far. • Some examples of these activities include contact sports and horseback riding. • Leukemia. • Young children with Down syndrome have a higher risk of leukemia. • Alzheimer's disease. • Having Down syndrome greatly raises the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. • Also, dementia often occurs at an earlier age than in the general population. • Symptoms may begin around age 50. • Other problems. • Down syndrome also may also be linked with other health conditions, such as thyroid problems, dental problems, seizures, ear infections, and hearing and vision problems. • Conditions such as depression, anxiety, autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also may be more common. • Over the years, there have been advances in healthcare for children and adults with Down syndrome. • Because of these advances, children born today with Down syndrome are likely to live a longer life than in the past. • People with Down syndrome can expect to live more than 60 years, depending on how severe their health problems are. • There's no way to prevent Down syndrome. • If you're at higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome or you already have one child with Down syndrome, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant. • A genetic counselor can help you understand your chances of having a child with Down syndrome. • The counselor also can explain the prenatal tests that are available and help explain the pros and cons of testing.",

      "Overview": "Dressler syndrome is swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart that happens after damage to the heart muscle. • The damage may trigger an immune system response that causes the condition. • The damage can result from a heart attack, heart surgery or a serious injury. • Symptoms of Dressler syndrome include chest pain that can feel like chest pain from a heart attack. • Swelling and irritation of the sac around the heart is called pericarditis. • Dressler syndrome is a type of pericarditis that can start after the heart muscle is damaged. • So you may hear Dressler syndrome called post-traumatic pericarditis. • Some other names for the condition are: Post-myocardial infarction syndrome. • Post-cardiac injury syndrome. • Post-pericardiotomy syndrome.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of Dressler syndrome are likely to start weeks to a few months after a heart attack, surgery or injury to the chest. • Symptoms can include: Chest pain, which may get worse with deep breaths. • Fever. • Shortness of breath. • Get emergency care for sudden or ongoing chest pain. • This can be a symptom of a heart attack or another serious condition.",
      "Causes": "Experts think Dressler syndrome is caused by the immune system's response to heart damage. • The body reacts to the injured tissue by sending immune cells and proteins called antibodies to clean up and repair the affected area. • Sometimes this response causes swelling due to the inflammation in the sac around the heart that's known as the pericardium. • Dressler syndrome can happen after a heart attack or some heart surgeries or procedures. • It also can happen after a serious injury to the chest, such as trauma from a car accident.",
      "Risk factors": "Damage to the heart muscle increases the risk of Dressler syndrome. • Some things that cause heart muscle are: Chest injury. • Some types of heart surgery. • Heart attack.",
      "Complications": "A complication of Dressler syndrome is fluid buildup in the tissues surrounding the lungs called pleural effusion. • Rarely, Dressler syndrome can cause more-serious complications, including: Cardiac tamponade. • Swelling of the pericardium can cause fluid to build up in the sac. • The fluid can put pressure on the heart. • The pressure forces the heart to work harder, and the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. • Constrictive pericarditis. • Swelling that's ongoing or that keeps coming back can cause the pericardium to become thick or scarred. • The scarring can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood.",
      "Prevention": "Some studies suggest that taking the anti-inflammatory medicine colchicine (Colcrys, Gloperba, others) soon after heart surgery may help prevent Dressler syndrome."

      "Overview": "Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine. • Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. • When you're addicted, you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes. • Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some people, the drug use becomes more frequent. • For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins when they take prescribed medicines or receive them from others who have prescriptions. • The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. • Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. • As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. • Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. • As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. • Attempts to stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill. • These are called withdrawal symptoms. • Help from your health care provider, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program can help you overcome your drug addiction and stay drug-free.",
      "Symptoms": "Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others: Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. • Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include: Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to support drug use Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. • Below you'll find several examples. • People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. • Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. • Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Major cravings for certain foods at unusual times Long-term use is often associated with: Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Ongoing cough and frequent lung infections Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. • The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. • Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. • A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. • Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than \"natural\" or harmless products. • These drugs can produce a \"high\" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. • Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: A sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Violent behavior Substituted cathinones, also called \"bath salts,\" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. • Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. • Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. • Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. • These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. • Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling \"high\" Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. • They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to \"switch off\" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings. • Barbiturates. • An example is phenobarbital. • Benzodiazepines. • Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). • Hypnotics. • Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata). • Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). • They're often used and misused in search of a \"high,\" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. • Signs and symptoms of recent use can include: Feeling of happy excitement and too much confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Poor judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (\"meth mouth\") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. • Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. • Other examples include ketamine and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol — a brand used outside the U.S. — also called roofie. • These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. • Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. • Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include: Hallucinations Paranoia Larger than usual pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. • The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). • LSD use may cause: Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations — even years later PCP use may cause: A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Poor judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. • Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. • Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. • Signs and symptoms of use can include: Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief happy excitement Behaving as if drunk Reduced ability to keep impulses under control Aggressive behavior or eagerness to fight Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. • This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone. • Sometimes called the \"opioid epidemic,\" addiction to opioid prescription pain medicines has reached an alarming rate across the United States. • Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. • Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include: A sense of feeling \"high\" Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Pupils that are smaller than usual Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs) Needle marks (if injecting drugs) If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. • The sooner you seek help, the greater your chances for a long-term recovery. • Talk with your health care provider or see a mental health provider, such as a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. • Make an appointment to see a provider if: You can't stop using a drug You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use If you're not ready to approach a health care provider or mental health professional, help lines or hotlines may be a good place to learn about treatment. • You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book. • Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and: May have overdosed Shows changes in consciousness Has trouble breathing Has seizures or convulsions Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug People struggling with addiction usually deny they have a problem and hesitate to seek treatment. • An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and can motivate someone to seek or accept help. • It's important to plan an intervention carefully. • It may be done by family and friends in consultation with a health care provider or mental health professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. • It involves family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction. • During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person about the consequences of addiction. • Then they ask the person to accept treatment. • Like many mental health disorders, several factors may contribute to development of drug addiction. • The main factors are: Environment. • Environmental factors, including your family's beliefs and attitudes and exposure to a peer group that encourages drug use, seem to play a role in initial drug use. • Genetics. • Once you've started using a drug, the development into addiction may be influenced by inherited (genetic) traits, which may delay or speed up the disease progression. • Physical addiction appears to occur when repeated use of a drug changes the way your brain feels pleasure. • The addicting drug causes physical changes to some nerve cells (neurons) in your brain. • Neurons use chemicals called neurotransmitters to communicate. • These changes can remain long after you stop using the drug. • People of any age, sex or economic status can become addicted to a drug. • Certain factors can affect the likelihood and speed of developing an addiction: Family history of addiction. • Drug addiction is more common in some families and likely involves an increased risk based on genes. • If you have a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with alcohol or drug addiction, you're at greater risk of developing a drug addiction. • Mental health disorder. • If you have a mental health disorder such as depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or post-traumatic stress disorder, you're more likely to become addicted to drugs. • Using drugs can become a way of coping with painful feelings, such as anxiety, depression and loneliness, and can make these problems even worse. • Peer pressure. • Peer pressure is a strong factor in starting to use and misuse drugs, particularly for young people. • Lack of family involvement. • Difficult family situations or lack of a bond with your parents or siblings may increase the risk of addiction, as can a lack of parental supervision. • Early use. • Using drugs at an early age can cause changes in the developing brain and increase the likelihood of progressing to drug addiction. • Taking a highly addictive drug. • Some drugs, such as stimulants, cocaine or opioid painkillers, may result in faster development of addiction than other drugs. • Smoking or injecting drugs can increase the potential for addiction. • Taking drugs considered less addicting — so-called \"light drugs\" — can start you on a pathway of drug use and addiction. • Drug use can have significant and damaging short-term and long-term effects. • Taking some drugs can be particularly risky, especially if you take high doses or combine them with other drugs or alcohol. • Here are some examples. • Methamphetamine, opiates and cocaine are highly addictive and cause multiple short-term and long-term health consequences, including psychotic behavior, seizures or death due to overdose. • Opioid drugs affect the part of the brain that controls breathing, and overdose can result in death. • Taking opioids with alcohol increases this risk. • GHB and flunitrazepam may cause sedation, confusion and memory loss. • These so-called \"date rape drugs\" are known to impair the ability to resist unwanted contact and recollection of the event. • At high doses, they can cause seizures, coma and death. • The danger increases when these drugs are taken with alcohol. • MDMA — also known as molly or ecstasy — can interfere with the body's ability to regulate temperature. • A severe spike in body temperature can result in liver, kidney or heart failure and death. • Other complications can include severe dehydration, leading to seizures. • Long-term, MDMA can damage the brain. • One particular danger of club drugs is that the liquid, pill or powder forms of these drugs available on the street often contain unknown substances that can be harmful, including other illegally manufactured or pharmaceutical drugs. • Due to the toxic nature of inhalants, users may develop brain damage of different levels of severity. • Sudden death can occur even after a single exposure. • Dependence on drugs can create a number of dangerous and damaging complications, including: Getting an infectious disease. • People who are addicted to a drug are more likely to get an infectious disease, such as HIV, either through unsafe sex or by sharing needles with others. • Other health problems. • Drug addiction can lead to a range of both short-term and long-term mental and physical health problems. • These depend on what drug is taken. • Accidents. • People who are addicted to drugs are more likely to drive or do other dangerous activities while under the influence. • Suicide. • People who are addicted to drugs die by suicide more often than people who aren't addicted. • Family problems. • Behavioral changes may cause relationship or family conflict and custody issues. • Work issues. • Drug use can cause declining performance at work, absenteeism and eventual loss of employment. • Problems at school. • Drug use can negatively affect academic performance and motivation to excel in school. • Legal issues. • Legal problems are common for drug users and can stem from buying or possessing illegal drugs, stealing to support the drug addiction, driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or disputes over child custody. • Financial problems. • Spending money to support drug use takes away money from other needs, could lead to debt, and can lead to illegal or unethical behaviors. • The best way to prevent an addiction to a drug is not to take the drug at all. • If your health care provider prescribes a drug with the potential for addiction, use care when taking the drug and follow instructions. • Health care providers should prescribe these medicines at safe doses and amounts and monitor their use so that you're not given too great a dose or for too long a time. • If you feel you need to take more than the prescribed dose of a medicine, talk to your health care provider. • Take these steps to help prevent drug misuse in your children and teenagers: Communicate. • Talk to your children about the risks of drug use and misuse. • Listen. • Be a good listener when your children talk about peer pressure and be supportive of their efforts to resist it. • Set a good example. • Don't misuse alcohol or addictive drugs. • Children of parents who misuse drugs are at greater risk of drug addiction. • Strengthen the bond. • Work on your relationship with your children. • A strong, stable bond between you and your child will reduce your child's risk of using or misusing drugs. • Once you've been addicted to a drug, you're at high risk of falling back into a pattern of addiction. • If you do start using the drug, it's likely you'll lose control over its use again — even if you've had treatment and you haven't used the drug for some time. • Follow your treatment plan. • Monitor your cravings. • It may seem like you've recovered and you don't need to keep taking steps to stay drug-free. • But your chances of staying drug-free will be much higher if you continue seeing your therapist or counselor, going to support group meetings and taking prescribed medicine. • Avoid high-risk situations. • Don't go back to the neighborhood where you used to get your drugs. • And stay away from your old drug crowd. • Get help immediately if you use the drug again. • If you start using the drug again, talk to your health care provider, your mental health provider or someone else who can help you right away.",

      "Overview": "A drug allergy is the reaction of the immune system to a medicine. • Any medicine — over-the-counter, prescription or herbal — can trigger a drug allergy. • However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medicines. • The most common symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash and fever. • But a drug allergy also may cause serious reactions. • This includes a severe, life-threatening condition known as anaphylaxis. • A drug allergy is not the same as a medicine side effect. • A side effect is a known possible reaction to a medicine. • Side effects to medicines are listed on their labels. • A drug allergy also is different from drug toxicity. • Drug toxicity is caused by an overdose of medicine.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of a serious drug allergy often happen within an hour after taking a medicine. • Other reactions, particularly rashes, can happen hours, days or weeks later. • Drug allergy symptoms may include: Skin rash. • Hives. • Itching. • Fever. • Swelling. • Shortness of breath. • Wheezing. • Runny nose. • Itchy, watery eyes. • Anaphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening drug allergy reaction that causes widespread changes in the way body systems function. • Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Tightening of the airways and throat, causing trouble breathing. • Nausea or belly cramps. • Vomiting or diarrhea. • Dizziness or lightheadedness. • Weak, fast pulse. • Drop in blood pressure. • Seizure. • Loss of consciousness. • Less common drug allergy reactions happen days or weeks after exposure to a medicine and may last for some time after you stop taking the medicine. • These include: Serum sickness, which may cause fever, joint pain, rash, swelling and nausea. • Drug-induced anemia, a reduction in red blood cells, which can cause fatigue, irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath and other symptoms. • Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, also called (DRESS), which results in rash, high white blood cell count, general swelling, swollen lymph nodes and hepatitis infection that comes back after being dormant. • Inflammation in the kidneys, also called nephritis, which can cause fever, blood in the urine, general swelling, confusion and other symptoms. • Call 911 or emergency medical help if you experience signs of a severe reaction or suspected anaphylaxis after taking a medicine. • If you have milder symptoms of a drug allergy, see a healthcare professional as soon as possible.",
      "Causes": "A drug allergy happens when the immune system mistakenly identifies a medicine as a harmful substance, such as a virus or bacterium. • Once the immune system detects a medicine as a harmful substance, it develops an antibody specific to that medicine. • This can happen the first time you take a medicine, but sometimes an allergy doesn't develop until there have been repeated exposures. • The next time you take the medicine, these specific antibodies flag the medicine and direct immune system attacks on the substance. • Chemicals released by this activity cause the symptoms associated with an allergic reaction. • You may not be aware of your first exposure to a medicine, however. • Some evidence suggests that trace amounts of a medicine in the food supply, such as an antibiotic, may be enough for the immune system to create an antibody to it. • Some allergic reactions may result from a somewhat different process. • Researchers believe that some medicines can bind directly to a certain type of immune system white blood cell called a T cell. • This event causes the release of chemicals that can result in an allergic reaction the first time you take the medicine. • Although any medicine can cause an allergic reaction, some medicines are more commonly associated with allergies. • These include: Antibiotics, such as penicillin. • Pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). • Chemotherapy drugs for treating cancer. • Medicines for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. • Sometimes a reaction to a medicine can produce symptoms that are virtually the same as those of a drug allergy. • However, a drug reaction isn't triggered by immune system activity. • This condition is called a nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction or pseudoallergic drug reaction. • Medicines that are more commonly associated with this condition include: Aspirin. • Dyes used in imaging tests, known as radiocontrast media. • Opiates for treating pain. • Local anesthetics.",
      "Risk factors": "While anyone can have an allergic reaction to a drug, a few factors can increase someone's risk. • These include: A history of other allergies, such as a food allergy or hay fever. • A personal or family history of drug allergy. • Increased exposure to a medicine because of high doses, repeated use or prolonged use. • Certain infections commonly associated with allergic drug reactions, such as HIV infection or Epstein-Barr virus infection.",
      "Prevention": "If you have a drug allergy, the best prevention is to avoid using the problem medicine. • Steps you can take to protect yourself include the following: Inform healthcare professionals. • Be sure that your drug allergy is clearly identified in your medical records. • Inform other healthcare professionals, such as your dentist or any medical specialist. • Wear a bracelet. • Wear a medical alert bracelet that identifies your drug allergy. • This information can ensure proper treatment in an emergency."

      "Overview": "Dry macular degeneration is an eye condition that causes blurred vision or reduced central vision. • It is caused by the breakdown of a part of the retina known as the macula (MAK-u-luh). • The macula is responsible for central vision. • This condition is common among people over 50. • Dry macular degeneration may start in one eye then develop in the other eye. • It also may develop in both eyes at the same time. • Over time, vision may worsen and affect the ability to do things, such as read, drive and recognize faces. • But having dry macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose all your sight. • Vision loss is typically central, and people retain their side vision. • Some people have only mild central vision loss. • In others, it can be more severe. • Early detection and self-care measures may delay vision loss caused by dry macular degeneration.",
      "Symptoms": "Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and without pain. • They may include: Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent. • Reduced central vision in one or both eyes. • The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work. • Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater. • Increased blurriness of printed words. • Difficulty recognizing faces. • A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision. • Dry macular degeneration can affect one or both eyes. • If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. • This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. • And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness. • Dry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. • It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. • The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. • The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss. • See your eye care professional if: You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision. • You lose the ability to see fine detail. • These changes may be the first sign of macular degeneration, particularly if you're over age 60.",
      "Causes": "No one knows exactly what causes dry macular degeneration. • Research suggests that it may be a combination of genes and other factors, including smoking, obesity and diet. • The condition develops as the eye ages. • Dry macular degeneration affects the macula. • The macula is the area of the retina that's responsible for clear vision in the direct line of sight. • Over time, tissue in the macula may thin and lose cells responsible for vision.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of macular degeneration include: Age. • This disease is most common in people over 50. • Family history and genetics. • This disease has a hereditary component, meaning it runs in families. • Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition. • Race. • Macular degeneration is more common in white people. • Smoking. • Smoking cigarettes or being exposed to tobacco smoke on a regular basis greatly increases the risk of macular degeneration. • Obesity. • Research suggests that obesity may increase the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more serious form of the disease. • Cardiovascular disease. • If you have heart or blood vessel disease, called cardiovascular disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.",
      "Complications": "People whose dry macular degeneration has progressed to central vision loss have a higher risk of depression and social isolation. • With profound loss of vision, people may see visual hallucinations. • This condition is called Charles Bonnet syndrome. • Dry macular degeneration may progress to wet macular degeneration, which can quickly cause complete vision loss if left untreated.",
      "Prevention": "It's important to have routine eye exams to identify early signs of macular degeneration. • The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing dry macular degeneration: Manage all medical conditions. • For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your healthcare team's instructions for controlling the condition. • Don't smoke. • People who smoke are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are people who don't smoke. • Ask a healthcare professional for help stopping smoking. • Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly. • If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day. • Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. • These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration. • Include fish in your diet. • Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. • Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids."

      "Overview": "Dry mouth, also called xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), is when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. • Dry mouth often is due to aging, the side effects of certain medicines or radiation therapy for cancer. • Less often, a condition directly affecting the salivary glands can cause dry mouth. • You also may experience dry mouth temporarily if you are thirsty or feel anxious about something. • For some people, dry mouth is only annoying. • For others, dry mouth can greatly affect general health and the health of teeth and gums. • Also, it can affect how much people eat and how much they enjoy what they eat. • Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these symptoms all or most of the time: Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth. • Saliva that seems thick and stringy. • Bad breath. • Having a hard time chewing, speaking and swallowing. • Dry or sore throat and hoarseness. • Dry or grooved tongue. • A changed sense of taste. • Problems wearing dentures. • Lipstick stuck to teeth. • Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away sugar and food particles and making bacteria neutral and less harmful. • When you don't have enough saliva, you may find it harder to taste, chew and swallow. • You also may have a hard time digesting food. • If you have dry mouth symptoms that don't go away, make an appointment with your healthcare professional. • Dry mouth is caused when the salivary glands in the mouth don't make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet. • Sometimes these glands may not work properly due to: Medicines. • Hundreds of medicines, including many medicines available without a prescription, can cause dry mouth. • Among the medicines more likely to cause problems are those for depression, high blood pressure and anxiety, as well as some antihistamines, decongestants, muscle relaxants and pain relievers. • Aging. • Many older people have symptoms of dry mouth as they age. • Certain changes in how the body processes medicine, poor nutrition and long-term health problems can cause dry mouth. • Cancer therapy. • Medicine to treat cancer, called chemotherapy, can change the nature of saliva and the amount produced. • This may be for a limited time, with typical salivary flow returning after treatment ends. • Radiation treatments to the head and neck can damage salivary glands, greatly lowering saliva production. • This may be for a limited time, or it could be lasting, depending on the radiation dose and area treated. • Nerve damage. • An injury or surgery that causes nerve damage to the head and neck area can be due to dry mouth. • Other health conditions. • Dry mouth can be due to certain health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, a yeast infection in the mouth or Alzheimer's disease. • Or dry mouth could be due to autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome or HIV/AIDS. • Snoring and mouth breathing. • Snoring and breathing with the mouth open can lead to dry mouth. • Tobacco and alcohol use. • Drinking alcohol and smoking or chewing tobacco can lead to more dry mouth symptoms. • Use of legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets. • Methamphetamine use can cause serious dry mouth, and it can damage teeth. • Marijuana use also can cause dry mouth. • Risk of dry mouth is higher in people who: Take medicines that have dry mouth listed as a possible side effect. • Are being treated for cancer. • Have nerve damage in the head and neck area. • Have other health conditions, such as diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Sjogren syndrome or HIV/AIDS. • Use tobacco products. • Drink alcohol. • Use street drugs. • Eat sugary or acidic foods or candies. • Not having enough saliva and getting dry mouth can lead to: Increased plaque, tooth decay and gum disease. • Mouth sores. • A yeast infection in the mouth, also known as thrush. • Sores or split skin at the corners of the mouth, or cracked lips. • Poor nutrition from having problems with chewing and swallowing.",

      "Overview": "Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly. • The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person. • It's a common condition that affects people of all ages. • Dry skin, also known as xerosis or xeroderma, has many causes, including cold or dry weather, sun damage, harsh soaps, and overbathing. • You can do a lot on your own to improve dry skin, including moisturizing and practicing sun protection year-round. • Try various products and skin care routines to find an approach that works for you.",
      "Symptoms": "Dry skin is often temporary or seasonal — you might get it only in winter, for example — or you might need to treat it long term. • Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. • They include: A feeling of skin tightness Skin that feels and looks rough Itchiness (pruritus) Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin Slight to severe scaling or peeling Cracked \"dry riverbed\" look to leg Fine lines or cracks Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin Deep cracks that may bleed Most cases of dry skin respond well to lifestyle changes and home remedies. • You may need help from your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist) if: You've tried self-care steps but your signs and symptoms persist Your skin becomes inflamed or painful You develop dry, thick skin as a side effect of cancer treatment Your condition makes you so uncomfortable that you're losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines You have open sores or infections from scratching You have large areas of scaly or peeling skin Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin. • It might be caused by: Heat. • Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity. • Environment. • Living in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates. • Too much bathing or scrubbing. • Taking long, hot showers or baths or scrubbing your skin too much can dry your skin. • Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too. • Harsh soaps and detergents. • Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin because they are formulated to remove oil. • Other skin conditions. • People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are more likely to have dry skin. • Medical treatments. • Some people develop dry, thick skin after undergoing treatment for cancer, receiving dialysis or taking certain medications. • Aging. • As people age, the skin thins and produces less of the oils needed for the skin to retain water. • Anyone can develop dry skin. • But you're more likely to develop the condition if you: Are over 40, as the skin's ability to retain moisture diminishes with age Live in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates Have a job that requires you to immerse your hands in water, such as nursing or hairstyling Use your hands to work with cement, clay or soil Swim frequently in chlorinated pools Have certain diseases or conditions, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes or malnutrition Dry skin is usually harmless. • But when it's not cared for, dry skin may lead to: Atopic dermatitis (eczema). • If you're prone to develop this condition, excessive dryness can lead to activation of the disease, causing a rash and cracking skin. • Infections. • Dry skin may crack, allowing bacteria to enter, causing infections. • These complications are most likely to occur when your skin's protective mechanisms are severely compromised. • For example, severely dry skin can cause deep cracks or fissures, which can open and bleed, providing an avenue for invading bacteria. • Try these tips to help your skin retain moisture: Moisturize. • Moisturizer seals in water to help keep your skin's protective barrier healthy. • Use moisturizer throughout the day, especially on the hands. • And before going outdoors, use a moisturizer that contains sunblock or a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Limit water exposure. • Keep bath and shower time to 10 minutes or less. • Use warm, not hot, water. • Rinse and pat dry. • Try to bathe no more than once a day. • Use a gentle cleanser or allergen-free soap. • Try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel. • Or use fragrance-free moisturizing soap with no alcohol or allergy-causing substances (hypoallergenic soap), especially if you handwash often. • Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. • Apply a moisturizing cream while your skin is still damp. • Shave with care. • Shaving can be drying. • If you shave, use a lubricating agent before you start. • Shave in the direction of hair growth, unless that irritates your skin. • Use a sharp blade and rinse it with warm water after each stroke. • When done, apply moisturizer. • Cover as much skin as possible in cold or windy weather. • Harsh weather can be especially drying to skin. • Scarves, hats, and gloves or mittens help protect your skin when you're outdoors. • Wear gloves. • Protect your hands with suitable gloves when gardening, using harsh cleansers and doing other skin-drying activities. • Rinse and moisturize after swimming. • This is especially important if you've been swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool. • Drink when you're thirsty. • Drink noncaffeinated beverages each day to help keep all your body's tissues, including your skin, well hydrated. • Bathe babies with care. • For babies, using a cleanser every 1-2 weeks for bathing usually is enough. • Otherwise, bathe them in just water. • However, clean their diaper area with each diaper change. • Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline, Aquaphor, others) while the skin is still damp.",

      "Overview": "Dry socket is a painful dental condition that sometimes happens after you have a tooth removed. • Having a tooth removed is called an extraction. • Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed. • Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. • This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. • Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site. • Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. • Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. • The socket becomes swollen and irritated. • It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. • If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal. • Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth. • Medicine you can buy without a prescription usually will not be enough to treat dry socket pain. • Your dentist or oral surgeon can offer treatments to relieve your pain.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of dry socket may include: Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth. • Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. • The socket may look empty. • Bone that you can see in the socket. • Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal. • Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth. • Bad taste in your mouth. • A certain amount of pain and discomfort is typical after a tooth removal. • But you should be able to manage the pain with the pain reliever your dentist or oral surgeon prescribed. • The pain should lessen with time. • If you develop new pain or the pain gets worse in the days after your tooth removal, contact your dentist or oral surgeon right away. • The exact cause of dry socket is still being studied. • Researchers think that certain issues may be involved, such as: Bacteria that gets into the socket. • Injury at the surgical site when tooth removal is difficult. • This can happen with irregular wisdom tooth development or position, called an impacted wisdom tooth. • Factors that can increase your risk of developing dry socket include: Smoking and tobacco use. • Chemicals in cigarettes or other forms of tobacco may prevent or slow healing. • These chemicals can get into the wound site. • Also, the act of sucking on a cigarette may cause the blood clot to come out too early. • Birth control pills. • High estrogen levels from birth control pills may cause problems with healing and increase the risk of dry socket. • Improper at-home care. • Not following home-care instructions and having poor mouth care may increase the risk of dry socket. • Tooth or gum infection. • Current or previous infections around the area where the tooth was removed increase the risk of dry socket. • Even though a dry socket can be painful, it rarely causes an infection or serious complications. • But healing in the socket may be delayed. • Pain may last longer than usual after a tooth removal. • Dry socket also may lead to an infection in the socket. • You can take these steps to help prevent dry socket: Look for a dentist or oral surgeon with experience in removing teeth. • Practice good oral care by brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day. • Good oral care before surgery keeps your teeth and gums clean and removes bacteria. • If you smoke or use other tobacco products, try to stop smoking before your tooth is removed. • Smoking and using other tobacco products increase your risk of dry socket. • Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about a program to help you quit for good. • Talk to your dentist or oral surgeon about any prescription medicines, medicines you can buy off the shelf, herbs, or other supplements you're taking. • Some may cause problems with blood clotting. • Your dentist or oral surgeon can take steps to help with proper healing of the socket and prevent dry socket. • These steps may include recommending one or more of these medicines, which may help prevent dry socket and infections: Dressing with medicine to put on the wound after surgery. • Antibacterial mouthwashes or gels immediately before and after surgery. • Antiseptic solutions to put on the wound. • Oral antibiotics, usually only if you have a weakened immune system. • Your dentist or oral surgeon can give you instructions about what to expect during the healing process after a tooth removal and how to care for the site. • Proper at-home care after a tooth removal helps with healing and prevents damage to the wound. • To help prevent dry socket, instructions will likely include: Activity. • After your surgery, plan to rest for that day. • Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about when you can return to your usual activities. • Also follow instructions about how long to avoid vigorous exercise and sports that might cause the blood clot to come out of the socket. • Pain management. • Put cold packs on the outside of your face on the first day after tooth removal. • After the first day, warm packs may help. • Cold and warm packs can help decrease pain and swelling. • Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about putting cold or heat on your face. • Take pain medicines as prescribed. • Beverages. • Drink lots of water after the surgery. • Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages for as long as recommended. • Do not drink with a straw for at least a week. • The sucking action may cause the blood clot to come out of the socket. • Food. • Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first day. • Be careful with hot and cold liquids or biting your cheek until the numbness wears off. • When you feel ready, start eating foods that do not need a lot of chewing. • Avoid chewing on the surgery side of your mouth. • Cleaning your mouth. • After surgery, you may gently rinse your mouth and brush your teeth, but avoid the site where the tooth was removed for the first 24 hours. • After the first 24 hours, gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day for a week after your surgery. • Mix 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of table salt in 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of water. • Follow the instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon. • Tobacco use. • If you smoke or use tobacco, do not do so for at least 48 hours after surgery and as long as you can after that. • Using tobacco products after oral surgery can slow healing and increase the risk of complications.",

      "Overview": "Ductal carcinoma in situ is a very early form of breast cancer. • In ductal carcinoma in situ, the cancer cells are confined inside a milk duct in the breast. • The cancer cells haven't spread into the breast tissue. • Ductal carcinoma in situ is often shortened to DCIS. • It's sometimes called noninvasive, preinvasive or stage 0 breast cancer. • DCIS is usually found during a mammogram done as part of breast cancer screening or to investigate a breast lump. • DCIS has a low risk of spreading and becoming life-threatening. • However, it does require an evaluation and a consideration of treatment options. • Treatment for DCIS often involves surgery. • Other treatments may combine surgery with radiation therapy or hormone therapy.",
      "Symptoms": "Ductal carcinoma in situ doesn't typically cause symptoms. • This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. • DCIS can sometimes cause symptoms such as: A breast lump. • Bloody nipple discharge. • DCIS is usually found on a mammogram. • It appears as tiny flecks of calcium in the breast tissue. • These are calcium deposits, often referred to as calcifications. • Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice a change in your breasts. • Changes to look for may include a lump, an area of puckered or otherwise unusual skin, a thickened region under the skin, and nipple discharge. • Ask your healthcare professional when you should consider breast cancer screening and how often it should be repeated. • Most healthcare professionals recommend considering routine breast cancer screening beginning in your 40s. • It's not clear what causes ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. • This early form of breast cancer happens when cells inside a breast duct develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • In DCIS, the cancer cells don't yet have the ability to break out of the breast duct and spread into the breast tissue. • Healthcare professionals don't know exactly what causes the changes in the cells that leads to DCIS. • Factors that may play a part include lifestyle, environment and DNA changes that run in families. • Several factors may increase the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. • DCIS is an early form of breast cancer. • Risk factors for breast cancer may include: A family history of breast cancer. • If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. • The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. • Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. • A personal history of breast cancer. • If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. • A personal history of breast conditions. • Certain breast conditions are a sign of a higher risk of breast cancer. • These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Beginning your period at a younger age. • Beginning your period before age 12 increases the risk of breast cancer. • Beginning menopause at an older age. • Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. • Being female. • Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. • Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. • Dense breast tissue. • Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. • Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. • If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. • Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. • If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. • Drinking alcohol. • Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. • Having your first child at an older age. • Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Having never been pregnant. • Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. • Never having been pregnant increases the risk. • Increasing age. • The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older. • Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. • Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. • The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. • These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer. • Menopausal hormone therapy. • Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. • The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. • The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. • Obesity. • People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Radiation exposure. • If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher. • Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of ductal carcinoma in situ. • This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. • To lower your risk of breast cancer, try to: Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. • Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. • Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. • You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. • If you find a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, tell a healthcare professional right away. • Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. • But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. • This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. • If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day. • For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. • So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. • If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether exercising is OK and start slowly. • Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. • Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. • These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. • To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. • If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. • If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. • Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. • This early form of breast cancer happens when cells inside a breast duct develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • In DCIS, the cancer cells don't yet have the ability to break out of the breast duct and spread into the breast tissue. • Healthcare professionals don't know exactly what causes the changes in the cells that leads to DCIS. • Factors that may play a part include lifestyle, environment and DNA changes that run in families.",
      "Risk factors": "Several factors may increase the risk of ductal carcinoma in situ, also called DCIS. • DCIS is an early form of breast cancer. • Risk factors for breast cancer may include: A family history of breast cancer. • If a parent, sibling or child had breast cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • The risk is higher if your family has a history of getting breast cancer at a young age. • The risk also is higher if you have multiple family members with breast cancer. • Still, most people diagnosed with breast cancer don't have a family history of the disease. • A personal history of breast cancer. • If you've had cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of getting cancer in the other breast. • A personal history of breast conditions. • Certain breast conditions are a sign of a higher risk of breast cancer. • These conditions include lobular carcinoma in situ, also called LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia of the breast. • If you've had a breast biopsy that found one of these conditions, you have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Beginning your period at a younger age. • Beginning your period before age 12 increases the risk of breast cancer. • Beginning menopause at an older age. • Beginning menopause after age 55 increases the risk of breast cancer. • Being female. • Women are much more likely than men are to get breast cancer. • Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. • Dense breast tissue. • Breast tissue is made up of fatty tissue and dense tissue. • Dense tissue is made of milk glands, milk ducts and fibrous tissue. • If you have dense breasts, you have more dense tissue than fatty tissue in your breasts. • Having dense breasts can make it harder to detect breast cancer on a mammogram. • If a mammogram showed that you have dense breasts, your risk of breast cancer is increased. • Talk with your healthcare team about other tests you might have in addition to mammograms to look for breast cancer. • Drinking alcohol. • Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. • Having your first child at an older age. • Giving birth to your first child after age 30 may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Having never been pregnant. • Having been pregnant one or more times lowers the risk of breast cancer. • Never having been pregnant increases the risk. • Increasing age. • The risk of breast cancer goes up as you get older. • Inherited DNA changes that increase cancer risk. • Certain DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. • The most well-known changes are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. • These changes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but not everyone with these DNA changes gets cancer. • Menopausal hormone therapy. • Taking certain hormone therapy medicines to control the symptoms of menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer. • The risk is linked to hormone therapy medicines that combine estrogen and progesterone. • The risk goes down when you stop taking these medicines. • Obesity. • People with obesity have an increased risk of breast cancer. • Radiation exposure. • If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is higher.",
      "Prevention": "Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of ductal carcinoma in situ. • This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS. • To lower your risk of breast cancer, try to: Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. • Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. • Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. • You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. • If you find a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, tell a healthcare professional right away. • Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. • But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. • This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. • If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day. • For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. • So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. • Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. • If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether exercising is OK and start slowly. • Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. • Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. • Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. • These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. • To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. • If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. • If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. • Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise."

      "Overview": "Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are irregular connections between arteries and veins. • They occur in the tough covering over the brain or spinal cord, known as the dura mater. • The irregular passageways between arteries and veins are called arteriovenous fistulas, which can lead to bleeding in the brain or other serious symptoms. • Dural AVFs are rare. • They tend to occur between ages 50 and 60. • They are not typically genetic, so children are not more likely to develop a dAVF if their parent has one. • Although some dAVFs stem from known causes, most often the cause is not known. • It's thought that dAVFs involving large brain veins form when one of the brain's venous sinuses narrows or becomes blocked. • Venous sinuses are channels that route circulated blood from the brain back to the heart. • Treatment for dAVF usually involves an endovascular procedure or stereotactic radiosurgery to block the blood flow to the dAVF. • Or surgery may be needed to disconnect or remove the dAVF.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) may not have symptoms. • When symptoms occur, they may be characterized as benign or aggressive. • An aggressive dAVF has more-serious symptoms. • Aggressive dAVF symptoms can result from bleeding in the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. • Bleeding in the brain often causes a sudden headache. • It also may cause other symptoms based on the location and size of the hemorrhage. • Aggressive symptoms also may result from nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits (NHNDs), which can include seizures or changes in mental abilities. • These symptoms usually develop more gradually, over days to weeks. • Symptoms are typically related to the area of the brain affected. • Aggressive symptoms can include: Sudden headache. • Trouble walking and falls. • Seizures. • Speech or language issues. • Facial pain. • Dementia. • Slowed movement, stiffness and tremor, known as parkinsonism. • Trouble with coordination. • Burning or prickling sensations. • Weakness. • Lack of interest, known as apathy. • Failure to thrive. • Symptoms related to increased pressure, such as headaches, nausea and vomiting. • Other dAVF symptoms can include hearing issues. • People with hearing symptoms may hear a rhythmic sound in the ear that occurs with the heartbeat, known as pulsatile tinnitus. • Symptoms also may include trouble with vision, such as: Vision changes. • Eye bulge. • Swelling in the eye lining. • Paralysis of a muscle in or around the eye. • Rarely, dementia may occur due to increased pressure in the blood vessels in the brain. • Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that are not usual or that worry you. • Seek medical help immediately if you experience a seizure or symptoms that suggest brain hemorrhage, such as: Sudden, severe headache. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Weakness or numbness on one side of the body. • Trouble speaking or understanding speech. • Loss of vision. • Double vision. • Trouble with balance.",
      "Causes": "Most dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) have no clear origin. • But some result from a traumatic head injury, infection, previous brain surgery, blood clots in deep veins or tumors. • Most experts think that dAVFs involving larger brain veins occur from the narrowing or blockage of one of the brain's venous sinuses. • The venous sinuses are channels in the brain that route circulated blood from the brain back to the heart.",
      "Risk factors": "Risk factors of dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) include being inclined to blood clots in the vein, known as vein thrombosis. • Changes in the way the blood clots may increase the risk of a blockage or narrowing of the venous sinuses. • Most often, dAVFs affect people between ages 50 and 60. • But they can occur in people at younger ages, including in children. • Research has found that noncancerous tumors found in the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord may be associated with dAVFs."

      "Overview": "Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. • Stature is the height of a person in a standing position. • Dwarfism generally is defined as an adult height of 4 feet, 10 inches (147 cm) or less. • The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet, 1 inch (125 cm) for women and 4 feet, 4 inches (132 cm) for men. • Many medical conditions cause dwarfism. • In general, dwarfism is divided into two broad categories: Disproportionate dwarfism. • This is when some parts of the body are small, and others are of average or above-average size. • Conditions causing this category of dwarfism get in the way of bone development. • Proportionate dwarfism. • This is when all parts of the body are small to the same degree and appear like a body of average stature. • Medical conditions present at birth or that occur in early childhood limit overall growth and development. • Some people prefer the term \"short stature\" or \"little people\" rather than \"dwarf\" or \"dwarfism.\" It's important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this condition. • Short stature conditions don't include familial short stature — short height that's thought of as a typical variation with typical bone development.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms — other than short stature — vary greatly across the range of dwarfism conditions. • Most people with dwarfism have conditions that cause short stature with body parts that aren't the same size as one another. • Usually, this means that a person has an average-sized trunk and very short limbs. • But some people may have a very short trunk and short limbs. • Those limbs are larger than the rest of the body. • In these people, the head is large compared with the body. • Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have average intelligence. • Rare exceptions are usually due to a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain. • This also is known as hydrocephalus. • The most common cause of dwarfism is a condition called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. • This condition usually results in: An average-sized trunk. • Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs. • Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers. • Limited mobility at the elbows. • A large head in relation to the rest of the body, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose. • Bowed legs that get worse. • Swayed lower back that gets worse. • An adult height of 4 feet, 1 inch (125 cm) for women and 4 feet 4 inches (132 cm) for men. • Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare condition called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). • Signs may include: A very short trunk. • A short neck. • Shortened arms and legs. • Average-sized hands and feet. • A broad, rounded chest. • Slightly flattened cheekbones. • An opening in the roof of the mouth, also called a cleft palate. • Changes in hip structure that result in thighbones turning inward. • A foot that's twisted or out of shape. • Neck bones that are not stable. • Hunching curvature of the upper spine that gets worse over time. • Swayed lower back that gets worse over time. • Vision and hearing problems. • Arthritis and problems moving joints. • Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm). • Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or that occur in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. • The head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're small to the same degree. • Because these conditions affect overall growth, poor development of one or more body systems is possible. • Growth hormone deficiency is a fairly common cause of proportionate dwarfism. • It occurs when the pituitary gland doesn't make enough growth hormone. • This hormone is needed for typical childhood growth. • Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts. • Growth rate slower than expected for age. • Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years. • Symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism often are present at birth or in early infancy. • Proportionate dwarfism may not be seen at first. • See your child's healthcare professional if you are worried about your child's growth or overall development. • Most often dwarfism is caused by gene changes, also called genetic variants. • In many children, it's due to a random change in a child's gene. • But dwarfism also can be inherited due to a genetic variant in one or both parents. • Other causes can include low levels of hormones and poor nutrition. • Sometimes the cause of dwarfism is not known. • About 80% of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height. • A person with achondroplasia who had two average-sized parents received one changed gene related to the condition and one regular gene. • A person with achondroplasia may pass along a changed gene related to the condition or a regular gene to their children. • Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only female children, results when a sex chromosome — the X chromosome — is missing or partially missing. • A female child inherits an X chromosome from each parent. • A girl with Turner syndrome has only one fully functioning copy of the female sex chromosome rather than two. • Sometimes low levels of growth hormones can be traced to a genetic change or injury. • But for most people with low hormone levels, no cause is found. • Other causes of dwarfism include other genetic conditions, low levels of other hormones, or poor nutrition. • Sometimes the cause is not known. • Risk factors depend on the type of dwarfism. • In many cases, a gene change related to dwarfism happens at random and is not passed from parent to child. • If one or both parents have dwarfism, the risk of having a child with dwarfism rises. • If you want to become pregnant and need to understand the chances of your child having dwarfism, talk with your healthcare professional about getting genetic testing. • Also ask about other risk factors. • Complications of dwarfism-related conditions can vary greatly, but some complications are common to several conditions. • The typical features of the skull, spine and limbs shared by most forms of disproportionate dwarfism result in some common complications: Delays in developing motor skills, such as sitting up, crawling and walking. • Ear infections that occur a lot and risk of hearing loss. • Bowing of the legs. • A hard time breathing while sleeping, also known as sleep apnea. • Pressure on the spinal cord at the base of the skull. • Extra fluid around the brain, also known as hydrocephalus. • Need for dental work. • Serious hunching or swaying of the back with back pain or problems breathing that get worse. • Narrowing of the channel in the lower spine that puts pressure on the spinal cord and leads to pain or numbness in the legs. • This is called spinal stenosis. • Arthritis. • Weight gain that can complicate joint and spine conditions and place pressure on nerves. • With proportionate dwarfism, problems in growth and development often lead to complications with organs that don't grow properly. • For example, heart conditions that often occur with Turner syndrome can affect health greatly. • An absence of sexual maturation related to having low growth hormone levels or Turner syndrome can affect physical development and social functioning. • Women with disproportionate dwarfism may have respiratory problems during pregnancy. • A C-section is almost always needed because the size and shape of the pelvis doesn't allow for successful vaginal delivery. • Most people with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by a condition. • But some people may refer to themselves as \"dwarfs,\" \"little people\" or \"people of short stature.\" People of average height may have misconceptions about people with dwarfism. • And the portrayal of people with dwarfism in modern movies often includes stereotypes. • Misconceptions can affect a person's self-esteem and limit how well they do at school or work. • Children with dwarfism often are teased and mocked by classmates. • Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel like they're on their own. • They may need mental health and peer support for the best quality of life.",

      "Symptoms": "Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. • Once your child reaches school age, your child's teacher may be the first to notice a problem. • Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to read. • Signs that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include: Late talking Learning new words slowly Problems forming words correctly, such as reversing sounds in words or confusing words that sound alike Problems remembering or naming letters, numbers and colors Difficulty learning nursery rhymes or playing rhyming games Once your child is in school, dyslexia symptoms may become more apparent, including: Reading well below the expected level for age Problems processing and understanding what is heard Difficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions Problems remembering the sequence of things Difficulty seeing (and occasionally hearing) similarities and differences in letters and words Inability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word Difficulty spelling Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing Avoiding activities that involve reading Dyslexia signs in teens and adults are a lot like those in children. • Some common dyslexia symptoms in teens and adults include: Difficulty reading, including reading aloud Slow and labor-intensive reading and writing Problems spelling Avoiding activities that involve reading Mispronouncing names or words, or problems retrieving words Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading or writing Difficulty summarizing a story Trouble learning a foreign language Difficulty doing math word problems Though most children are ready to learn reading by kindergarten or first grade, children with dyslexia often have trouble learning to read by that time. • Talk with your health care provider if your child's reading level is below what's expected for your child's age or if you notice other signs of dyslexia. • When dyslexia goes undiagnosed and untreated, childhood reading difficulties continue into adulthood. • Dyslexia results from individual differences in the parts of the brain that enable reading. • It tends to run in families. • Dyslexia appears to be linked to certain genes that affect how the brain processes reading and language. • A family history of dyslexia or other reading or learning disabilities increases the risk of having dyslexia. • Dyslexia can lead to several problems, including: Trouble learning. • Because reading is a skill basic to most other school subjects, a child with dyslexia is at a disadvantage in most classes and may have trouble keeping up with peers. • Social problems. • Left untreated, dyslexia may lead to low self-esteem, behavior problems, anxiety, aggression, and withdrawal from friends, parents and teachers. • Problems as adults. • The inability to read and comprehend can prevent children from reaching their potential as they grow up. • This can have negative long-term educational, social and economic impacts. • Children who have dyslexia are at increased risk of having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and vice versa. • ADHD can cause difficulty keeping attention. • It can also cause hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, which can make dyslexia harder to treat.",

      "Overview": "Dysphagia is a medical term for difficulty swallowing. • Dysphagia can be a painful condition. • In some cases, swallowing is impossible. • Occasional difficulty swallowing, such as when you eat too fast or don't chew your food well enough, usually isn't cause for concern. • But ongoing dysphagia can be a serious medical condition that needs treatment. • Dysphagia can happen at any age, but it's more common in older adults. • The causes of swallowing problems vary, and treatment depends on the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms associated with dysphagia can include: Pain while swallowing. • Not being able to swallow. • Feeling as if food is stuck in the throat or chest or behind the breastbone. • Drooling. • Hoarseness. • Food coming back up, called regurgitation. • Frequent heartburn. • Food or stomach acid backing up into the throat. • Weight loss. • Coughing or gagging when swallowing. • See a healthcare professional if you regularly have difficulty swallowing or if weight loss, regurgitation or vomiting happens with your dysphagia. • If a blockage makes it hard to breathe, call for emergency help immediately. • If you're unable to swallow because you feel that food is stuck in your throat or chest, go to the nearest emergency department. • Swallowing is complex, involving many muscles and nerves. • Any condition that weakens or damages these muscles and nerves or causes narrowing of the back of the throat or esophagus can cause dysphagia. • Dysphagia generally falls into one of the following categories. • Esophageal dysphagia refers to the sensation of food sticking or getting caught in the base of the throat or in the chest after swallowing begins. • Some causes of esophageal dysphagia include: Achalasia. • Achalasia is a condition that leads to trouble swallowing. • Damaged nerves or muscles make it hard for the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. • Achalasia tends to worsen over time. • Esophageal spasm. • This condition causes high-pressure, poorly coordinated contractions of the esophagus, usually after swallowing. • Esophageal spasm affects the involuntary muscles in the walls of the lower esophagus. • A narrowed esophagus. • Known as a stricture, a narrowed esophagus can trap large pieces of food. • Tumors or scar tissue, often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause narrowing. • Esophageal tumors. • Difficulty swallowing tends to get progressively worse when esophageal tumors are present. • Growing tumors steadily narrow the esophagus. • Foreign bodies. • Sometimes food or another object can partially block the throat or esophagus. • Older adults with dentures and people who have difficulty chewing their food may be more likely to have a piece of food become stuck in the throat or esophagus. • Esophageal ring. • A thin area of narrowing in the lower esophagus can occasionally cause difficulty swallowing solid foods. • GERD. • Stomach acid backing up into the esophagus can damage esophageal tissues. • This can lead to spasm or scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. • Eosinophilic esophagitis. • Eosinophilic esophagitis is a disease of the immune system. • It is caused when white blood cells, called eosinophils, build up in the esophagus. • Scleroderma. • Scleroderma causes the development of scar-like tissue, resulting in stiffening and hardening of tissues. • This can weaken the lower esophageal sphincter. • As a result, acid backs up into the esophagus and causes frequent heartburn. • Radiation therapy. • This cancer treatment can lead to inflammation and scarring of the esophagus. • Certain conditions can weaken the throat muscles, making it difficult to move food from the mouth into the throat and esophagus during swallowing. • A person might choke, gag or cough when trying to swallow, or have the sensation of food or fluids going down the windpipe, called the trachea, or up the nose. • This can lead to pneumonia. • Causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia include: Neurological disorders. • Certain disorders — such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's disease — can cause dysphagia. • Neurological damage. • Sudden neurological damage, such as from a stroke or a brain or spinal cord injury, can affect the ability to swallow. • Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, also known as Zenker diverticulum. • A small pouch, known as a diverticulum, that forms and collects food particles in the throat, often just above the esophagus, leads to difficulty swallowing, gurgling sounds, bad breath, and repeated throat clearing or coughing. • Cancer. • Certain cancers and some cancer treatments, such as radiation, can cause difficulty swallowing. • The following are risk factors for dysphagia: Aging. • Older adults are at higher risk of swallowing difficulties. • This is due to natural aging and wear and tear on the esophagus as well as a greater risk of certain conditions, such as stroke or Parkinson's disease. • But dysphagia isn't considered a typical sign of aging. • Certain health conditions. • People with certain neurological or nervous system disorders are more likely to have difficulty swallowing. • Difficulty swallowing can lead to: Malnutrition, weight loss and dehydration. • Dysphagia can make it difficult to take in enough food and fluids. • Aspiration pneumonia. • Food or liquid entering the airway during attempts to swallow can cause aspiration pneumonia as a result of the food introducing bacteria into the lungs. • Choking. • Food stuck in the throat can cause choking. • If food completely blocks the airway and no one intervenes with a successful Heimlich maneuver, death can occur. • Although swallowing difficulties can't be prevented, you can reduce your risk of occasional difficulty swallowing by eating slowly and chewing your food well. • However, if you have symptoms of dysphagia, see a healthcare professional. • If you have GERD, see a healthcare professional for treatment.",

      "Overview": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes the muscles to contract. • This can cause twisting motions or other movements that happen repeatedly and that aren't under the person's control. • When the condition affects one part of the body, it's called focal dystonia. • When it affects two or more areas of the body next to each other, it's called segmental dystonia. • When dystonia affects all parts of the body, it's known as general dystonia. • The muscle spasms can range from mild to more serious. • They may be painful, and they can affect the person's ability to complete daily tasks. • There's no cure for dystonia, but medicines and therapy can improve symptoms. • Surgery is sometimes used to disable or regulate nerves or certain brain regions in people with serious dystonia.",
      "Symptoms": "Dystonia affects different people in different ways. • Muscle spasms might: Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm. • Focal dystonia that begins after age 21 usually starts in the neck, arm or face. • Although it tends to remain in the single area, it may spread to a neighboring area of the body. • Occur during a specific action, such as writing by hand. • Worsen with stress, fatigue or anxiety. • Become more noticeable over time. • Areas of the body that can be affected include: Neck. • When the neck muscles are involved, it's called cervical dystonia. • Contractions cause the head to twist and turn to one side. • Or the head may pull forward or backward. • Cervical dystonia sometimes causes pain. • Eyelids. • When muscles controlling eye blinks are involved, it's called blepharospasm. • Rapid blinking or muscle spasms that cause your eyes to close make it hard to see. • The muscle spasms usually aren't painful. • They might increase in bright light or while reading, watching TV or interacting with people. • They also might increase under stress. • The eyes might feel dry, gritty or sensitive to light. • Jaw or tongue. • When the muscles of the jaw and tongue are affected, it's called oromandibular dystonia. • It can cause slurred speech, drooling, and trouble chewing or swallowing. • This type of dystonia can be painful. • It often occurs with cervical dystonia or blepharospasm. • Voice box and vocal cords. • When the voice box or vocal cords are affected, it's called laryngeal dystonia. • It can cause a strained or whispering voice. • Hand and forearm. • Some types of dystonia occur only while doing an activity over and over, such as writing or playing a musical instrument. • These are known as writer's dystonia and musician's dystonia. • Symptoms usually don't happen when the arm is at rest. • Early symptoms of dystonia often are mild, occasional and linked to a specific activity. • See a member of your healthcare team if you're having muscle contractions that you can't control.",
      "Causes": "The exact cause of dystonia isn't known. • But it might involve changes in communication between nerve cells in several regions of the brain. • Some forms of dystonia are passed down in families. • Dystonia also can be a symptom of another disease or condition, including: Parkinson's disease. • Huntington's disease. • Wilson's disease. • Traumatic brain injury. • Birth injury. • Stroke. • Brain tumor or certain conditions that develop in some people with cancer, known as paraneoplastic syndromes. • Lack of oxygen or carbon monoxide poisoning. • Infections, such as tuberculosis or encephalitis. • Reactions to certain medicines or heavy metal poisoning.",
      "Risk factors": "Your risk for dystonia increases if you have a family history of the movement disorder. • Women also have a higher risk. • They have dystonia twice as often as men do. • Another risk factor for dystonia is having a condition that causes dystonia, such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease.",
      "Complications": "Depending on the type of dystonia, complications can include: Physical disabilities that affect daily activities or specific tasks. • Trouble with vision. • Trouble moving the jaw, swallowing or speaking. • Pain and fatigue from the constant contraction of your muscles. • Depression, anxiety and social withdrawal."
