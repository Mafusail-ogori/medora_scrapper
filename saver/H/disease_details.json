      "Overview": "The H1N1 flu, sometimes called swine flu, is a type of influenza A virus. • During the 2009-10 flu season, a new H1N1 virus began causing illness in humans. • It was often called swine flu and was a new combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds and humans. • The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009. • That year the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. • In August 2010, WHO declared the pandemic over. • But the H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu. • Most people with the flu get better on their own. • But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk. • The seasonal flu vaccine can now help protect against the H1N1 flu and other seasonal flu viruses.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of flu caused by H1N1, commonly called the swine flu, are similar to those of other flu viruses. • Symptoms usually start quickly and can include: Fever, but not always. • Aching muscles. • Chills and sweats. • Cough. • Sore throat. • Runny or stuffy nose. • Watery, red eyes. • Eye pain. • Body aches. • Headache. • Tiredness and weakness. • Diarrhea. • Feeling sick to the stomach, vomiting, but this is more common in children than adults. • Flu symptoms develop about 1 to 4 days after you're exposed to the virus. • If you're generally healthy and develop flu symptoms, most people may not need to see a health care provider. • But some people are at higher risk of flu complications. • Call your care provider if you have flu symptoms and you're pregnant or have a chronic disease. • Some examples are asthma, emphysema, diabetes or a heart condition. • If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. • For adults, emergency symptoms can include: Trouble breathing or shortness of breath. • Chest pain. • Signs of dehydration such as not urinating. • Ongoing dizziness. • Seizures. • Worsening of existing medical conditions. • Severe weakness or muscle pain. • Emergency symptoms in children can include: Trouble breathing. • Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds depending on skin color. • Chest pain. • Dehydration. • Severe muscle pain. • Seizures. • Worsening of existing medical conditions. • Influenza viruses such as H1N1 infect the cells that line your nose, throat and lungs. • The virus spreads through the air in droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes or talks. • The virus enters your body when you breathe in contaminated droplets. • It also can enter your body if you touch a contaminated surface and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. • You can't catch swine flu from eating pork. • People with the virus are likely able to spread the virus from about a day before symptoms appear until about four days after they start. • Children and people with weakened immune systems may be able to spread the virus for a slightly longer time. • Factors that may increase your risk of developing H1N1 or other influenza viruses or their complications include: Age. • Influenza tends to have worse outcomes in children under age 2, and adults older than age 65. • Living or working conditions. • People who live or work in facilities with many other residents are more likely to get the flu. • Some examples are nursing homes or military barracks. • People who are staying in the hospital also are at higher risk. • Weakened immune system. • Cancer treatments, anti-rejection medications, long-term use of steroids, organ transplant, blood cancer or HIV/AIDS can weaken the immune system. • This can make it easier to catch the flu and may increase the risk of developing complications. • Chronic illnesses. • Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. • Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, and nervous system diseases. • Other examples are metabolic disorders, problems with an airway and kidney, liver or blood disease. • Race. • American Indians or Alaska Native people may have a higher risk of influenza complications. • Aspirin use under age 19. • People on long-term aspirin therapy and who are younger than 19 years of age are at risk of Reye syndrome if infected with influenza. • Pregnancy. • Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, especially in the second and third trimesters. • This risk continues up to two weeks after the baby is born. • Obesity. • People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have a higher risk of flu complications. • Influenza complications include: Worsening of chronic conditions, such as heart disease and asthma. • Pneumonia. • Neurological symptoms, ranging from confusion to seizures. • Respiratory failure. • Bronchitis. • Muscle tenderness. • Bacterial infections. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older. • The H1N1 virus is included in the seasonal flu vaccine. • The flu vaccine can lower your risk of getting the flu. • It also can lower the risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital. • Each year's seasonal flu vaccine protects against the three or four influenza viruses. • These are the viruses expected to be the most common during that year's flu season. • Flu vaccination is especially important because the flu and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cause similar symptoms. • Both COVID-19 and the flu may be spreading at the same time. • Vaccination is the best way to protect against both. • Flu vaccination could lessen symptoms that might be confused with those caused by COVID-19. • Vaccination also helps lower the number of people with severe flu and complications. • And that may lower the number of people needing to stay in the hospital. • The flu vaccine is available as an injection and as a nasal spray. • The nasal spray is approved for people between 2 and 49 years old. • It isn't recommended for some groups, such as: Children younger than age 2. • Adults age 50 and older. • Pregnant people. • Children between 2 and 17 years old who are taking aspirin or a salicylate-containing medication. • People with weakened immune systems. • Close contacts or caregivers of people with highly weakened immune systems. • Examples are people receiving chemotherapy, or recent bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. • Children 2 to 4 years old who have had asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months. • If you have an egg allergy you can still get a flu vaccine. • These measures also help prevent the flu and limit its spread: Wash your hands often. • If available, use soap and water, washing for at least 20 seconds. • Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. • Cover your coughs and sneezes. • Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. • Then wash your hands. • Avoid touching your face. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. • Clean and disinfect surfaces. • Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from a surface with the virus on it to your body. • Avoid contact with the virus. • Try to avoid people who are sick or have symptoms of flu. • And if you have symptoms, stay home if you can. • When flu is spreading, consider keeping distance between yourself and others while indoors, especially in areas with poor air flow. • If you're at high risk of complications from the flu consider avoiding swine barns at seasonal fairs and elsewhere.",

      "Overview": "Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. • It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. • Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men. • Baldness typically refers to excessive hair loss from your scalp. • Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. • Some people prefer to let their hair loss run its course untreated and unhidden. • Others may cover it up with hairstyles, makeup, hats or scarves. • And still others choose one of the treatments available to prevent further hair loss or restore growth. • Before pursuing hair loss treatment, talk with your doctor about the cause of your hair loss and treatment options.",
      "Symptoms": "Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. • It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. • Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include: Gradual thinning on top of head. • This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. • In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. • Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. • An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). • Circular or patchy bald spots. • Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. • Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. • Sudden loosening of hair. • A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. • Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. • This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. • Full-body hair loss. • Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. • The hair usually grows back. • Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. • This is a sign of ringworm. • It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. • See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. • For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness. • Also talk to your doctor if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your child's hair. • Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment. • People typically lose 50 to 100 hairs a day. • This usually isn't noticeable because new hair is growing in at the same time. • Hair loss occurs when new hair doesn't replace the hair that has fallen out. • Hair loss is typically related to one or more of the following factors: Family history (heredity). • The most common cause of hair loss is a hereditary condition that happens with aging. • This condition is called androgenic alopecia, male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness. • It usually occurs gradually and in predictable patterns — a receding hairline and bald spots in men and thinning hair along the crown of the scalp in women. • Hormonal changes and medical conditions. • A variety of conditions can cause permanent or temporary hair loss, including hormonal changes due to pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and thyroid problems. • Medical conditions include alopecia areata (al-o-PEE-she-uh ar-e-A-tuh), which is immune system related and causes patchy hair loss, scalp infections such as ringworm, and a hair-pulling disorder called trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh). • Medications and supplements. • Hair loss can be a side effect of certain drugs, such as those used for cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout and high blood pressure. • Radiation therapy to the head. • The hair may not grow back the same as it was before. • A very stressful event. • Many people experience a general thinning of hair several months after a physical or emotional shock. • This type of hair loss is temporary. • Hairstyles and treatments. • Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as pigtails or cornrows, can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. • Hot-oil hair treatments and permanents also can cause hair to fall out. • If scarring occurs, hair loss could be permanent. • A number of factors can increase your risk of hair loss, including: A family history of balding on your mother's or father's side Age Significant weight loss Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and lupus Stress Poor nutrition Most baldness is caused by genetics (male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness). • This type of hair loss is not preventable. • These tips may help you avoid preventable types of hair loss: Be gentle with your hair. • Use a detangler and avoid tugging when brushing and combing, especially when your hair is wet. • A wide-toothed comb might help prevent pulling out hair. • Avoid harsh treatments such as hot rollers, curling irons, hot-oil treatments and permanents. • Limit the tension on hair from styles that use rubber bands, barrettes and braids. • Ask your doctor about medications and supplements you take that might cause hair loss. • Protect your hair from sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light. • Stop smoking. • Some studies show an association between smoking and baldness in men. • If you're being treated with chemotherapy, ask your doctor about a cooling cap. • This cap can reduce your risk of losing hair during chemotherapy.",

      "Overview": "Hairy cell leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. • The white blood cells help fight off germs. • There are a few different types of white blood cells. • The white blood cells involved in hairy cell leukemia are called B cells. • B cells are also called B lymphocytes. • In hairy cell leukemia, the body makes too many B cells. • The cells don't look like healthy B cells. • Instead, they've undergone changes to become leukemia cells. • The leukemia cells look \"hairy\" under a microscope. • Hairy cell leukemia cells keep living when healthy cells would die as part of the natural cell life cycle. • The leukemia cells build up in the body and cause symptoms. • Hairy cell leukemia often gets worse slowly. • Treatment might not need to start right away. • When it's needed, treatment is usually with chemotherapy. • Scientists found a type of cancer that looks like hairy cell leukemia, but it gets worse much faster. • This other type of cancer is called hairy cell leukemia variant. • It's considered a separate type of cancer from hairy cell leukemia, even though it has a similar name.",
      "Symptoms": "Hairy cell leukemia might not cause symptoms. • Sometimes a health care provider finds it by accident during a blood test for another condition. • When it causes symptoms, hairy cell leukemia might cause: A feeling of fullness in your belly that may make it uncomfortable to eat more than a little at a time Fatigue Easy bruising Recurring infections Weakness Losing weight without trying Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes hairy cell leukemia. • Hairy cell leukemia begins in the white blood cells. • The white blood cells help fight germs in the body. • There are a few types of white blood cells. • The white blood cells involved in hairy cell leukemia are called B cells. • Hairy cell leukemia happens when B cells develop changes in their DNA. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • The changes tell the B cells to make a lot more B cells that don't work right. • These cells go on living when healthy cells would die as part of the natural cell life cycle. • The B cells that don't work right crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow and other organs. • This leads to the symptoms and complications of hairy cell leukemia. • For example, the extra cells can cause swelling in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes. • If there isn't enough room for healthy blood cells, this can lead to frequent infections, easy bruising and feeling very tired.",
      "Risk factors": "The risk of hairy cell leukemia may be higher in: Older adults. • Hairy cell leukemia can happen at any age. • But most people diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia are in their 50s or 60s. • It's rare in children. • Males. • Hairy cell leukemia can happen to anyone. • But it's more likely in males.",
      "Complications": "Hairy cell leukemia often gets worse very slowly. • Sometimes it stays stable for many years. • For this reason, few complications of the disease occur. • If there are too many leukemia cells in the body, they can crowd out the healthy blood cells. • That can lead to: Infections. • Your body needs healthy white blood cells to fight off germs. • If your body can't make enough healthy white blood cells, you might get more infections. • Bleeding. • Your body needs healthy platelet cells to control bleeding. • If the number of platelets in your blood is low, you might notice that you bruise more easily. • You might also have bleeding from the nose or gums. • Anemia. • Your body needs healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen through your body. • Having too few red blood cells is called anemia. • Anemia can make you feel very tired. • Some studies found that people with hairy cell leukemia have an increased risk of other types of cancer. • The other cancers include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and others. • It's not clear if the other cancers are caused by hairy cell leukemia or by cancer treatments."

      "Overview": "Hammertoe and mallet toe are foot problems that cause a bend in a toe or toes. • Wearing shoes that don't fit well can cause hammertoe and mallet toe. • Other causes are foot injury and certain illnesses, such as diabetes. • Often the cause isn't known. • A hammertoe has an unusual bend in the middle joint of a toe. • Mallet toe has a bend in the joint nearest the toenail. • Hammertoe and mallet toe usually occur in the second, third and fourth toes. • Changing footwear, wearing shoe inserts, and using other devices might relieve the pain and pressure of hammertoe and mallet toe. • Surgery can correct the condition and relieve the pressure if these treatments don't work.",
      "Symptoms": "Hammertoe and mallet toe have an unusual bend in the joints of one or more of the toes. • Other symptoms include: Pain from wearing shoes. • Difficulty moving the affected toe. • Toe stiffness. • Redness and swelling. • Growth of corns and calluses from rubbing against shoes or against the ground. • See a health care provider if you have lasting foot pain that affects your ability to walk.",
      "Causes": "Hammertoe and mallet toe have been linked to: Certain shoes. • High-heeled shoes or footwear that's too tight in the toe can crowd toes so they can't lie flat. • In time, the toe might remain curled even when not in shoes. • Trauma. • A toe that has been stubbed, jammed or broken might be more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe. • Imbalance of the toe muscles. • If the muscles aren't balanced, they can put pressure on the tendons and joints. • This imbalance can lead to hammertoe and mallet toe over time.",
      "Risk factors": "Factors that can increase the risk of hammertoe and mallet toe include: Sex. • Women are more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe than are men. • Certain diseases. • Arthritis and diabetes can increase the risk of having foot problems. • Genes also might play a role.",
      "Complications": "For a while, the toe still might be able to unbend. • But over time, the tendons and joints of a hammertoe or mallet toe might tighten. • This can cause the toe to stay bent. • Shoes can rub against the higher part of the bent toe. • The bent position also may lead to excess pressure on the bone of the toe tip instead of the fat pad on the toe. • This can cause painful corns or calluses.",
      "Prevention": "Shoes that fit well can prevent many foot, heel and ankle problems. • Here's what to look for when buying shoes: Enough toe room. • Avoid shoes with pointed toes. • Low heels. • Not wearing high heels will help prevent toe and back problems. • Shoes that adjust. • Shoes with laces or straps are roomier and easier to make feel comfortable. • These added tips can help buying the right shoes: Shop at the end of the day. • Feet swell as the day goes on. • Check size. • Shoe size — especially the width — can change with age. • Measure both feet and buy for the larger foot. • Buy shoes that fit right away. • Be sure shoes are comfortable before you buy them. • A shoe repair store might be able to stretch shoes in tight spots, but it's better to buy them to fit."

      "Symptoms": "Hangover symptoms often begin when your blood alcohol content drops and is at or near zero. • Symptoms are usually in full effect the morning after a night of heavy drinking. • Depending on what and how much alcohol you drank, you may notice: Extreme tiredness and weakness. • Thirst and dry mouth. • Headache and muscle aches. • Nausea, vomiting or belly pain. • Poor sleep or not getting enough sleep. • Low tolerance for light and sound. • Dizziness or a sense of the room spinning. • Shakiness and sweating. • Problems concentrating or thinking clearly. • Changes in mood, such as depression, anxiety and irritability. • Fast heartbeat. • Hangovers after a single night's drinking go away on their own. • Talk with your healthcare professional if you're concerned that frequent heavy drinking may lead to serious problems, such as alcohol withdrawal. • More-serious symptoms from heavy drinking may be a sign of alcohol poisoning — a life-threatening emergency. • Alcohol poisoning is a serious and sometimes deadly result of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. • Drinking too much too quickly can affect breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex. • In some cases, this can lead to coma and death. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if a person who has been drinking shows symptoms of: Confusion. • Vomiting. • Seizures. • Slow breathing — less than eight breaths a minute. • Irregular breathing — a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths. • Damp or sweaty skin. • Blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. • Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder to see. • Slow heart rate. • Low body temperature. • Difficulty remaining conscious. • Passing out and not being able to be awakened. • A person who can't be awakened is at risk of dying. • If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic symptoms — get medical help right away. • Hangovers are caused by drinking too much alcohol. • A single alcoholic drink is enough to trigger a hangover for some people, while others may drink heavily and not have a hangover. • Several issues may contribute to a hangover. • For example: Alcohol causes the body to make more urine. • You lose extra body liquid by urinating more than usual. • This can lead to dehydration. • Symptoms of dehydration include extra thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness and lightheadedness. • Alcohol triggers an inflammatory response from the immune system. • The immune system may make certain substances linked to the body's defense system. • This commonly causes physical symptoms that make you feel as if you're ill. • Your symptoms also may include problems thinking clearly and remembering, poor appetite, and loss of interest in usual activities. • Alcohol irritates the lining of the stomach. • Alcohol can irritate your stomach. • Alcohol also causes your stomach to make more acid. • This can cause belly pain, nausea or vomiting. • Alcohol can cause blood sugar levels to fall. • If your blood sugar dips too low, you may feel extra tired, weak and shaky. • You also may have mood changes and even seizures. • Alcohol prevents restful sleep. • You may feel sleepy, but alcohol keeps you from getting the kind of sleep that helps you feel rested. • Alcohol also often causes you to awaken in the middle of the night or too early in the morning. • Not getting good-quality sleep may leave you groggy and tired. • Alcoholic beverages contain ingredients called congeners. • These give many types of alcoholic beverages their taste and smell. • They also can play a role in hangovers. • Congeners are found in larger amounts in dark liquors, such as brandy and bourbon, than in clear liquors, such as vodka and gin. • Congeners are more likely to produce a hangover or make a hangover worse. • But drinking too much alcohol of any color can still make you feel bad the next morning. • Anyone who drinks alcohol can have a hangover. • But some people are more likely to have hangovers than others are. • A difference in a gene that affects the way the body breaks down alcohol may make some people flush, sweat or become ill after drinking even a small amount of alcohol. • Issues that may make a hangover more likely or worse include: Drinking on an empty stomach. • Having no food in your stomach speeds up how much and how fast alcohol enters the body. • Using other drugs, such as nicotine, along with alcohol. • Smoking along with drinking appears to raise the likelihood of a hangover. • Not sleeping well or long enough after drinking. • Some researchers believe that certain hangover symptoms are often due, at least in part, to how much sleep you get following a night of drinking. • Poor-quality sleep and not getting enough sleep usually follow drinking alcohol. • Having a family history of alcohol use disorder. • Having close relatives with a history of alcohol use disorder may suggest an inherited problem with the way your body processes alcohol. • Drinking darker colored alcoholic beverages. • Darker colored drinks often contain a high level of congeners and may be more likely to produce a hangover. • Some people have a headache a few hours after drinking wine — especially red wine. • The cause of the headache isn't clear. • But it's different from a hangover, which may or may not include a headache. • It's possible that some chemicals in wine and how the body responds to them could result in a headache after drinking wine. • More research is needed to find the exact cause of wine headache. • When you have a hangover, you're likely to have problems with: Clear thinking and memory. • Attention and focus. • Tasks that require steady hands and body coordination. • Not surprisingly, this short-term dulling of your abilities increases your risk of problems at home, school and work, such as: Problems being on time or not showing up at all. • Trouble finishing tasks. • Conflict with others. • Falling asleep at school or on the job. • Problems driving a car or using machinery. • Workplace injuries. • Some companies use misleading advertising to claim that their products can prevent hangovers. • But the only guaranteed way to prevent a hangover is to not drink alcohol. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • Moderate alcohol use for healthy adults means: Up to one drink a day for women. • Up to two drinks a day for men. • The less alcohol you drink, the less likely you are to have a hangover. • It may help to: Eat before and while drinking. • Alcohol enters the body more quickly if your stomach is empty. • It may help to eat something before drinking alcohol and during the time you're drinking. • Choose carefully. • Beverages with fewer congeners are slightly less likely to cause hangovers than beverages with more congeners. • But remember that all types of alcohol can cause a hangover. • Drink water between alcoholic drinks. • Drinking a full glass of water after each alcoholic drink will help you stay hydrated. • It'll also help you drink less alcohol. • Know your limits and only drink in moderation. • Decide ahead of time how many drinks you'll have — and stick to it. • Don't feel pressured to drink. • Take it slow. • Don't have more than one alcoholic drink in an hour. • Stop drinking completely when you've reached your limit — or before then. • Some people take pain relievers to prevent hangover symptoms. • But ask your healthcare professional if this is safe for you and how much medicine is best for you. • These medicines may not work well together with other medicines you take. • Aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) can cause your stomach to make more acid, which can irritate your stomach. • And acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may cause serious liver damage if taken with too much alcohol.",

      "Overview": "Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. • These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. • But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. • Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen). • Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. • Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens. • Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. • But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. • You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Hay fever symptoms can include: Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion. • Watery, itchy, red eyes. • Sneezing. • Cough. • Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat. • Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip. • Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners. • Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep. • Your hay fever symptoms may occur year-round or may start or worsen at a particular time of year. • These are known as seasonal allergies. • Hay fever triggers include: Tree pollen, which is common in early spring. • Grass pollen, which is common in late spring and summer. • Ragweed pollen, which is common in fall. • Dust mites and cockroach droppings, which are present year-round. • Dander from pets, which can be bothersome year-round but might cause worse symptoms in winter, when houses are closed up. • Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds, which can be both seasonal and year-round. • Symptoms can be similar, so it can be difficult to tell which one you have. • See a healthcare professional if: You can't find relief from your hay fever symptoms. • Allergy medicines don't provide relief, or they cause side effects. • You have another condition that can worsen hay fever symptoms, such as nasal polyps, asthma or frequent sinus infections. • Many people — especially children — get used to hay fever symptoms, so they might not seek treatment until the symptoms become severe. • But getting the right treatment might offer relief. • When someone has hay fever, the immune system identifies a harmless airborne substance as being harmful. • This substance is called an allergen. • The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. • When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. • This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever. • The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever: Having other allergies or asthma. • Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy. • Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma. • Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites. • Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose. • Having a mother who smoked during the first year of life. • Problems that may go along with hay fever include: Reduced quality of life. • Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. • For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school. • Poor sleep. • Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. • This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise. • Worsening asthma. • Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing. • Sinusitis. • Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses. • Ear infection. • In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media. • There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. • If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. • Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.",

      "Overview": "Head and neck cancers are cancers that start in the head and neck area. • There are many kinds of cancer that can happen in the head and neck. • Each kind begins as a growth of cells that can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • Head and neck cancer often refers to cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. • But other cancers can happen in the head and neck and are sometimes considered part of this category too. • Head and neck cancer isn't a diagnosis. • Instead, it's a category of cancers that have some things in common. • For example, many head and neck cancers share some risk factors and treatments. • Most head and neck cancers begin in squamous cells. • These thin, flat cells make up the outer layer of the skin. • They also line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat. • Cancers that begin in the squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. • Cancers can begin in other kinds of cells in the head and neck area, though these are less common. • Which treatment you'll have for your head and neck cancer depends on many factors. • These might include the location of the cancer, its size and the type of cells involved. • Your healthcare team also considers your overall health. • Treatment options might include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and others.",
      "Symptoms": "Head and neck cancer symptoms may include a sore in the mouth and pain when swallowing. • Symptoms might depend on where the cancer starts. • Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. • Symptoms in the mouth and throat: A lump in the neck that you might be able to feel through the skin. • Typically the lump isn't painful. • A sore in the mouth that won't heal. • Coughing up blood. • Hoarse voice. • Loose teeth. • Pain when swallowing. • Symptoms in the nose: Nosebleeds. • Stuffy or blocked nose that doesn't go away. • Other symptoms: A sore on the skin of the face, neck or lips that doesn't heal. • Ear pain. • Losing weight without trying. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.",
      "Causes": "Experts aren't certain exactly what causes head and neck cancers. • What causes a cancer may depend on where the cancer starts. • Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. • In general, head and neck cancer starts when a cell in the head and neck area develops changes in its DNA. • A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. • In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. • The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. • In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions. • The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. • Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. • This causes too many cells. • The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. • The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. • In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. • When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.",
      "Risk factors": "Head and neck cancers have some risk factors in common. • These include using tobacco and drinking alcohol. • Other risk factors depend on the location of the cancer. • Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. • In general, things that increase the risk of head and neck cancers include: Using tobacco. • Using tobacco of any kind increases the risk of many types of head and neck cancer. • Examples of kinds of tobacco include cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff. • Drinking alcohol. • Frequent and heavy drinking increases the risk of many types of head and neck cancer. • Being exposed to human papillomavirus, also called HPV. • HPV is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. • For most people, it causes no problems and goes away on its own. • For others, it can cause changes in cells that can lead to many types of cancer. • Many throat cancers are thought to be caused by HPV. • Breathing chemicals in the air. • Exposure to chemicals in the air can increase the risk of cancer in the nose and sinuses. • Chemicals at home and at work can increase the risk. • Being exposed to the sun or tanning lamps. • Ultraviolet light from the sun increases the risk of skin cancer of the head and neck. • Ultraviolet light also can come from the lights used in tanning beds.",
      "Prevention": "To help prevent head and neck cancers, don't smoke and limit the amount of alcohol you drink. • Other steps you can take may depend on the specific type of cancer. • Head and neck cancers include cancers that start in the mouth, throat, sinuses and salivary glands. • To lower the risk of head and neck cancer: If you don't smoke or use other kinds of tobacco, don't start. • If you do use tobacco, make a plan to quit. • Talk with a healthcare professional about things that can help you quit. • If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. • For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Receiving a vaccination to prevent HPV infection may reduce the risk of HPV-related cancers. • Ask a healthcare professional whether the HPV vaccine is right for you. • Wear a hat with a wide brim to shade your head and neck. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. • Apply sunscreen generously. • Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating."

      "Overview": "Hearing loss that comes on little by little as you age, also known as presbycusis, is common. • More than half the people in the United States older than age 75 have some age-related hearing loss. • There are three types of hearing loss: Conductive, which involves the outer or middle ear. • Sensorineural, which involves the inner ear. • Mixed, which is a mix of the two. • Aging and being around loud noises both can cause hearing loss. • Other factors, such as too much earwax, can lower how well ears work for a time. • You usually can't get hearing back. • But there are ways to improve what you hear.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of hearing loss may include: Muffling of speech and other sounds. • Trouble understanding words, especially when in a crowd or a noisy place. • Trouble hearing the letters of the alphabet that aren't vowels. • Often asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly. • Needing to turn up the volume of the television or radio. • Staying clear of some social settings. • Being bothered by background noise. • Ringing in the ears, known as tinnitus. • If you have a sudden loss of hearing, particularly in one ear, seek medical attention right away. • Talk to your health care provider if loss of hearing is causing you trouble. • Age-related hearing loss happens little by little. • So you may not notice it at first. • To understand how hearing loss happens, it can be helpful to understand how hearing works. • The ear has three main parts: the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. • Sound waves pass through the outer ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate. • The eardrum and three small bones of the middle ear make the vibrations bigger as they travel to the inner ear. • There, the vibrations pass through fluid in a snail-shaped part of the inner ear, known as the cochlea. • Attached to nerve cells in the cochlea are thousands of tiny hairs that help turn sound vibrations into electrical signals. • The electrical signals are transmitted to the brain. • The brain turns these signals into sound. • Causes of hearing loss include: Damage to the inner ear. • Aging and loud noise can cause wear and tear on the hairs or nerve cells in the cochlea that send sound signals to the brain. • Damaged or missing hairs or nerve cells don't send electrical signals well. • This causes hearing loss. • Higher pitched tones may seem muffled. • It may be hard to pick out words against background noise. • Buildup of earwax. • Over time, earwax can block the ear canal and keep sound waves from passing through. • Earwax removal can help restore hearing. • Ear infection or unusual bone growths or tumors. • In the outer or middle ear, any of these can cause hearing loss. • Ruptured eardrum, also known as tympanic membrane perforation. • Loud blasts of noise, sudden changes in pressure, poking an eardrum with an object and infection can cause the eardrum to burst. • Factors that damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in the inner ear include: Aging. • The inner ear breaks down over time. • Loud noise. • Being around loud sounds can damage the cells of the inner ear. • Damage can happen by being around loud noises over time. • Or the damage can come from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot. • Heredity. • Your genes may make you more likely to have ear damage from sound or from aging. • Noises on the job. • Jobs where loud noise is constant, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside the ear. • Noises at play. • Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss. • Other activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music. • Some medicines. • These include the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil (Viagra) and certain medicines used to treat cancer, which can damage the inner ear. • Very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics can cause short-term effects on hearing. • These include ringing in the ears, also known as tinnitus, or hearing loss. • Some illnesses. • Illnesses such as meningitis that cause high fever can harm the cochlea. • The chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels. • A decibel is a unit used to measure how loud sound is. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says noise above 70 decibels over time can start to damage hearing. • The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause lasting hearing damage. • Below are the loudest noise levels people can be around on a job without hearing protection and for how long. • Hearing loss can make life less pleasant. • Older adults with hearing loss often report being depressed. • Because hearing loss can make it harder to talk with others, some people with hearing loss feel cut off from others. • Hearing loss is also linked to loss of thinking skills, known as cognitive impairment. • Hearing loss also is linked to risk of falling. • The following steps can help prevent hearing loss from loud noises and keep hearing loss from aging from getting worse: Protect your ears. • Staying away from loud noise is the best protection. • In the workplace, plastic earplugs or glycerin-filled earmuffs can help protect hearing. • Have your hearing tested. • If you work around a lot of noise, think about regular hearing tests. • If you've lost some hearing, you can take steps to prevent further loss. • Avoid risks from hobbies and play. • Riding a snowmobile or a jet ski, hunting, using power tools, or listening to rock concerts can damage hearing over time. • Wearing hearing protectors or taking breaks from the noise can protect your ears. • Turning down the volume when listening to music helps too.",

      "Risk factors": "Factors that damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in the inner ear include: Aging. • The inner ear breaks down over time. • Loud noise. • Being around loud sounds can damage the cells of the inner ear. • Damage can happen by being around loud noises over time. • Or the damage can come from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot. • Heredity. • Your genes may make you more likely to have ear damage from sound or from aging. • Noises on the job. • Jobs where loud noise is constant, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside the ear. • Noises at play. • Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss. • Other activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music. • Some medicines. • These include the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil (Viagra) and certain medicines used to treat cancer, which can damage the inner ear. • Very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics can cause short-term effects on hearing. • These include ringing in the ears, also known as tinnitus, or hearing loss. • Some illnesses. • Illnesses such as meningitis that cause high fever can harm the cochlea. • The chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels. • A decibel is a unit used to measure how loud sound is. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says noise above 70 decibels over time can start to damage hearing. • The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause lasting hearing damage. • Below are the loudest noise levels people can be around on a job without hearing protection and for how long.",
      "Complications": "Hearing loss can make life less pleasant. • Older adults with hearing loss often report being depressed. • Because hearing loss can make it harder to talk with others, some people with hearing loss feel cut off from others. • Hearing loss is also linked to loss of thinking skills, known as cognitive impairment. • Hearing loss also is linked to risk of falling.",
      "Prevention": "The following steps can help prevent hearing loss from loud noises and keep hearing loss from aging from getting worse: Protect your ears. • Staying away from loud noise is the best protection. • In the workplace, plastic earplugs or glycerin-filled earmuffs can help protect hearing. • Have your hearing tested. • If you work around a lot of noise, think about regular hearing tests. • If you've lost some hearing, you can take steps to prevent further loss. • Avoid risks from hobbies and play. • Riding a snowmobile or a jet ski, hunting, using power tools, or listening to rock concerts can damage hearing over time. • Wearing hearing protectors or taking breaks from the noise can protect your ears. • Turning down the volume when listening to music helps too."

      "Overview": "A heart arrhythmia (uh-RITH-me-uh) is an irregular heartbeat. • A heart arrhythmia occurs when the electrical signals that tell the heart to beat don't work properly. • The heart may beat too fast or too slow. • Or the pattern of the heartbeat may be inconsistent. • A heart arrhythmia may feel like a fluttering, pounding or racing heartbeat. • Some heart arrhythmias are harmless. • Others may cause life-threatening symptoms. • There are times when it is OK to have a fast or slow heartbeat. • For example, the heart may beat faster with exercise or slow down during sleep. • Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medicines, devices such as pacemakers, or a procedure or surgery. • The goals of treatment are to control or get rid of fast, slow or otherwise irregular heartbeats. • A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. • In general, heart arrhythmias are grouped by the speed of the heart rate. • For example: Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh) is a fast heartbeat. • The heart rate is greater than 100 beats a minute. • Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heartbeat. • The heart rate is less than 60 beats a minute. • Types of tachycardias include: Atrial fibrillation (AFib). • Chaotic heart signaling causes a rapid, uncoordinated heartbeat. • AFib may be temporary and start and stop on its own. • But some episodes may not stop unless treated. • AFib has been linked to stroke. • Atrial flutter. • Atrial flutter is similar to AFib, but the heartbeats are more organized. • Atrial flutter also is linked to stroke. • Supraventricular tachycardia. • This broad term includes irregular heartbeats that start above the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a pounding heartbeat that start and stop suddenly. • Ventricular fibrillation. • Rapid, chaotic electrical signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver instead of squeezing in a coordinated way. • This serious problem can lead to death if a regular heart rhythm isn't restored within minutes. • Most people with ventricular fibrillation have an underlying heart disease or had a serious injury. • Ventricular tachycardia. • This rapid, irregular heart rate starts with faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. • The rapid heart rate doesn't let the ventricles properly fill with blood. • So the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. • Ventricular tachycardia may not cause serious problems in people with otherwise healthy hearts. • In those with heart disease, ventricular tachycardia can be an emergency that needs immediate medical care. • A heart rate below 60 beats a minute is considered bradycardia. • But a low resting heart rate doesn't always mean there's a problem. • If you're physically fit, your heart may be able to pump enough blood to the body with less than 60 beats a minute. • If you have a slow heart rate and your heart isn't pumping enough blood, you may have a type of bradycardia. • Types of bradycardias include: Sick sinus syndrome. • The sinus node sets the pace of the heart. • If the node doesn't work properly, the heart rate may switch between too slow and too fast. • Sick sinus syndrome can be caused by scarring near the sinus node that slows, disrupts or blocks heartbeat signals. • The condition is most common among older adults. • Conduction block. • A block of the heart's electrical pathways can cause the signals that trigger the heartbeats to slow down or stop. • Some blocks may cause no symptoms. • Others may cause skipped beats or slowed heartbeats. • Premature heartbeats are extra beats that occur one at a time, sometimes in patterns that alternate with a regular heartbeat. • If the extra beats come from the top chamber of the heart, they are called premature atrial contractions (PACs). • If they come from the bottom chamber, they are called premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). • A premature heartbeat may feel like your heart skipped a beat. • These extra beats are generally not a concern. • They rarely mean you have a more serious condition. • Still, a premature beat can trigger a longer lasting arrhythmia, especially in people with heart disease. • Occasionally, having very frequent premature ventricular beats may lead to a weak heart. • Premature heartbeats may occur when resting. • Stress, heavy exercise and the use of stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, also may cause premature heartbeats.",
      "Symptoms": "A heart arrhythmia may not cause any symptoms. • The irregular heartbeat may be noticed during a health checkup for another reason. • Symptoms of an arrhythmia may include: A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest. • A fast heartbeat. • A slow heartbeat. • Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Other symptoms may include: Anxiety. • Feeling very tired. • Lightheadedness or dizziness. • Sweating. • Fainting or almost fainting. • If you feel like your heart is beating too fast or too slow, or it's skipping a beat, make an appointment for a health checkup. • You may be told to see a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. • Get emergency medical care if you have these heart symptoms: Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Fainting. • Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack. • A type of arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. • This can cause the person to fall to the ground within seconds, also called collapse. • Soon the person's breathing and pulse will stop. • Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that needs immediate medical help. • It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. • If this happens, follow these steps: Call 911 or your local emergency number. • If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR. • Push hard and fast on the center of the chest. • Do 100 to 120 compressions a minute until medical help arrives. • You do not need to breathe into the person's mouth. • CPR helps keep blood flowing to the organs until an electrical shock can be given with an automated external defibrillator (AED). • An AED is a device that delivers a shock to restart the heart. • If an AED is available nearby, have someone get the device and follow the instructions. • No training is required to use it. • The device tells you what to do. • It's programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate. • To understand the cause of heart arrhythmias, it may help to know how the heart works. • The typical heart has four chambers. • The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • The heart's electrical system controls the heartbeat. • The heart's electrical signals start in a group of cells at the top of the heart called the sinus node. • They pass through a pathway between the upper and lower heart chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. • The movement of the signals causes the heart to squeeze and pump blood. • In a healthy heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute. • But some things can change how electrical signals travel through the heart and cause arrhythmias. • They include: A heart attack or scarring from a previous heart attack. • Blocked arteries in the heart, called coronary artery disease. • Changes to the heart's structure, such as from cardiomyopathy. • Diabetes. • High blood pressure. • Infection with COVID-19. • Overactive or underactive thyroid gland. • Sleep apnea. • Some medicines, including those used to treat colds and allergies. • Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine. • Illegal drug use or drug misuse. • Genetics. • Smoking. • Stress or anxiety. • Things that may increase the risk of heart arrhythmias include: Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery. • Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, heart valve disease, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage are risk factors for almost any kind of arrhythmia. • High blood pressure. • This condition increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease. • It also may cause the walls of the left lower heart chamber to become stiff and thick, which can change how electrical signals travel through the heart. • Heart problems present at birth. • Also called congenital heart defects, some of these problems may affect the heart rate and rhythm. • Thyroid disease. • Having an overactive or underactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats. • Obstructive sleep apnea. • This condition causes pauses in breathing during sleep. • It can lead to a slow heartbeat and irregular heartbeats, including atrial fibrillation. • Electrolyte imbalance. • Substances in the blood called electrolytes help trigger and send electrical signals in the heart. • Potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are examples of electrolytes. • If the body's electrolytes are too low or too high, it may interfere with heart signaling and lead to irregular heartbeats. • Some medicines and supplements. • Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold treatments can cause arrhythmias. • Excessive alcohol use. • Drinking too much alcohol can affect electrical signaling in the heart. • This can increase the chance of developing atrial fibrillation. • Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. • Stimulants can cause the heart to beat faster and may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. • Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may greatly affect the heart. • Some may cause sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. • Complications depend on the type of heart arrhythmia. • Possible complications of heart arrhythmias include: Blood clots, which can lead to stroke. • Heart failure. • Sudden cardiac death. • Blood-thinning medicines can lower the risk of stroke related to atrial fibrillation and other heart arrhythmias. • If you have a heart arrhythmia, ask a healthcare professional if you need to take a blood thinner. • If an arrhythmia is causing heart failure symptoms, treatment to control the heart rate may help the heart work better. • Lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may help prevent heart arrhythmias. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Don't smoke. • Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress. • Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Get good sleep. • Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily. • Limit or avoid caffeine and alcohol.",

      "Overview": "Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. • Heart disease includes: Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease. • Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias. • Heart conditions that you're born with, called congenital heart defects. • Disease of the heart muscle. • Heart valve disease. • Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.",
      "Symptoms": "Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease. • Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. • A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls usually causes coronary artery disease. • This buildup is called plaque. • The buildup of plaque in the arteries is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). • Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. • It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or a stroke. • Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort, called angina. • Shortness of breath. • Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly or back. • Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed. • You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, a stroke or heart failure. • It's important to watch for heart symptoms. • Talk with your healthcare team about any concerns. • Heart disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups. • The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. • Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include: Chest pain or discomfort. • Dizziness. • Fainting or almost fainting. • Fluttering in the chest. • Lightheadedness. • Racing heartbeat. • Shortness of breath. • Slow heartbeat. • A congenital heart defect is a heart condition present at birth. • Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. • Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include: Blue or gray skin. • Depending on skin color, these changes may be easier or harder to see. • Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes. • In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain. • Some congenital heart defects may not be found until later in childhood or during adulthood. • Symptoms may include: Getting very short of breath during exercise or activity. • Easily tiring during exercise or activity. • Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet. • In the beginning, cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. • As the condition gets worse, symptoms may include: Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. • Fatigue. • Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest. • Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep, or waking up short of breath. • Rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeats. • Swollen legs, ankles or feet. • The heart has four valves. • The valves open and close to move blood through the heart. • Many things can damage the heart valves. • If a heart valve is narrowed, it's called stenosis. • If a heart valve lets blood flow backward, it's called regurgitation. • Symptoms of heart valve disease depend on which valve isn't working right. • Symptoms may include: Chest pain. • Fainting or almost fainting. • Fatigue. • Irregular heartbeats. • Shortness of breath. • Swollen feet or ankles. • Get emergency medical help if you have these heart disease symptoms: Chest pain. • Shortness of breath. • Fainting. • Always call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack. • If you think you may have symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment for a health checkup. • Heart disease is easier to treat when found early. • Heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease. • There are many different types of heart disease. • To understand the causes of heart disease, it may help to understand how the heart works. • The heart has four chambers. • The two upper chambers are called the atria. • The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. • The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels called the pulmonary arteries. • In the lungs, blood gets oxygen. • The oxygen-rich blood goes to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins. • The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the body's main artery, called the aorta. • The blood then goes to the rest of the body. • Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. • These valves are: Aortic valve. • Mitral valve. • Pulmonary valve. • Tricuspid valve. • Each valve has flaps, called leaflets or cusps. • The flaps open and close once during each heartbeat. • If a valve flap doesn't open or close properly, less blood moves out of the heart to the rest of the body. • The heart's electrical system keeps the heart beating. • The heart's electrical signals start in a group of cells at the top of the heart called the sinus node. • They pass through a pathway between the upper and lower heart chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. • The movement of the signals causes the heart to squeeze and pump blood. • A buildup of fatty substances in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. • Risk factors include an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking. • Healthy-lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis. • Common causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include: Heart muscle disease, called cardiomyopathy. • Coronary artery disease. • Diabetes. • Illegal drugs such as cocaine. • Emotional stress. • Too much alcohol or caffeine. • Heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects. • High blood pressure. • Smoking. • Heart valve disease. • Some medicines, herbs and supplements. • A congenital heart defect happens while a baby is growing in the womb. • Healthcare professionals aren't sure exactly what causes most congenital heart defects. • But gene changes, some medical conditions, some medicines, and environmental or lifestyle factors may play a role. • The cause of cardiomyopathy depends on the type. • There are three types: Dilated cardiomyopathy. • This is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. • The cause is often unknown. • It may be passed down through families, which means it's inherited. • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • This type is usually passed down through families. • Restrictive cardiomyopathy. • This type of cardiomyopathy can happen for no known reason. • Sometimes a buildup of protein called amyloid causes it. • Other causes include connective tissue disorders. • Many things can cause a damaged or diseased heart valve. • Some people are born with heart valve disease. • If this happens, it's called congenital heart valve disease. • Other causes of heart valve disease can include: Rheumatic fever. • Infection in the lining of the heart valves, called infectious endocarditis. • Connective tissue disorders. • Risk factors for heart disease include: Age. • Growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle. • Sex assigned at birth. • Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. • The risk in women increases after menopause. • Family history. • A family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age. • That means before age 55 for a male relative, such as a brother or your father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or a sister. • Smoking. • If you smoke, quit. • Substances in tobacco smoke damage the arteries. • Heart attacks are more common in people who smoke than in people who don't smoke. • Talk with a healthcare professional if you need help quitting. • Unhealthy diet. • Diets high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease. • High blood pressure. • High blood pressure that's not controlled can cause the arteries to become hard and thick. • These changes alter blood flow to the heart and body. • High cholesterol. • Having high cholesterol increases the risk of atherosclerosis. • Atherosclerosis has been linked to heart attack and stroke. • Diabetes. • Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease. • Obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. • Obesity. • Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors. • Lack of exercise. • Being inactive is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its risk factors too. • Stress. • Emotional stress may damage the arteries and make other heart disease risk factors worse. • Poor dental health. • Having unhealthy teeth and gums makes it easier for germs to get into the bloodstream and travel to the heart. • This can cause an infection called endocarditis. • Brush and floss your teeth often. • Also get regular dental checkups. • Possible complications of heart disease are: Heart failure. • This is one of the most common complications of heart disease. • The heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Heart attack. • A heart attack can happen if a piece of plaque in an artery or a blood clot moves to the heart. • Stroke. • The risk factors that lead to heart disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke. • This type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked. • Too little blood reaches the brain. • Aneurysm. • An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. • If an aneurysm bursts, you may have life-threatening internal bleeding. • Peripheral artery disease. • In this condition, the arms or legs — usually the legs — don't get enough blood. • This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking, called claudication. • Atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral artery disease. • Sudden cardiac arrest. • Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart activity, breathing and consciousness. • It's usually due to a problem with the heart's electrical system. • Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. • If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death. • The same lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease also may help prevent it. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Don't smoke. • Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress. • Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Get good sleep. • Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.",

      "Complications": "Possible complications of heart disease are: Heart failure. • This is one of the most common complications of heart disease. • The heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Heart attack. • A heart attack can happen if a piece of plaque in an artery or a blood clot moves to the heart. • Stroke. • The risk factors that lead to heart disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke. • This type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked. • Too little blood reaches the brain. • Aneurysm. • An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. • If an aneurysm bursts, you may have life-threatening internal bleeding. • Peripheral artery disease. • In this condition, the arms or legs — usually the legs — don't get enough blood. • This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking, called claudication. • Atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral artery disease. • Sudden cardiac arrest. • Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart activity, breathing and consciousness. • It's usually due to a problem with the heart's electrical system. • Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. • If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death.",
      "Prevention": "The same lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease also may help prevent it. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Don't smoke. • Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress. • Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. • Get good sleep. • Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily."

      "Overview": "Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. • When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath. • Some heart conditions slowly leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. • These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure. • Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. • Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. • Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress. • But heart failure can be life-threatening. • People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. • Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood. • Heart failure also may be called congestive heart failure.",
      "Symptoms": "If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs. • Symptoms may develop slowly. • Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. • Heart failure symptoms may include: Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down. • Fatigue and weakness. • Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. • Rapid or irregular heartbeat. • Reduced ability to exercise. • Wheezing. • A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood. • Swelling of the belly area. • Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup. • Nausea and lack of appetite. • Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness. • Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack. • See your healthcare professional if you think you might have symptoms of heart failure. • Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following: Chest pain. • Fainting or severe weakness. • Rapid or irregular heartbeat with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting. • Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus. • These symptoms may be due to heart failure. • But there are many other possible causes. • Don't try to diagnose yourself. • At the emergency room, healthcare professionals do tests to learn if your symptoms are due to heart failure or something else. • Call your healthcare professional right away if you have heart failure and: Your symptoms suddenly get worse. • You develop a new symptom. • You gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days. • Such changes could mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or that treatment isn't working. • Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart. • If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. • The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood. • If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats. • The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, recreational drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. • Your genes also can play a role. • Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure. • Coronary artery disease and heart attack. • Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure. • The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. • The deposits narrow the arteries. • This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack. • A heart attack occurs suddenly when an artery feeding the heart becomes completely blocked. • Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean that the heart can no longer pump as well as it should. • High blood pressure. • Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. • Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood. • Heart valve disease. • The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. • If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. • This can weaken the heart over time. • Treating some types of heart valve disease may reverse heart failure. • Inflammation of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis. • Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure. • A heart condition that you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect. • If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. • This may lead to heart failure. • Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. • Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. • A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. • Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people. • Other diseases. • Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. • Examples are diabetes, HIV infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein. • Causes of sudden heart failure also include: Allergic reactions. • Any illness that affects the whole body. • Blood clots in the lungs. • Severe infections. • Use of certain medicines. • Viruses that attack the heart muscle. • Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. • This is the heart's main pumping chamber. • But heart failure also can affect the right side. • The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle. • Sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart. • Diseases and conditions that increase the risk of heart failure include: Coronary artery disease. • Narrowed arteries may limit the heart's supply of oxygen-rich blood, resulting in weakened heart muscle. • Heart attack. • A heart attack is a form of coronary artery disease that occurs suddenly. • Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean the heart can no longer pump as well as it should. • Heart valve disease. • Having a heart valve that doesn't work properly raises the risk of heart failure. • High blood pressure. • The heart works harder than it has to when blood pressure is high. • Irregular heartbeats. • Irregular heartbeats, especially if they are very frequent and fast, can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure. • Congenital heart disease. • Some people who develop heart failure were born with changes in the structure or function of their heart. • Diabetes. • Having diabetes increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. • Sleep apnea. • This inability to breathe properly during sleep results in low blood-oxygen levels and an increased risk of irregular heartbeats. • These things can lead to a weakened heart. • Obesity. • People who have obesity have a higher risk of developing heart failure. • Viral infections. • Some viral infections can damage to the heart muscle. • Medicines that may increase the risk of heart failure include: Some diabetes medicines. • The diabetes medicines rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) have been found to increase the risk of heart failure in some people. • Don't stop taking these medicines without first talking to your healthcare professional. • Some other medicines. • Other medicines that may lead to heart failure or heart conditions include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some medicines used to treat high blood pressure, cancer, blood conditions, irregular heartbeats, nervous system diseases, mental health conditions, lung and urinary conditions, and infections. • Other risk factors for heart failure include: Aging. • The heart's ability to work decreases with age, even in healthy people. • Alcohol use. • Drinking too much alcohol may weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. • Smoking or using tobacco. • If you smoke, quit. • Using tobacco increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure. • If you have heart failure, it's important to have regular health checkups, even if symptoms improve. • Your healthcare professional can examine you and run tests to check for complications. • Complications of heart failure depend on your age, overall health and the severity of heart disease. • They may include: Kidney damage or failure. • Heart failure can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys. • Untreated, this can cause kidney failure. • Kidney damage from heart failure can require dialysis for treatment. • Other heart changes. • Heart failure can cause changes in the heart's size and function. • These changes may damage heart valves and cause irregular heartbeats. • Liver damage. • Heart failure can cause fluid buildup that puts too much pressure on the liver. • This fluid backup can lead to scarring, which makes it more difficult for the liver to work properly. • Sudden cardiac death. • If the heart is weak, there is a risk of dying suddenly due to a dangerous irregular heart rhythm. • One way to prevent heart failure is to treat and control the conditions that can cause it. • These conditions include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. • Some of the same lifestyle changes used to manage heart failure also may help prevent it. • Try these heart-healthy tips: Don't smoke. • Get plenty of exercise. • Eat healthy foods. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Reduce and manage stress. • Take medicines as directed.",

      "Overview": "Heat exhaustion is a condition that happens when your body overheats. • Symptoms may include heavy sweating and a rapid pulse. • Heat exhaustion is one of three heat-related illnesses, with heat cramps being the mildest and heatstroke being the most serious. • Causes of heat illness include exposure to high temperatures, particularly when there is also high humidity, and strenuous physical activity. • Without prompt treatment, heat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke, a life-threatening condition. • Fortunately, heat exhaustion is preventable.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly or progress over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise. • Possible heat exhaustion symptoms include: Cool, moist skin with goose bumps when in the heat. • Heavy sweating. • Faintness. • Dizziness. • Fatigue. • Weak, rapid pulse. • Low blood pressure upon standing. • Muscle cramps. • Nausea. • Headache. • If you think you have heat exhaustion: Stop all activity and rest. • Move to a cooler place. • Drink cool water or sports drinks. • Contact your doctor if your symptoms get worse or they don't improve within one hour. • If you're with someone who has heat exhaustion, seek immediate medical help if they become confused or distressed, lose consciousness, or are unable to drink. • If their core body temperature — measured by a rectal thermometer — reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher, they need immediate cooling and urgent medical attention. • The body's heat combined with environmental heat results in what's called your core temperature. • This is your body's inner temperature. • Your body needs to regulate heat gain in hot weather or heat loss in cold weather to keep a core temperature that's typical for you. • The average core temperature is about 98.6 F (37 C). • In hot weather, your body cools itself mainly by sweating. • The evaporation of your sweat regulates your body temperature. • But when you exercise strenuously or otherwise overexert in hot, humid weather, your body is less able to cool itself efficiently. • As a result, heat cramps may start in your body. • Heat cramps are the mildest form of heat-related illness. • Symptoms of heat cramps often include heavy sweating, fatigue, thirst and muscle cramps. • Prompt treatment may prevent heat cramps from progressing to more-serious heat illnesses such as heat exhaustion. • Drinking fluids or sports drinks that have electrolytes (Gatorade, Powerade, others) can help treat heat cramps. • Other treatments for heat cramps include getting into cooler temperatures, such as an air-conditioned or shaded place, and resting. • Besides hot weather and strenuous activity, other causes of heat exhaustion include: Dehydration, which lessens your body's ability to sweat and keep a normal temperature. • Alcohol use, which can affect your body's ability to regulate your temperature. • Overdressing, particularly in clothes that don't allow sweat to evaporate easily. • Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. • They include: Young age or old age. • Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion. • The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in children. • In older adults, illness, medicines or other factors can affect the body's ability to control temperature. • Certain drugs. • Some medicines can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat. • These include some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics). • Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature. • Obesity. • Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to keep more heat. • Sudden temperature changes. • If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion. • The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures. • Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that experiences an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness. • The body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures. • A high heat index. • The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel. • When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily, and your body has more trouble cooling itself. • This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. • When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool. • If heat exhaustion isn't treated, it can lead to heatstroke. • Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. • It happens when your core body temperature reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher. • Heatstroke needs immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other vital organs that can result in death. • There are a lot of things you can do to prevent heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses. • When temperatures climb, remember to: Wear loose fitting, lightweight clothing. • Wearing too much clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly. • Protect against sunburn. • Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself. • Protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. • Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours. • Reapply more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Drink plenty of fluids. • Staying hydrated helps your body sweat and keep a normal body temperature. • Be careful with certain medicines. • Watch for heat-related problems if you take medicines that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. • Never leave anyone in a parked car. • This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. • When parked in the sun, the temperature in your car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 11 C) in 10 minutes. • It's not safe to leave someone in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. • Keep parked cars locked to prevent a child from getting inside. • Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day. • If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest often in a cool spot. • Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening. • Get acclimated. • Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it. • People who aren't used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness. • It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather. • Be cautious if you're at increased risk. • If you take medicines or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, such as a history of prior heat illness, be cautious. • Avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating. • If you take part in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services ready in case of a heat emergency.",

      "Risk factors": "Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. • They include: Young age or old age. • Infants and children younger than 4 and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of heat exhaustion. • The body's ability to regulate its temperature isn't fully developed in children. • In older adults, illness, medicines or other factors can affect the body's ability to control temperature. • Certain drugs. • Some medicines can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond properly to heat. • These include some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems (beta blockers, diuretics), reduce allergy symptoms (antihistamines), calm you (tranquilizers), or reduce psychiatric symptoms such as delusions (antipsychotics). • Some illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can increase your core temperature. • Obesity. • Carrying excess weight can affect your body's ability to regulate its temperature and cause your body to keep more heat. • Sudden temperature changes. • If you're not used to the heat, you're more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion. • The body needs time to get used to higher temperatures. • Traveling to a warm climate from a cold one or living in an area that experiences an early heat wave can put you at risk of a heat-related illness. • The body hasn't had a chance to get used to the higher temperatures. • A high heat index. • The heat index is a single temperature value that considers how both the outdoor temperature and humidity make you feel. • When the humidity is high, your sweat can't evaporate as easily, and your body has more trouble cooling itself. • This makes you more prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. • When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher, you should take precautions to keep cool.",
      "Complications": "If heat exhaustion isn't treated, it can lead to heatstroke. • Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. • It happens when your core body temperature reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher. • Heatstroke needs immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other vital organs that can result in death.",
      "Prevention": "There are a lot of things you can do to prevent heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses. • When temperatures climb, remember to: Wear loose fitting, lightweight clothing. • Wearing too much clothing or clothing that fits tightly won't allow your body to cool properly. • Protect against sunburn. • Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself. • Protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. • Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. • Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours. • Reapply more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Drink plenty of fluids. • Staying hydrated helps your body sweat and keep a normal body temperature. • Be careful with certain medicines. • Watch for heat-related problems if you take medicines that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. • Never leave anyone in a parked car. • This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. • When parked in the sun, the temperature in your car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 11 C) in 10 minutes. • It's not safe to leave someone in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. • Keep parked cars locked to prevent a child from getting inside. • Take it easy during the hottest parts of the day. • If you can't avoid strenuous activity in hot weather, drink fluids and rest often in a cool spot. • Try to schedule exercise or physical labor for cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or evening. • Get acclimated. • Limit time spent working or exercising in heat until you're conditioned to it. • People who aren't used to hot weather are especially susceptible to heat-related illness. • It can take several weeks for your body to adjust to hot weather. • Be cautious if you're at increased risk. • If you take medicines or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, such as a history of prior heat illness, be cautious. • Avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating. • If you take part in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services ready in case of a heat emergency."

      "Overview": "Heatstroke is a condition caused by the body overheating. • This usually happens because of exposure to high temperatures or physical activity in high temperatures for too long. • There are a few stages of heat injury, and heatstroke is the most serious. • It can happen if body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. • Heatstroke is most common in the summer months. • Heatstroke needs emergency care. • If it's not treated, heatstroke can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. • This damage gets worse the longer treatment is delayed, which increases the risk of serious complications or death.",
      "Symptoms": "Heatstroke symptoms include: High body temperature. • A core body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) or higher is the main sign of heatstroke. • Change in mental state or behavior. • Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke. • Change in sweating pattern. • In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, skin feels hot and dry to the touch. • However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, sweating may be profuse. • Nausea and vomiting. • Someone with heatstroke may feel sick to their stomach or vomit. • Flushed skin. • Skin may turn red as body temperature increases. • Rapid breathing. • Breathing may become rapid and shallow. • Racing heart rate. • Pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places an extreme burden on the heart to help cool the body. • Headache. • Heatstroke may cause the head to throb. • If you think a person may be experiencing heatstroke, seek immediate medical help. • Call 911 or your local emergency services number. • Take immediate action to cool the person with heatstroke while waiting for emergency treatment. • Get the person into shade or indoors. • Remove excess clothing. • Cool the person with whatever means available — put in a cool tub of water or a cool shower, spray with a garden hose, sponge with cool water, fan while misting with cool water, or place ice packs or cold, wet towels on the person's head, neck, armpits and groin. • Heatstroke can happen as a result of: Being in a hot environment. • In a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional (classic) heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in core body temperature. • This type of heatstroke typically happens after exposure to hot, humid weather, especially for a long period of time. • It happens most often in older adults and in people with ongoing health conditions. • Doing strenuous activity. • Exertional heatstroke is caused by an increase in core body temperature brought on by intense physical activity in hot weather. • Anyone exercising or working in hot weather can get exertional heatstroke, but it's most likely to happen if you're not used to high temperatures. • In either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by: Wearing heavy clothing that prevents sweat from evaporating easily and cooling the body. • Drinking alcohol, which can affect the body's ability to regulate temperature. • Becoming dehydrated by not drinking enough water to replenish fluids lost through sweating. • Anyone can develop heatstroke, but several factors increase your risk: Age. • The ability to cope with extreme heat depends on the strength of the central nervous system. • In the very young, the central nervous system is not fully developed. • In adults over 65, the central nervous system becomes less responsive, which makes the body less able to cope with changes in body temperature. • Both age groups usually have difficulty remaining hydrated, which also increases risk. • Exertion in hot weather. • Military training and participating in sports, such as football or long-distance running events, in hot weather are among the situations that can lead to heatstroke. • Sudden exposure to hot weather. • People may be more susceptible to heat-related illness when they're exposed to a sudden increase in temperature, such as during an early-summer heat wave or travel to a hotter climate. • Limit activity for at least several days to allow time to acclimate to the temperature change. • However, there may still be an increased risk of heatstroke until a person experiences several weeks of higher temperatures. • A lack of air conditioning. • Fans may make you feel better, but during sustained hot weather, air conditioning is the most effective way to cool down and lower humidity. • Certain medicines. • Some medicines affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. • Be especially careful in hot weather if you take medicines that narrow your blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate your blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid your body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics). • Stimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illegal stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine also make you more vulnerable to heatstroke. • Certain health conditions. • Certain chronic illnesses, such as heart or lung disease, might increase your risk of heatstroke. • So can being overweight, being inactive and having a history of previous heatstroke. • Heatstroke can result in a number of complications, depending on how long the body temperature is high. • Serious complications include: Vital organ damage. • Without a quick response to lower the body temperature, heatstroke can cause the brain or other vital organs to swell, possibly resulting in permanent damage. • Death. • Without prompt and adequate treatment, heatstroke can be fatal. • Heatstroke is predictable and preventable. • Take these steps to prevent heatstroke during hot weather: Wear loose-fitting, lightweight clothing. • Excess clothing or clothing that fits tightly doesn't allow your body to cool properly. • Clothes made of linen, silk, cotton or hemp are cooling. • Protect against sunburn. • Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself, so protect yourself outdoors with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. • And use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. • Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. • Drink plenty of fluids. • Stay hydrated to help your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature. • Take extra precautions with certain medicines. • Be on the lookout for heat-related problems if you take medicines that can affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and dissipate heat. • Never leave anyone in a parked car. • This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. • When a car is parked in the sun, the temperature in the car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 11 degrees Celsius) in 10 minutes. • It's not safe to leave a person in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. • When your

      "Overview": "Some women have menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for more than a few days. • This condition used to be called menorrhagia. • Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern. • But most women don't have enough blood loss for it to be called heavy menstrual bleeding. • Some women have menstrual bleeding between periods, or earlier or later in their cycles than expected. • This type of bleeding is called abnormal uterine bleeding or irregular menstrual bleeding. • With heavy menstrual bleeding, blood flow and cramping make it harder to do your usual activities. • If you dread your period because you have heavy menstrual bleeding, talk with your doctor. • There are many treatments that can help.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding may include: Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several hours in a row. • Needing double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow. • Getting up at night to change sanitary pads or tampons. • Bleeding for more than a week. • Passing blood clots larger than a quarter. • Limiting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flow. • Feeling tired, fatigued or short of breath as the result of blood loss. • Seek medical help before your next scheduled exam if you have: Vaginal bleeding so heavy it soaks at least one pad or tampon an hour for more than two hours in a row. • Bleeding between periods or unusual vaginal bleeding. • Vaginal bleeding after menopause. • In some cases, the reason for heavy menstrual bleeding is unknown. • But a number of conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. • They include: Hormones being out of balance. • In a typical menstrual cycle, there's a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. • This controls the buildup of the lining of the uterus. • The lining of the uterus also is known as the endometrium. • This lining is shed during a menstrual period. • When hormones are out of balance, the lining becomes too thick and sheds by way of heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods. • A number of conditions can cause hormone imbalances. • These include obesity, insulin resistance, thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome, which also is called PCOS. • Problems with the ovaries. • Sometimes ovaries don't release an egg during a menstrual cycle. • This also is known as anovulation. • When this happens, the body doesn't make the hormone progesterone the way it usually does during a menstrual cycle. • This leads to hormone imbalance and may result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods. • Uterine fibroids. • These tumors develop during childbearing years. • They are benign, which means they are not cancerous. • Uterine fibroids may cause heavier than normal menstrual bleeding or bleeding that goes on for a long time. • Polyps. • These small growths on the lining of the uterus may cause menstrual bleeding that is heavy or lasts for a long time. • They may cause bleeding between periods. • Polyps also can cause spotting or bleeding after menopause. • The growths are not cancerous. • Adenomyosis. • In this condition, glands from the lining of the uterus grow into the wall of the uterus itself. • This can cause heavy bleeding and painful periods. • Intrauterine device, also called an IUD. • Heavy menstrual bleeding is a well-known side effect of using a hormone-free IUD for birth control. • Talk to your doctor about other birth control options. • IUDs with progestin may ease heavy menstrual bleeding. • Pregnancy complications. • A single, heavy, late period may be due to a miscarriage. • Another cause of heavy bleeding during pregnancy includes the unusual location of the placenta, which supplies nutrition to the baby and removes waste. • The placenta may be too low or covering the opening of the uterus, which is called the cervix. • This condition also is known as placenta previa. • Cancer. • Cancer of the uterus or cervix can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, unexpected or heavy menstrual bleeding. • These cancers can happen before or after menopause. • Women who have had an abnormal Pap test in the past are at higher risk of cervical cancer. • Genetic bleeding disorders. • Some bleeding disorders that run in families cause heavy menstrual bleeding. • These include von Willebrand's disease, a condition in which the blood does not clot properly. • Medicines. • Some medicines can result in heavy or lengthy menstrual bleeding. • These include hormonal medicines such as birth control pills that have estrogen and progestin. • These medicines typically help lessen menstrual bleeding but sometimes cause unexpected bleeding between periods. • Medicines that prevent blood clots also may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. • They include warfarin (Jantoven), enoxaparin (Lovenox), apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). • Other medical conditions. • A number of other medical conditions may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. • They include liver, kidney and thyroid disease. • Risk factors vary with age and the medical conditions you have. • Usually, the release of an egg from the ovaries signals the body to make progesterone. • Progesterone is the hormone most responsible for keeping periods regular. • If no egg is released, the body does not make enough progesterone. • This can result in heavy menstrual bleeding or unexpected bleeding between periods. • In teenagers, an irregular period or heavy menstrual bleeding often happens when an egg is not released during a monthly cycle. • Teenagers are most likely to have cycles without an egg release during the first year after they have their first period. • In older women of reproductive age, heavy menstrual bleeding is often caused by problems with the uterus. • These include fibroids, polyps and adenomyosis. • But other problems also could cause heavy menstrual bleeding. • Examples include cancer of the uterus, bleeding disorders, side effects of medicines, and liver or kidney disease. • Menstrual bleeding that is too heavy or lasts too long can lead to other medical conditions. • These include: Anemia. • Heavy menstrual bleeding can cause anemia related to blood loss. • Anemia is a condition in which the body lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues. • The number of red blood cells is measured by hemoglobin. • Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues throughout the body. • Iron deficiency anemia occurs as the body tries to make up for lost red blood cells. • The body uses iron stores to make more hemoglobin so that enough oxygen can be carried to tissues. • Heavy menstrual bleeding may make iron levels too low. • This may result in iron deficiency anemia. • Symptoms include headaches and feeling tired. • Although diet plays a role in iron deficiency anemia, the problem is made worse by heavy menstrual periods. • Severe pain. • Along with heavy menstrual bleeding, you might have painful menstrual cramps. • This also is known as dysmenorrhea. • Talk to your doctor if your cramps make it hard to do your daily activities.",

      "Symptoms": "A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. • It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. • A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark. • During your child's first year, the red mark may grow rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. • The hemangioma then enters a rest phase. • Then it will begin to slowly go away. • Many hemangiomas go away by age 5, and most go away by age 10. • The skin may be slightly discolored or raised after the hemangioma goes away. • Your child's health care provider will check the hemangioma during routine visits. • Contact your child's health care provider if the hemangioma bleeds, forms a sore or looks infected. • Seek medical care if the condition causes problems with an important bodily function, such as your child's vision, breathing, hearing or ability to go to the bathroom.",
      "Causes": "A hemangioma is made up of extra blood vessels that group together into a dense clump. • What causes the vessels to clump isn't known.",
      "Risk factors": "Hemangiomas occur more often in babies who are female, white or born prematurely. • Babies with a low birth weight also are more likely to have a hemangioma.",
      "Complications": "At times, a hemangioma can break down and develop a sore. • This can lead to pain, bleeding, scarring or infection. • Depending on the hemangioma's location, it may cause problems with your child's vision, breathing, hearing or ability to go to the bathroom. • But this is rare."

      "Symptoms": "Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often: On one side of the face. • Not controllable. • Painless. • These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. • Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. • At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. • But over months to years, they occur almost all the time. • Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. • However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time.",
      "Causes": "A blood vessel touching a facial nerve is the most common cause of hemifacial spasm. • A facial nerve injury or a tumor also can cause it. • Sometimes the cause isn't known. • Hemifacial spasm sometimes starts as a result of: Moving the muscles in the face. • Anxiety. • Stress. • Being tired."

      "Overview": "Hemochromatosis (he-moe-kroe-muh-TOE-sis) is a condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. • Excess iron is stored in the organs, especially the liver, heart and pancreas. • Too much iron can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and diabetes. • There are a few types of hemochromatosis, but the most common type is caused by a gene change passed down through families. • Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems. • Symptoms usually appear in midlife. • Treatment includes regularly removing blood from the body. • Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.",
      "Symptoms": "Some people with hemochromatosis never have symptoms. • Early symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions. • Symptoms may include: Joint pain. • Belly pain. • Fatigue. • Weakness. • Diabetes. • Loss of sex drive. • Impotence. • Heart failure. • Liver failure. • Bronze or gray skin color. • Memory fog. • The most common type of hemochromatosis is present at birth. • But most people don't experience symptoms until later in life — usually after age 40 in men and after age 60 in women. • Women are more likely to develop symptoms after menopause, when they no longer lose iron with menstruation and pregnancy. • See a healthcare professional if you experience any of the symptoms of hemochromatosis. • If you have an immediate family member who has hemochromatosis, ask your healthcare team about genetic testing. • Genetic testing can check if you have the gene that increases your risk of hemochromatosis. • Hemochromatosis is most often caused by a change in a gene. • This gene controls the amount of iron the body absorbs from food. • The altered gene is passed from parents to children. • This type of hemochromatosis is by far the most common type. • It's called hereditary hemochromatosis. • A gene called HFE is most often the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis. • You inherit one HFE gene from each of your parents. • The HFE gene has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D. • Genetic testing can reveal whether you have these changes in your HFE gene. • If you inherit two altered genes, you may develop hemochromatosis. • You also can pass the altered gene on to your children. • But not everyone who inherits two genes develops problems linked to the iron overload of hemochromatosis. • If you inherit one altered gene, you're unlikely to develop hemochromatosis. • However, you are considered a carrier and can pass the altered gene on to your children. • But your children wouldn't develop the disease unless they also inherited another altered gene from the other parent. • Iron plays an important role in several body functions, including helping to produce blood. • But too much iron is toxic. • A hormone secreted by the liver, called hepcidin, controls how iron is used and absorbed in the body. • It also controls how excess iron is stored in various organs. • In hemochromatosis, the role of hepcidin is affected, causing the body to absorb more iron than it needs. • This excess iron is stored in major organs, especially the liver. • Over a period of years, the stored iron can cause severe damage that may lead to organ failure. • It also can lead to long-lasting diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure. • Many people have gene changes that cause hemochromatosis. • However, not everyone develops iron overload to a degree that causes tissue and organ damage. • Hereditary hemochromatosis isn't the only type of hemochromatosis. • Other types include: Juvenile hemochromatosis. • This causes the same problems in young people that hereditary hemochromatosis causes in adults. • But iron buildup begins much earlier, and symptoms usually appear between the ages of 15 and 30. • This condition is caused by changes in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes. • Neonatal hemochromatosis. • In this serious disease, iron builds up quickly in the liver of the developing baby in the womb. • It is thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. • Secondary hemochromatosis. • This form of the disease is not inherited and is often referred to as iron overload. • People with certain types of anemia or liver disease may often need multiple blood transfusions. • This can lead to excess iron buildup. • Factors that increase the risk of hemochromatosis include: Having two copies of an altered HFE gene. • This is the greatest risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis. • Family history. • Having a parent or sibling with hemochromatosis increases the likelihood of developing the disease. • Ethnicity. • People of Northern European descent are more prone to hereditary hemochromatosis than are people of other ethnic backgrounds. • Hemochromatosis is less common in people of Black, Hispanic and Asian ancestry. • Sex. • Men are more likely than women to develop symptoms of hemochromatosis at an earlier age. • Because women lose iron through menstruation and pregnancy, they tend to store less of the mineral than men do. • After menopause or a hysterectomy, the risk increases for women. • Untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to several complications. • These complications especially affect the joints and organs where excess iron tends to be stored, such as the liver, pancreas and heart. • Complications can include: Liver issues. • Cirrhosis — permanent scarring of the liver — is just one of the complications that may happen. • Cirrhosis increases the risk of liver cancer and other life-threatening complications. • Diabetes. • Damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes. • Heart problems. • Excess iron in the heart affects the heart's ability to circulate enough blood for the body's needs. • This is called congestive heart failure. • Hemochromatosis also can cause irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias. • Reproductive problems. • Excess iron can lead to erectile dysfunction and loss of sex drive in men. • It can cause an absence of the menstrual cycle in women. • Skin color changes. • Deposits of iron in skin cells can make the skin appear bronze or gray in color.",

      "Overview": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition that can occur when small blood vessels become damaged and inflamed. • This damage can cause clots to form in the vessels all through the body. • The clots can damage the kidneys and other organs. • Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening. • Anyone can get hemolytic uremic syndrome. • But it's most common in young children. • Most often, infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria is the cause. • Other infections, certain medicines or conditions such as pregnancy, cancer or autoimmune diseases can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome. • It also can be the result of certain gene changes. • Hemolytic uremic syndrome is serious. • But treating it in time leads to a full recovery for most people, especially young children.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. • The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include: Diarrhea, which is often bloody. • Pain, cramping or bloating in the stomach area. • Fever. • Vomiting. • All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. • This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. • The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys. • Symptoms of these changes include: Loss of color in the skin. • Extreme tiredness. • Easy bruising. • Unusual bleeding, such as bleeding from the nose and mouth. • Decreased urinating or blood in the urine. • Swelling, called edema, of the legs, feet or ankles. • Swelling occurs less often in the face, hands, feet or entire body. • Confusion, seizures or stroke. • High blood pressure. • See a member of your health care team right away if you or your child has bloody diarrhea or several days of diarrhea followed by: Urinating less. • Swelling. • Bruising. • Unusual bleeding. • Extreme tiredness. • Seek emergency care if you or your child doesn't urinate for 12 hours or more.",
      "Causes": "The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome is infection with certain strains of E. coli bacteria. • This is especially true for children under age 5. • Some of the E. coli strains make a toxin called Shiga toxin. • These strains are called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). • Most of the hundreds of types of E. coli are typical and harmless. • But some strains of E. coli can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome. • Other causes of hemolytic uremic syndrome can include: Other infections. • This can include infection with pneumococcal bacteria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or a flu virus. • Certain medicines. • These can include some of the medicines used to treat cancer and some medicines used to keep people who receive donor organs from rejecting the organs. • Complications of other conditions. • Rarely, these conditions can include pregnancy or conditions such as autoimmune disease or cancer. • An uncommon type of hemolytic uremic syndrome, called atypical, can be passed down through families. • People who inherit the gene that causes this form of hemolytic uremic syndrome don't always get the condition. • But an infection, the use of certain medicines or ongoing health conditions can start hemolytic uremic syndrome in people with the gene.",
      "Risk factors": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E.coli can occur if you: Eat meat, fruit or vegetables with the bacteria. • Swim in pools or lakes that have feces with the bacteria. • Have close contact with an infected person. • The risk of getting hemolytic uremic syndrome is highest for: Children 5 or younger. • People who have weakened immune systems. • People with certain gene changes.",
      "Complications": "Hemolytic uremic syndrome can cause life-threatening complications, including: Kidney failure, which can be sudden, called acute, or happen over time, called chronic. • High blood pressure. • Stroke or seizures. • Coma. • Clotting problems, which can lead to bleeding. • Heart problems. • Digestive tract problems, such as problems with the intestines, gallbladder or pancreas.",
      "Prevention": "Meat or produce that has E. coli won't always look, feel or smell bad. • To protect against E. coli infection and other illnesses from foods: Don't drink milk, juice or cider that isn't processed to make it safe to drink, called pasteurized. • Wash hands well before eating and after using the restroom and changing diapers. • Clean utensils and food surfaces often. • Cook meat to an inside temperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius). • Defrost meat in the microwave or refrigerator, not on the counter. • Keep raw foods separate from other foods. • Don't put cooked meat on plates that had raw meat on them. • Store meat below produce in the refrigerator to cut the risk of liquids such as blood dripping on produce. • Avoid unclean swimming areas. • Don't swim if you have diarrhea."

      "Overview": "Hemophilia is a rare disorder in which the blood doesn't clot in the typical way because it doesn't have enough blood-clotting proteins (clotting factors). • If you have hemophilia, you might bleed for a longer time after an injury than you would if your blood clotted properly. • Small cuts usually aren't much of a problem. • If you have a severe form of the condition, the main concern is bleeding inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows. • Internal bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and be life-threatening. • Hemophilia is almost always a genetic disorder. • Treatment includes regular replacement of the specific clotting factor that is reduced. • Newer therapies that don't contain clotting factors also are being used.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors. • If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. • If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason. • Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include: Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work Many large or deep bruises Unusual bleeding after vaccinations Pain, swelling or tightness in your joints Blood in your urine or stool Nosebleeds without a known cause In infants, unexplained irritability A simple bump on the head can cause bleeding into the brain for some people who have severe hemophilia. • This rarely happens, but it's one of the most serious complications that can occur. • Signs and symptoms include: Painful, prolonged headache Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or lethargy Double vision Sudden weakness or clumsiness Convulsions or seizures Seek emergency care if you or your child has: Signs or symptoms of bleeding into the brain An injury in which the bleeding won't stop Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend",
      "Causes": "When a person bleeds, the body typically pools blood cells together to form a clot to stop the bleeding. • Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work with cells known as platelets to form clots. • Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is missing or levels of the clotting factor are low. • Hemophilia is usually inherited, meaning a person is born with the disorder (congenital). • Congenital hemophilia is classified by the type of clotting factor that's low. • The most common type is hemophilia A, associated with a low level of factor 8 The next most common type is hemophilia B, associated with a low level of factor 9. • Some people develop hemophilia with no family history of the disorder. • This is called acquired hemophilia. • Acquired hemophilia is a variety of the condition that occurs when a person's immune system attacks clotting factor 8 or 9 in the blood. • It can be associated with: Pregnancy Autoimmune conditions Cancer Multiple sclerosis Drug reactions In the most common types of hemophilia, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. • Everyone has two sex chromosomes, one from each parent. • Females inherit an X chromosome from the mother and an X chromosome from the father. • Males inherit an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. • This means that hemophilia almost always occurs in boys and is passed from mother to son through one of the mother's genes. • Most women with the defective gene are carriers who have no signs or symptoms of hemophilia. • But some carriers can have bleeding symptoms if their clotting factors are moderately decreased.",
      "Risk factors": "The biggest risk factor for hemophilia is to have family members who also have the disorder. • Males are much more likely to have hemophilia than are females.",
      "Complications": "Complications of hemophilia can include: Deep internal bleeding. • Bleeding that occurs in deep muscle can cause the limbs to swell. • The swelling can press on nerves and lead to numbness or pain. • Depending on where the bleeding occurs, it could be life-threatening. • Bleeding into the throat or neck. • This can affect a person's ability to breathe. • Damage to joints. • Internal bleeding can put pressure on the joints, causing severe pain. • Left untreated, frequent internal bleeding can cause arthritis or destruction of the joint. • Infection. • If the clotting factors used to treat hemophilia come from human blood, there's an increased risk of viral infections such as hepatitis C. • Because of donor screening techniques, the risk is low. • Adverse reaction to clotting factor treatment. • In some people with severe hemophilia, the immune system has a negative reaction to the clotting factors used to treat bleeding. • When this happens, the immune system develops proteins that keep the clotting factors from working, making treatment less effective."

      "Overview": "Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum. • Hemorrhoids are similar to varicose veins. • Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum, called internal hemorrhoids. • They also can develop under the skin around the anus, called external hemorrhoids. • There are several options available to treat hemorrhoids. • Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle changes.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid. • Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. • You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. • But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause: Painless bleeding during bowel movements. • You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet. • A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening, called a prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid. • This may result in pain and irritation. • These are under the skin around the anus. • Symptoms might include: Itching or irritation in the anal region. • Pain or discomfort. • Swelling around the anus. • Bleeding. • Blood can pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot, called a thrombus. • A thrombosed hemorrhoid can result in: Severe pain. • Swelling. • Inflammation. • A hard, discolored lump near the anus. • If you have bleeding during bowel movements or you have hemorrhoids that don't improve after a week of home care, talk to your health care provider. • Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you have changes in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency. • Rectal bleeding can happen with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer. • Seek emergency care if you have large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness. • The veins around the anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. • Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to: Straining during bowel movements. • Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet. • Having chronic diarrhea or constipation. • Being obese. • Being pregnant. • Having anal intercourse. • Eating a low-fiber diet. • Regularly lifting heavy items. • As people age, the risk of hemorrhoids increases. • That's because the tissues that support the veins in the rectum and anus can weaken and stretch. • This also can happen during pregnancy because the baby's weight puts pressure on the anal region. • Complications of hemorrhoids are rare but may include: Anemia. • Rarely, ongoing blood loss from hemorrhoids may cause anemia. • Anemia is when there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's cells. • Strangulated hemorrhoid. • When the blood supply to an internal hemorrhoid is cut off, the hemorrhoid is called strangulated. • Strangulated hemorrhoids can cause extreme pain. • Blood clot. • Sometimes a clot can form in a hemorrhoid. • This is called a thrombosed hemorrhoid. • Although not dangerous, it can be extremely painful and sometimes needs to be drained. • The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep your stools soft so they pass easily. • To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids, follow these tips: Eat high-fiber foods. • Eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Doing so softens the stool and increases its bulk. • This will help you avoid the straining that can cause hemorrhoids. • Add fiber to your diet slowly to avoid problems with gas. • Drink plenty of fluids. • Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water and other liquids each day to help keep stools soft. • Avoiding alcohol also may help. • Consider fiber supplements. • Most people don't get enough fiber in their diets. • Studies have shown that nonprescription fiber supplements, such as psyllium (Metamucil, Konsyl, others) or methylcellulose (Citrucel), can lessen symptoms and bleeding from hemorrhoids. • If you use fiber supplements, be sure to drink at least eight glasses of water or other fluids every day. • Otherwise, the supplements can cause constipation or make it worse. • Don't strain. • Straining and holding your breath when trying to pass stool create greater pressure in the veins in the lower rectum. • Exercise. • Stay active to help prevent constipation and reduce pressure on veins. • Exercise also can help you lose excess weight that might be causing your hemorrhoids or making them worse. • Avoid long periods of sitting. • Sitting too long, especially on the toilet, can increase the pressure on the veins in the anus.",

      "Overview": "Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. • The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause liver inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function. • You're most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that's infected. • Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment. • Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage. • Practicing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, can prevent the spread of the virus. • The hepatitis A vaccine can protect against hepatitis A.",
      "Symptoms": "Hepatitis A symptoms typically appear a few weeks after you've had the virus. • But not everyone with hepatitis A develops symptoms. • If you do, symptoms can include: Unusual tiredness and weakness Sudden nausea and vomiting and diarrhea Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs, which is over your liver Clay- or gray-colored stool Loss of appetite Low-grade fever Dark urine Joint pain Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Intense itching These symptoms may be relatively mild and go away in a few weeks. • Sometimes, however, hepatitis A results in a severe illness that lasts several months. • Make an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of hepatitis A. • Getting the hepatitis A vaccine or an injection of an antibody called immunoglobulin within two weeks of exposure to the hepatitis A virus may protect you from infection. • Ask your health care provider or your local health department about receiving the hepatitis A vaccine if: You traveled recently to areas where the virus is common, particularly Mexico, Central America and South America or to areas with poor sanitation You ate at a restaurant with a hepatitis A outbreak You live with someone who has hepatitis A You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation. • The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other symptoms of hepatitis A. • The virus spreads when infected stool, even just tiny amounts, enters the mouth of another person (fecal-oral transmission). • You may get hepatitis A when you eat or drink something contaminated with infected stool. • You may also get the infection through close contact with a person who has hepatitis A. • The virus can live on surfaces for a few months. • The virus does not spread through casual contact or by sneezing or coughing. • Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread: Eating food handled by someone with the virus who doesn't thoroughly wash hands after using the toilet Drinking contaminated water Eating food washed in contaminated water Eating raw shellfish from water polluted with sewage Being in close contact with a person who has the virus — even if that person has no symptoms Having sexual contact with someone who has the virus You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is common Live with another person who has hepatitis A Are a man who has sexual contact with other men Have any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A Are HIV positive Are homeless Use any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage, and it doesn't become an ongoing (chronic) infection. • In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause a sudden (acute) loss of liver function, especially in older adults or people with chronic liver diseases. • Acute liver failure requires a stay in the hospital for monitoring and treatment. • Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant. • The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent infection with the virus. • The vaccine is typically given in two shots. • The first shot is followed by a booster shot six months later. • The hepatitis A vaccine can be given in a combination that includes the hepatitis B vaccine. • This vaccine combination is given in three shots over six months. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for the following people: All children at age 1 year, or older children who didn't receive the childhood vaccine Anyone age 1 year or older who is homeless Infants ages 6 to 11 months traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A is common Family and caregivers of adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common People in direct contact with others who have hepatitis A Laboratory workers who may come into contact with hepatitis A Men who have sex with men People who work or travel in parts of the world where hepatitis A is common People who use any type of recreational drugs, not just injected ones People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C Anyone wishing to obtain protection (immunity) If you're concerned about your risk of hepatitis A, ask your health care provider if you should be vaccinated. • If you're traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A outbreaks occur, take these steps to prevent infection: Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables in bottled water and peel them yourself. • Avoid pre-cut fruit and vegetables. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meat and fish. • Drink bottled water and use it when brushing your teeth. • Avoid all beverages of unknown purity. • The same goes for ice. • If bottled water isn't available, boil tap water before drinking it or using it to make ice. • Thoroughly wash your hands often, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating.",
      "Causes": "Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation. • The inflammation can affect how your liver works and cause other symptoms of hepatitis A. • The virus spreads when infected stool, even just tiny amounts, enters the mouth of another person (fecal-oral transmission). • You may get hepatitis A when you eat or drink something contaminated with infected stool. • You may also get the infection through close contact with a person who has hepatitis A. • The virus can live on surfaces for a few months. • The virus does not spread through casual contact or by sneezing or coughing. • Here are some of the specific ways the hepatitis A virus can spread: Eating food handled by someone with the virus who doesn't thoroughly wash hands after using the toilet Drinking contaminated water Eating food washed in contaminated water Eating raw shellfish from water polluted with sewage Being in close contact with a person who has the virus — even if that person has no symptoms Having sexual contact with someone who has the virus",
      "Risk factors": "You're at increased risk of hepatitis A if you: Travel or work in areas of the world where hepatitis A is common Live with another person who has hepatitis A Are a man who has sexual contact with other men Have any type of sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A Are HIV positive Are homeless Use any type of recreational drugs, not just those that are injected",
      "Complications": "Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A does not cause long-term liver damage, and it doesn't become an ongoing (chronic) infection. • In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause a sudden (acute) loss of liver function, especially in older adults or people with chronic liver diseases. • Acute liver failure requires a stay in the hospital for monitoring and treatment. • Some people with acute liver failure may need a liver transplant.",
      "Prevention": "The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent infection with the virus. • The vaccine is typically given in two shots. • The first shot is followed by a booster shot six months later. • The hepatitis A vaccine can be given in a combination that includes the hepatitis B vaccine. • This vaccine combination is given in three shots over six months. • The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for the following people: All children at age 1 year, or older children who didn't receive the childhood vaccine Anyone age 1 year or older who is homeless Infants ages 6 to 11 months traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A is common Family and caregivers of adoptees from countries where hepatitis A is common People in direct contact with others who have hepatitis A Laboratory workers who may come into contact with hepatitis A Men who have sex with men People who work or travel in parts of the world where hepatitis A is common People who use any type of recreational drugs, not just injected ones People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C Anyone wishing to obtain protection (immunity) If you're concerned about your risk of hepatitis A, ask your health care provider if you should be vaccinated. • If you're traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A outbreaks occur, take these steps to prevent infection: Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables in bottled water and peel them yourself. • Avoid pre-cut fruit and vegetables. • Don't eat raw or undercooked meat and fish. • Drink bottled water and use it when brushing your teeth. • Avoid all beverages of unknown purity. • The same goes for ice. • If bottled water isn't available, boil tap water before drinking it or using it to make ice. • Thoroughly wash your hands often, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating."

      "Overview": "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). • For most people, hepatitis B is short term, also called acute. • Acute hepatitis B lasts less than six months. • But for others, the infection lasts more than six months and is called chronic. • Chronic hepatitis B raises the risk of liver failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. • Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are bad. • Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic, long-lasting hepatitis B virus infection. • A vaccine can prevent infection with the hepatitis B virus. • For those who get infected, treatment depends on whether the infection is acute or chronic. • Some people need medicine. • Others with serious liver damage from a chronic infection need a liver transplant. • If you're infected, taking certain safety measures can help prevent spreading the virus to others.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of acute hepatitis B range from mild to serious. • The symptoms usually start about 1 to 4 months after you've been infected with HBV. • But you could notice them as early as two weeks after you're infected. • Some people with acute or chronic hepatitis B may not have any symptoms, especially young children. • Hepatitis B symptoms may include: Pain in the stomach area, also called the abdomen. • Dark urine. • Fever. • Joint pain. • Loss of appetite. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Weakness and extreme tiredness. • Jaundice, which is a yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin. • Depending on skin color, this change may be harder or easier to see. • If you know you've been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, call your healthcare professional right away. • A preventive treatment may lower your risk of infection if you get the treatment within 24 hours of exposure to the virus. • If you think you have symptoms of hepatitis B, call your healthcare professional. • Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). • The virus passes from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids. • It does not spread by sneezing or coughing. • Common ways that HBV can spread are: Sexual contact. • You may get hepatitis B if you have sex with someone who is infected and you don't use a condom. • The virus can pass to you if the person's blood, saliva, semen or vaginal fluids enter your body. • Sharing of needles. • HBV easily spreads through needles and syringes that are tainted with infected blood. • Sharing equipment used to inject illicit drugs puts you at high risk of hepatitis B. • Accidental needlesticks. • Hepatitis B is a concern for healthcare workers and anyone else who comes in contact with human blood. • Pregnant person to newborn. • Pregnant people infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. • But the newborn can be vaccinated to prevent getting infected in almost all cases. • Talk with your healthcare professional about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant. • HBV infection may be short-lived, also called acute. • Or it might last a long time, also known as chronic. • Acute HBV infection lasts less than six months. • Your immune system likely can clear the hepatitis B virus from your body. • You should recover fully within a few months. • Most people who get HBV infections as adults have an acute infections. • But these can lead to a chronic infections. • Chronic HBV infection lasts six months or longer. • It lingers because the immune system can't fight off the infection. • Chronic hepatitis B virus infection may last a lifetime. • It can lead to serious illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. • Some people with chronic hepatitis B may have no symptoms at all. • Some may have ongoing tiredness and mild symptoms of acute hepatitis. • The younger you are when you get hepatitis B, the higher your risk of the condition becoming chronic. • That's especially true for newborns or children younger than 5. • Chronic hepatitis B may not be detected for decades until a person becomes very ill from liver disease. • The hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with blood, semen or other body fluids from an infected person. • Your risk of HBV infection rises if you: Have sex without a condom with multiple sex partners or with someone who's infected with HBV. • Share needles during the use of drugs injected into a vein. • Are born male and have sex with men. • Live with someone who has a chronic HBV infection. • Are an infant who was born to an infected pregnant person. • Have a job that exposes you to human blood. • Have hepatitis C or HIV. • Receive dialysis treatment. • Are or have been in prison. • Need to take medicine that can weaken the immune system, such as chemotherapy. • Travel to regions with high infection rates of HBV, such as Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa and Eastern Europe. • Having a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious health conditions called complications. • These include: Scarring of the liver, also called cirrhosis. • Swelling called inflammation is linked with hepatitis B. • The inflammation can lead to cirrhosis that may prevent the liver from working as it should. • Liver cancer. • People with chronic hepatitis B have a higher risk of liver cancer. • Liver failure. • Acute liver failure is a condition in which the vital functions of the liver shut down. • When that happens, a liver transplant is needed to stay alive. • Sudden increase in the level of hepatitis B virus. • In some people with chronic hepatitis B, levels of the virus are low or haven't yet been found by tests. • If the virus starts to quickly make copies of itself, tests may spot this rise or find the virus. • This is called reactivation of the virus. • It can lead to liver damage or even liver failure. • Reactivation tends to affect people who have weakened immune systems, also called suppressed immune systems. • This includes people on medicines that weakens the immune system, such as high-dose corticosteroids or chemotherapy. • Before taking these medicines, you should be tested for hepatitis B. • If testing shows that you have hepatitis B, see a liver specialist called a hepatologist before you start these medicines. • Other conditions. • People with chronic hepatitis B may develop kidney disease or inflammation of blood vessels. • The hepatitis B vaccine is the main way to prevent infection with HBV. • The vaccine is given as two shots one month apart, or three or four shots over six months. • How many shots you get depends on the type of hepatitis B vaccine that you're given. • You can't get hepatitis B from the vaccine. • In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that infants get their first shot of the vaccine after they're born. • If you didn't get vaccinated as a baby or child, the committee still recommends the vaccine for everyone through age 59. • If you're age 60 or older and haven't gotten vaccinated, get the vaccine if you're at risk of being exposed to the hepatitis B virus. • People 60 and over who haven't been vaccinated and are not at high risk also can choose to get the vaccine. • The hepatitis B vaccine is strongly recommended for: Newborns. • Children and adolescents not vaccinated at birth. • Those who work or live in centers for people who have developmental disabilities. • People who live with someone who has hepatitis B. • Healthcare workers, emergency workers and other people who come into contact with blood. • Anyone who has a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV. • People born male who have sex with men. • People who have multiple sexual partners. • Sexual partners of someone who has hepatitis B. • People who inject street drugs or share needles and syringes. • People with chronic liver disease. • People with end-stage kidney disease. • Travelers planning to go to an area of the world with a high HBV infection rate. • Other ways to lower your risk of infection with the hepatitis B virus include: Know the HBV status of any sexual partner. • Don't have sex without a condom unless you know that your partner doesn't have hepatitis B or another sexually transmitted infection. • Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you don't know the health status of your partner. • Condoms can lower your risk of catching HBV, but they don't get rid of the risk completely. • Don't use street drugs. • If you use drugs, get help to stop. • If you can't stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject drugs. • Never share needles. • Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing. • If you want to get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop. • Ask about how the equipment is cleaned. • Make sure the employees use sterile needles. • If you can't get answers, look for another shop. • Ask about the hepatitis B vaccine before you travel. • If you're traveling to a region where hepatitis B is common, ask your healthcare professional about the hepatitis B vaccine in advance. • It's usually given in a series of three shots over a six-month period.",

      "Symptoms": "Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, but they also can occur in the neck. • Symptoms depend on where the disk is sitting and whether the disk is pressing on a nerve. • Herniated disks often affect one side of the body. • Arm or leg pain. • If your herniated disk is in your lower back, you'll typically feel pain in your lower back, buttocks, thigh and calf. • You might have pain in part of your foot as well. • For a herniated disk in your neck, you'll typically feel the most pain in your shoulder and arm. • This pain might shoot into your arm or leg when you cough, sneeze or move into certain positions. • Pain is often described as sharp or burning. • Numbness or tingling. • People who have herniated disks often have radiating numbness or tingling in the body part served by the affected nerves. • Weakness. • Muscles served by the affected nerves tend to weaken. • This can cause you to stumble or affect your ability to lift or hold items. • You can have a herniated disk without symptoms. • You might not know you have it unless it shows up on a spinal image. • Seek medical care if your neck or back pain travels down your arm or leg, or if you also have numbness, tingling or weakness. • Disk herniation is most often the result of a gradual, aging-related wear and tear called disk degeneration. • As people age, the disks become less flexible and more prone to tearing or rupturing with even a minor strain or twist. • Most people can't pinpoint the cause of their herniated disk. • Sometimes, using the back muscles instead of the leg and thigh muscles to lift heavy objects can lead to a herniated disk. • Twisting and turning while lifting also can cause a herniated disk. • Rarely, a traumatic event such as a fall or a blow to the back is the cause. • Factors that can increase the risk of a herniated disk include: Weight. • Excess body weight causes extra stress on the disks in the lower back. • Occupation. • People with physically demanding jobs have a greater risk of back problems. • Repetitive lifting, pulling, pushing, bending sideways and twisting also can increase the risk of a herniated disk. • Genetics. • Some people inherit a predisposition to developing a herniated disk. • Smoking. • It's thought that smoking lessens the oxygen supply to disks, causing them to break down more quickly. • Frequent driving. • Being seated for long periods combined with the vibration from a motor vehicle engine can put pressure on the spine. • Being sedentary. • Regular exercise can help prevent a herniated disk. • Just above your waist, your spinal cord ends. • What continues through the spinal canal is a group of long nerve roots that resembles a horse's tail, called the cauda equina. • Rarely, disk herniation can compress the entire spinal canal, including all the nerves of the cauda equina. • In rare instances, emergency surgery might be needed to avoid permanent weakness or paralysis. • Seek emergency medical attention if you have: Worsening symptoms. • Pain, numbness or weakness can increase to the point that they hamper your daily activities. • Bladder or bowel dysfunction. • Cauda equina syndrome can cause incontinence or trouble urinating even with a full bladder. • Saddle anesthesia. • This progressive loss of sensation affects the areas that would touch a saddle — the inner thighs, the backs of the legs and the area around the rectum. • To help prevent a herniated disk, do the following: Exercise. • Strengthening the trunk muscles stabilizes and supports the spine. • Maintain good posture. • This reduces pressure on your spine and disks. • Keep your back straight and aligned, particularly when sitting for long periods. • Lift heavy objects properly, making your legs — not your back — do most of the work. • Maintain a healthy weight. • Excess weight puts more pressure on the spine and disks, making them more susceptible to herniation. • Quit smoking. • Avoid the use of any tobacco products. • Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. • See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.",

      "Overview": "A hiatal hernia happens when the upper part of the stomach bulges through the large muscle that separates the abdomen and the chest. • The muscle is called the diaphragm. • The diaphragm has a small opening called a hiatus. • The tube used for swallowing food, called the esophagus, passes through the hiatus before connecting to the stomach. • In a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that opening and into the chest. • A small hiatal hernia usually doesn't cause problems. • You may never know you have one unless your healthcare team discovers it when checking for another condition. • But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus. • This can cause heartburn. • Self-care measures or medicines can usually relieve these symptoms. • A very large hiatal hernia might need surgery.",
      "Symptoms": "Most small hiatal hernias cause no symptoms. • But larger hiatal hernias can cause: Heartburn. • Backward flow of swallowed food or liquids into the mouth, called regurgitation. • Backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, called acid reflux. • Trouble swallowing. • Chest or abdominal pain. • Feeling full soon after you eat. • Shortness of breath. • Vomiting of blood or passing of black stools, which could mean bleeding in the digestive tract. • Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any lasting symptoms that worry you. • A hiatal hernia occurs when weakened muscle tissue allows your stomach to bulge up through your diaphragm. • It's not always clear why this happens. • But a hiatal hernia might be caused by: Age-related changes in your diaphragm. • Injury to the area, for example, after trauma or certain types of surgery. • Being born with a very large hiatus. • Constant and intense pressure on the surrounding muscles. • This can happen while coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, exercising or lifting heavy objects. • Hiatal hernias are most common in people who are: Age 50 or older. • Obese.",

      "Overview": "Hiccups are repeated spasms or sudden movements of the diaphragm that you can't control. • The diaphragm is the muscle that separates your chest from your stomach area and plays an important role in breathing. • A spasm in your diaphragm causes your vocal cords to suddenly close, producing a \"hic\" sound. • Eating a large meal, drinking alcoholic or carbonated beverages, or getting excited suddenly may cause hiccups. • In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical issue. • For most people, hiccups usually last only a few minutes. • Rarely, hiccups may continue for months. • When they last that long, they can result in weight loss and extreme tiredness.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms include uncontrolled spasms in your diaphragm and a \"hic\" sound. • Sometimes you may feel a slight tightening sensation in your chest, stomach area or throat. • Make an appointment to see your health care provider if your hiccups last more than 48 hours or if they're so severe that they cause issues with eating, sleeping or breathing. • The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include: Drinking carbonated beverages. • Drinking too much alcohol. • Eating too much. • Being excited or under emotional stress. • Experiencing sudden temperature changes. • Swallowing air, such as when chewing gum or smoking. • Issues that may cause hiccups to last more than 48 hours include nerve damage or irritation, central nervous system disorders, metabolic issues, and certain drug and alcohol problems. • A cause of long-term hiccups is damage to, or irritation of, the vagus nerves or phrenic nerves. • These nerves supply the diaphragm muscle. • Factors that may damage or irritate these nerves include: A hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum. • A tumor, cyst or growth on the thyroid gland in your neck. • Stomach acid that backs up into your esophagus, the muscular tube that delivers food from your mouth to your stomach. • Sore throat or laryngitis. • A tumor or infection in your central nervous system or damage to your central nervous system due to an injury can disrupt your body's normal control of the hiccup reflex. • Examples include: Inflammation of the brain, which also is known as encephalitis. • Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, which also is known as meningitis. • Multiple sclerosis, which is the hardening of tissue in the brain or spinal cord that can result in paralysis or tremors. • Stroke. • Serious brain injury. • Tumors. • Long-term hiccups may result when your body's metabolism doesn't work properly. • Examples of metabolic issues include: Diabetes. • Electrolyte imbalance, which is when your levels of potassium, sodium and other electrolytes are too high or too low. • Kidney disease. • Use of certain drugs or problems with alcohol may cause long-term hiccups. • Examples include: Medicines that cause you to feel relaxed and sleepy, such as sedatives or other drugs used for anesthesia. • A steroid called dexamethasone, which is used to relieve inflammation in conditions such as arthritis, asthma and kidney problems. • Other steroids. • Alcohol use disorder. • Males are much more likely to develop long-term hiccups than females. • Other factors that may increase your risk of hiccups include: Mental or emotional issues. • Anxiety, stress and excitement have been linked with some cases of hiccups. • Surgery. • Some people develop hiccups after general anesthesia or procedures that involve organs in the stomach area. • Ongoing hiccups may interfere with eating, drinking, sleeping and speaking. • Hiccups also can worsen pain.",

      "Overview": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. • The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. • The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring. • Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. • It can persist for many years and worsen over time. • It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. • Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications. • Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. • Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. • This could be attributed to genetic factors.",
      "Symptoms": "Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. • Signs and symptoms of the condition include: Blackheads. • Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs. • Painful pea-sized lumps. • The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. • More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. • Leaking bumps or sores. • Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor. • Tunnels. • Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. • These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus. • Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. • The course of the disease is highly variable. • Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease. • Early diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to effective treatment. • See your dermatologist if your condition: Is painful. • Makes it difficult to move. • Doesn't improve in a few weeks. • Returns within weeks of treatment. • Appears in several locations. • Flares often. • Your dermatologist can create a treatment plan for you. • Hidradenitis suppurativa is not just a boil, and many people with this condition also have related conditions. • People with hidradenitis suppurativa benefit from a health care team with medical and surgical dermatologists at the core. • Other specialists are involved as needed. • Hidradenitis suppurativa develops when hair follicles become blocked, but why this blockage occurs isn't known. • Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight. • An infection or being unclean does not cause hidradenitis suppurativa, and it can't be spread to other people. • Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include: Age. • The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their teens and 20s. • Sex. • Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than males. • Race. • Ethnicity or race might affect risk level. • The condition occurs most in Black people, possibly due to genetic factors. • Family history. • A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited. • Certain conditions. • Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight. • It also has an association with severe acne, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. • Smoking. • Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa. • Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa can cause complications, including: Infection. • Secondary infection is possible in the affected area, but the presence of pus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and doesn't necessarily mean infection. • Scars and skin changes. • The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin. • Restricted movement. • Sores and scar tissue can cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs. • Skin cancer. • Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with long-term hidradenitis suppurativa, particularly in people whose condition involves the perianal area. • This area consists of the tissues around the anus. • Swelling in the arms, legs or genitals. • The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes. • Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which can cause the arms, legs or genitals to swell. • Psychological effects and social isolation. • The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to anxiety or depression. • Lifelong pain. • This pain is much worse than diseases such as psoriasis.",

      "Overview": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. • The body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells. • But high levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of heart disease. • With high cholesterol, fats and other substances can build up in blood vessels called arteries. • This buildup is called plaque. • As more plaque forms over time, the arteries can become narrowed or clogged. • That makes it hard for enough blood to flow through the arteries. • Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot. • The clot may cause a heart attack or stroke. • High cholesterol can be inherited. • That means it can pass from parents to children through genes. • But high cholesterol often is the result of lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, not eating a balanced diet or consuming large amounts of saturated fat. • You can make changes to help prevent it. • And if you have high cholesterol, you can help lower it with a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medicine.",
      "Symptoms": "High cholesterol has no symptoms. • A blood test is the only way to find out if you have it. • The American Heart Association recommends that children get checked, also called screened, for high cholesterol once between ages 9 and 11. • Screening may start earlier if a child has a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack or stroke. • Screening also may start earlier if a child has conditions such as diabetes or obesity. • The next cholesterol screening is recommended for people between ages 17 and 21. • After that, many adults get their cholesterol checked every 4 to 6 years. • People who have health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes may need to get screened more often. • So might those who take cholesterol-lowering medicine. • Those who have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease also may need more-frequent screenings. • If your test results aren't within the desirable range, your healthcare professional might recommend more-frequent testing as well. • Lifestyle factors that may be within your control are the most common cause of high cholesterol. • These factors include eating a diet high in saturated and trans fats and not getting enough exercise. • Sometimes factors that aren't within your control can lead to high cholesterol. • These include gene changes that pass from parents to children, some health conditions, and some medicines. • Conditions that can cause high cholesterol include: Familial hypercholesterolemia. • Chronic kidney disease. • Chronic liver disease. • Diabetes. • HIV/AIDS. • Hypothyroidism. • Lupus. • Overweight and obesity. • Sleep apnea. • Some types of medicines taken for other health conditions also can make cholesterol levels worse. • These include treatments for: Acne. • Cancer. • High blood pressure. • HIV/AIDS. • Irregular heartbeats. • Organ transplants. • Cholesterol travels through the blood, attached to proteins. • This mix of proteins and cholesterol is called a lipoprotein. • There are various types of cholesterol. • The types are based on what the lipoprotein carries. • They are: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. • This is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. • LDL carries cholesterol particles throughout the body. \"Bad\" cholesterol builds up in the walls of arteries. • This makes the arteries hard and narrow. • When a gene change causes high cholesterol, the body has trouble removing LDL cholesterol from the blood. • Or the body has trouble breaking down LDL cholesterol in the liver. • High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. • This is known as the \"good\" cholesterol. • HDL picks up extra cholesterol and takes it back to the liver. • Most often, a blood test to check cholesterol levels also measures a type of fat in the blood that is not a type of cholesterol, called triglycerides. • Having a high triglyceride level also can raise the risk of heart disease. • Lifestyle factors that you may be able to control play a role in triglyceride levels. • Risk factors for high cholesterol levels include: Eating habits. • Eating too much saturated fat or trans fats can lead to high cholesterol. • Saturated fats are found in fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products. • Sometimes trans fats are found in packaged snacks or desserts. • Obesity. • This complex disease involves having too much body fat. • Lack of exercise. • Exercise helps boost the body's \"good\" HDL cholesterol. • Smoking. • Cigarette smoking may lower the level of HDL. • Alcohol. • Drinking lots of alcohol can raise total cholesterol. • Try to limit alcohol to up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Age. • Even young children can have high cholesterol. • But it's much more common in people over 40. • As you age, your liver becomes less able to remove \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. • High cholesterol can lead to other health conditions called complications. • With high cholesterol, a dangerous amount of plaque can build up on the walls of arteries. • This is called atherosclerosis. • Over time, the plaque buildup can cause arteries to narrow and block blood flow. • Less blood flow through the arteries can cause complications such as: Chest pain, also called angina. • If the arteries that supply the heart with blood are affected, that may cause chest pain. • It also may cause other symptoms of a common type of heart disease called coronary artery disease. • Heart attack. • If plaques tear or break, a blood clot can form. • The clot may block the flow of blood at the site where it broke. • Or it may completely break free and block an artery farther away. • If blood flow to part of the heart stops, a heart attack happens. • A heart attack is an emergency that needs treatment right away. • Stroke. • A stroke happens when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. • It's also an emergency that needs treatment right away. • The same heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can lower cholesterol also can help prevent high cholesterol. • You can practice the following habits: Eat a diet that focuses on lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Limit sodium and added sugar. • Also limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you eat. • Instead, eat foods with healthy fats such as fatty or oily fish, nuts, and olive or canola oil. • Lose extra weight and keep it off. • If you smoke, ask your care team to help you quit. • Exercise on most days of the week for at least 30 minutes. • Drink less alcohol, if at all. • Limit alcohol to no more than up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. • Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care

      "Prevention": "The same heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can lower cholesterol also can help prevent high cholesterol. • You can practice the following habits: Eat a diet that focuses on lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. • Limit sodium and added sugar. • Also limit the amount of saturated and trans fats you eat. • Instead, eat foods with healthy fats such as fatty or oily fish, nuts, and olive or canola oil. • Lose extra weight and keep it off. • If you smoke, ask your care team to help you quit. • Exercise on most days of the week for at least 30 minutes. • Drink less alcohol, if at all. • Limit alcohol to no more than up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men."

      "Overview": "Hip dysplasia is the medical term for a hip socket that doesn't fully cover the ball portion of the upper thighbone. • This allows the hip joint to become partially or completely dislocated. • Most people with hip dysplasia are born with the condition. • Healthcare professionals will check your baby for signs of hip dysplasia shortly after birth and during well-baby visits. • If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a soft brace can usually correct the problem. • Mild hip dysplasia might not start causing symptoms until a person is a teenager or young adult. • Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. • It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. • This is called a hip labral tear. • In older children and young adults, surgery may be needed to move the bones into the proper positions for smooth joint movement.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms vary by age group. • In infants, you might notice that one leg is longer than the other. • Once a child begins walking, a limp may develop. • During diaper changes, one hip may be less flexible than the other. • In teenagers and young adults, hip dysplasia can cause painful complications such as osteoarthritis or a hip labral tear. • This may cause activity-related groin pain. • Sometimes, there might be a sensation of instability in the hip.",
      "Causes": "At birth, the hip joint is made of soft cartilage that gradually hardens into bone. • The ball and socket need to fit together well because they act as molds for each other. • If the ball isn't seated firmly into the socket, the socket will not fully form around the ball and will become too shallow. • During the final month before birth, the space within the womb can become so crowded that the ball of the hip joint moves out of its proper position. • This results in a shallower socket. • Factors that may reduce the amount of space in the womb include: First pregnancy. • Large baby. • Breech presentation.",
      "Risk factors": "Hip dysplasia tends to run in families and is more common in girls. • The risk of hip dysplasia is also higher in babies born in the breech position and in babies who are swaddled tightly with the hips and knees straight.",
      "Complications": "Later in life, hip dysplasia can damage the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. • This is called a hip labral tear. • Hip dysplasia can also make the joint more likely to develop osteoarthritis. • This happens because of higher contact pressures over a smaller surface of the socket. • Over time, this wears away the smooth cartilage on the bones that helps them glide against each other as the joint moves."

      "Overview": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. • It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV. • HIV damages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. • If HIV isn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to become AIDS. • Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't get AIDS. • HIV is spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. • This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI. • HIV also is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. • It is also possible for a person with untreated HIV to spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. • There's no cure for HIV/AIDS. • But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. • Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world. • There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS more available in resource-poor countries.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary depending on the person and the phase of infection. • Some people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. • This stage may last a few days to several weeks. • Some people have no symptoms during this stage. • Possible symptoms include: Fever. • Headache. • Muscle aches and joint pain. • Rash. • Sore throat and painful mouth sores. • Swollen lymph glands, also called nodes, mainly on the neck. • Diarrhea. • Weight loss. • Cough. • Night sweats. • These symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them. • However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream, called viral load, is high at this time. • As a result, the infection spreads to others more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. • In this stage of infection, HIV is still in the body and cells of the immune system, called white blood cells. • But during this time, many people don't have symptoms or the infections that HIV can cause. • This stage can last for many years for people who aren't getting antiretroviral therapy, also called ART. • Some people get more-severe disease much sooner. • As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may get mild infections or long-term symptoms such as: Fever. • Fatigue. • Swollen lymph glands, which are often one of the first symptoms of HIV infection. • Diarrhea. • Weight loss. • Oral yeast infection, also called thrush. • Shingles, also called herpes zoster. • Pneumonia. • Better antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. • Thanks to these lifesaving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't get AIDS. • Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. • Having AIDS means your immune system is very damaged. • People with AIDS are more likely to develop diseases they wouldn't get if they had healthy immune systems. • These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. • Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease. • The symptoms of some of these infections may include: Sweats. • Chills. • Fever that keeps coming back. • Ongoing diarrhea. • Swollen lymph glands. • Constant white spots or lesions on the tongue or in the mouth. • Constant fatigue. • Weakness. • Rapid weight loss. • Skin rashes or bumps. • If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can. • HIV is caused by a virus. • It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. • It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. • HIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. • These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. • The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. • You can have an HIV infection with few or no symptoms for years before it turns into AIDS. • AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have a complication you get only if you have AIDS, such as a serious infection or cancer. • You can get infected with HIV if infected blood, semen or fluids from a vagina enter your body. • This can happen when you: Have sex. • You may become infected if you have vaginal or anal sex with an infected partner. • Oral sex carries less risk. • The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that can happen in the rectum or vagina during sex. • Share needles to inject illicit drugs. • Sharing needles and syringes that have been infected puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. • Have a blood transfusion. • Sometimes the virus may be transmitted through blood from a donor. • Hospitals and blood banks screen the blood supply for HIV. • So this risk is small in places where these precautions are taken. • The risk may be higher in resource-poor countries that are not able to screen all donated blood. • Have a pregnancy, give birth or breastfeed. • Pregnant people who have HIV can pass the virus to their babies. • People who are HIV positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can greatly lower the risk to their babies. • You can't become infected with HIV through casual contact. • That means you can't catch HIV or get AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. • HIV isn't spread through air, water or insect bites. • You can't get HIV by donating blood. • Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can have HIV/AIDS. • However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: Have unprotected sex. • Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. • Anal sex is riskier than is vaginal sex. • Your risk of HIV increases if you have more than one sexual partner. • Have an STI. • Many STIs cause open sores on the genitals. • These sores allow HIV to enter the body. • Inject illicit drugs. • If you share needles and syringes, you can be exposed to infected blood. • HIV infection weakens your immune system. • The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers. • Pneumocystis pneumonia, also called PCP. • This fungal infection can cause severe illness. • It doesn't happen as often in the U.S. because of treatments for HIV/AIDS. • But PCP is still the most common cause of pneumonia in people infected with HIV. • Candidiasis, also called thrush. • Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. • It causes a thick, white coating on the mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. • Tuberculosis, also called TB. • TB is a common opportunistic infection linked to HIV. • Worldwide, TB is a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. • It's less common in the U.S. thanks to the wide use of HIV medicines. • Cytomegalovirus. • This common herpes virus is passed in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. • A healthy immune system makes the virus inactive, but it stays in the body. • If the immune system weakens, the virus becomes active, causing damage to the eyes, digestive system, lungs or other organs. • Cryptococcal meningitis. • Meningitis is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord, called meninges. • Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection linked to HIV. • A fungus found in soil causes it. • Toxoplasmosis. • This infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. • Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools. • The parasites then can spread to other animals and humans. • Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease. • Seizures happen when it spreads to the brain. • And it can be fatal. • Lymphoma. • This cancer starts in the white blood cells. • The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes most often in the neck, armpit or groin. • Kaposi sarcoma. • This is a tumor of the blood vessel walls. • Kaposi sarcoma most often appears as pink, red or purple sores called lesions on the skin and in the mouth in people with white skin. • In people with Black or brown skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. • Kaposi sarcoma also can affect the internal organs, including the lungs and organs in the digestive system. • Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers. • These are cancers caused by HPV infection. • They include anal, oral and cervical cancers. • Wasting syndrome. • Untreated HIV/AIDS can cause a great deal of weight loss. • Diarrhea, weakness and fever often happen with the weight loss. • Brain and nervous system, called neurological, complications. • HIV can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. • HIV-associated neurological conditions can range from mild symptoms of behavior changes and reduced mental functioning to severe dementia causing weakness and not being able to function. • Kidney disease. • HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the tiny filters in the kidneys. • These filters remove excess fluid and waste from the blood and pass them to the urine. • Kidney disease most often affects Black and Hispanic people. • Liver disease. • Liver disease also is a major complication, mainly in people who also have hepatitis B or hepatitis C. • There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. • But you can protect yourself and others from infection. • To help prevent the spread of HIV: Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP. • There are two PrEP medicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and one PrEP medicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. • The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). • The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude). • PrEP can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. • PrEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. • Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex. • Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. • Food and Drug Administration-approved PrEP that can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. • A healthcare professional gives the shot. • After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. • The shot is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill. • Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to prevent HIV only to people who don't already have HIV infection. • You need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP. • You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you take PrEP. • You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. • You still need to practice safe sex to protect against other STIs. • If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning PrEP therapy. • Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP. • If you have HIV, taking HIV medicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. • If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. • Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex. • If you use TasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups. • Use post-exposure prophylaxis, also called PEP, if you've been exposed to HIV. • If you think you've been exposed through sex, through needles or in the workplace, contact your healthcare professional or go to an emergency room. • Taking PEP as soon as you can within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of getting HIV. • You need to take the medicine for 28 days. • Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. • Both male and female condoms are available. • If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. • Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. • During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant. • Tell your sexual partners you have HIV. • It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you're HIV positive. • They need to be tested. • Use clean needles. • If you use needles to inject illicit drugs, make sure the needles are sterile. • Don't share them. • Use needle-exchange programs in your community. • Seek help for your drug use. • If you're pregnant, get medical care right away. • You can pass HIV to your baby. • But if you get treatment during pregnancy, you can lessen your baby's risk greatly. • Consider male circumcision. • Studies show that removing the foreskin from the penis, called circumcision, can help reduce the risk of getting HIV infection.",

      "Overview": "Hoarding disorder is an ongoing difficulty throwing away or parting with possessions because you believe that you need to save them. • You may experience distress at the thought of getting rid of the items. • You gradually keep or gather a huge number of items, regardless of their actual value. • Hoarding often creates extremely cramped living conditions with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of clutter. • Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff. • You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose. • For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen. • When there's no more room inside your home, the clutter may spread to the garage, vehicles, yard and other storage areas. • Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. • In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your daily functioning. • People with hoarding disorder may not see it as a problem, so getting them to take part in treatment can be challenging. • But intensive treatment can help you understand how your beliefs and behaviors can be changed so that you can live a safer, more enjoyable life.",
      "Symptoms": "The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. • You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. • As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. • By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. • Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. • You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. • Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. • Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include: Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. • Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. • Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. • Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. • Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. • Problems with planning and organizing. • Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in: Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. • Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. • Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. • Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. • Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. • Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. • Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. • Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter. • With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because: You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. • You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. • You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. • You don't want to waste anything. • Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. • People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. • Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. • Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder. • People who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. • Animals may be confined inside or outside. • Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. • The health and safety of the person and the animals are often at risk because of unsanitary conditions. • If you or a loved one has symptoms of hoarding disorder, talk with a health care provider or a mental health provider with expertise in diagnosing and treating hoarding disorder as soon as possible. • Some communities have agencies that help with hoarding problems. • Check with the local or county government for resources in your area. • As hard as it might be, if your loved one's hoarding disorder threatens health or safety, you may need to contact local authorities, such as police, fire, public health, child or elder protective services, or animal welfare agencies.",
      "Causes": "It's not clear what causes hoarding disorder. • Genetics, brain function and stressful life events are being studied as possible causes.",
      "Risk factors": "Hoarding usually starts around ages 15 to 19. • It tends to get worse with age. • Hoarding is more common in older adults than in younger adults. • Risk factors include: Personality. • Many people who have hoarding disorder have a behavior style that includes trouble making decisions and problems with attention, organization and problem-solving. • Family history. • There is a strong association between having a family member who has hoarding disorder and having the disorder yourself. • Stressful life events. • Some people develop hoarding disorder after experiencing a stressful life event that they had difficulty coping with, such as the death of a loved one, divorce or losing possessions in a fire.",
      "Complications": "Hoarding disorder can cause a variety of complications, including: Increased risk of falls. • Injury or being trapped by shifting or falling items. • Family conflicts. • Loneliness and social isolation. • Conditions that aren't clean and can be a health risk. • A fire hazard. • Poor work performance. • Legal issues, such as eviction. • Hoarding disorder also is linked with other mental health conditions, such as: Depression. • Anxiety disorders. • Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). • Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",
      "Prevention": "Because little is understood about what causes hoarding disorder, there's no known way to prevent it. • However, as with many mental health conditions, getting treatment at the first sign of a problem may help prevent hoarding from getting worse. • This is especially important because by the time clutter becomes a noticeable problem, hoarding likely has been going on for a while."

      "Overview": "Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. • The lymphatic system is part of the body's germ-fighting and disease-fighting immune system. • Hodgkin lymphoma begins when healthy cells in the lymphatic system change and grow out of control. • The lymphatic system includes lymph nodes. • They are found throughout the body. • Most lymph nodes are in the abdomen, groin, pelvis, chest, underarms and neck. • The lymphatic system also includes the spleen, thymus, tonsils and bone marrow. • Hodgkin lymphoma can affect all these areas and other organs in the body. • Hodgkin lymphoma, which used to be called Hodgkin disease, is one of two broad types of lymphoma. • The other is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. • Advances in diagnosis and treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have helped give people with this disease the chance for a full recovery.",
      "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma may include: Painless swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin. • Fever. • Feeling very tired. • Night sweats. • Weight loss that happens without trying. • Itchy skin. • Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. • Hodgkin lymphoma symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. • The healthcare professional may check for those causes first. • Healthcare professionals aren't sure what causes Hodgkin lymphoma. • It begins with changes in the DNA of a disease-fighting blood cell called a lymphocyte. • A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. • The DNA changes tell the cells to multiply quickly and live when other cells would naturally die. • The Hodgkin lymphoma cells attract many healthy immune system cells to protect them and help them grow. • The extra cells crowd into the lymph nodes and cause swelling and other symptoms. • There are multiple types of Hodgkin lymphoma. • The type of lymphoma you have is based on the characteristics of the cells involved in your disease and their behavior. • The type of lymphoma you have helps determine your treatment options. • Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is the more common type of this disease. • People diagnosed with this type have large lymphoma cells called Reed-Sternberg cells in their lymph nodes. • Subtypes of classical Hodgkin lymphoma include: Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. • Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma. • Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma. • Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma. • This type of Hodgkin lymphoma is much rarer. • It involves lymphoma cells sometimes called popcorn cells because of how they look. • Usually, it is diagnosed early and may need less intensive treatments than the classical type of Hodgkin lymphoma. • Factors that can increase the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma include: Your age. • Hodgkin lymphoma is most often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s and those over age 65. • A family history of Hodgkin lymphoma. • Having a blood relative with Hodgkin lymphoma increases the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. • Being male. • People who are assigned male at birth are slightly more likely to develop Hodgkin lymphoma than are those who are assigned female at birth. • Past Epstein-Barr infection. • People who have had illnesses caused by the Epstein-Barr virus are at higher risk of Hodgkin lymphoma than are those who haven't. • One example is infectious mononucleosis. • HIV infection. • People who are infected with HIV have an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. • There's no way to prevent Hodgkin lymphoma.",

      "Overview": "Huntington's disease causes nerve cells in the brain to decay over time. • The disease affects a person's movements, thinking ability and mental health. • Huntington's disease is rare. • It's often passed down through a changed gene from a parent. • Huntington's disease symptoms can develop at any time, but they often begin when people are in their 30s or 40s. • If the disease develops before age 20, it's called juvenile Huntington's disease. • When Huntington's develops early, symptoms can be different and the disease may have a faster progression. • Medicines are available to help manage the symptoms of Huntington's disease. • However, treatments can't prevent the physical, mental and behavioral decline caused by the disease.",
      "Symptoms": "Huntington's disease usually causes movement disorders. • It also causes mental health conditions and trouble with thinking and planning. • These conditions can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. • The first symptoms vary greatly from person to person. • Some symptoms appear to be worse or have a greater effect on functional ability. • These symptoms may change in severity throughout the course of the disease. • The movement disorders related to Huntington's disease may cause movements that can't be controlled, called chorea. • Chorea are involuntary movements affecting all the muscles of the body, specifically the arms and legs, the face and the tongue. • They also can affect the ability to make voluntary movements. • Symptoms may include: Involuntary jerking or writhing movements. • Muscle rigidity or muscle contracture. • Slow or unusual eye movements. • Trouble walking or keeping posture and balance. • Trouble with speech or swallowing. • People with Huntington's disease also may not be able to control voluntary movements. • This can have a greater impact than the involuntary movements caused by the disease. • Having trouble with voluntary movements can affect a person's ability to work, perform daily activities, communicate and remain independent. • Huntington's disease often causes trouble with cognitive skills. • These symptoms may include: Trouble organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks. • Lack of flexibility or getting stuck on a thought, behavior or action, known as perseveration. • Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity. • Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities. • Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words. • Trouble learning new information. • The most common mental health condition associated with Huntington's disease is depression. • This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. • Instead, depression appears to occur because of damage to the brain and changes in brain function. • Symptoms may include: Irritability, sadness or apathy. • Social withdrawal. • Trouble sleeping. • Fatigue and loss of energy. • Thoughts of death, dying or suicide. • Other common mental health conditions include: Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by intrusive thoughts that keep coming back and by behaviors repeated over and over. • Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem. • Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania. • Weight loss also is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease gets worse. • In younger people, Huntington's disease begins and progresses slightly differently than it does in adults. • Symptoms that may appear early in the course of the disease include: Trouble paying attention. • Sudden drop in overall school performance. • Behavioral issues, such as being aggressive or disruptive. • Contracted and rigid muscles that affect walking, especially in young children. • Slight movements that can't be controlled, known as tremors. • Frequent falls or clumsiness. • Seizures. • See your healthcare professional if you notice changes in your movements, emotional state or mental ability. • The symptoms of Huntington's disease also can be caused by a number of different conditions. • Therefore, it's important to get a prompt and thorough diagnosis. • Huntington's disease is caused by a difference in a single gene that's passed down from a parent. • Huntington's disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. • This means that a person needs only one copy of the nontypical gene to develop the disorder. • With the exception of genes on the sex chromosomes, a person inherits two copies of every gene — one copy from each parent. • A parent with a nontypical gene could pass along the nontypical copy of the gene or the healthy copy. • Each child in the family, therefore, has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene that causes the genetic condition. • People who have a parent with Huntington's disease are at risk of having the disease themselves. • Children of a parent with Huntington's have a 50 percent chance of having the gene change that causes Huntington's. • After Huntington's disease starts, a person's ability to function gradually gets worse over time. • How quickly the disease gets worse and how long it takes varies. • The time from the first symptoms to death is often about 10 to 30 years. • Juvenile Huntington's disease usually results in death within 10 to 15 years after symptoms develop. • The depression linked with Huntington's disease may increase the risk of suicide. • Some research suggests that risk of suicide is greater before a diagnosis and also when a person loses independence. • Eventually, a person with Huntington's disease requires help with all activities of daily living and care. • Late in the disease, the person will likely be confined to a bed and unable to speak. • Someone with Huntington's disease is generally able to understand language and has an awareness of family and friends, though some won't recognize family members. • Common causes of death include: Pneumonia or other infections. • Injuries related to falls. • Complications related to trouble swallowing. • People with a known family history of Huntington's disease may be concerned about whether they may pass the Huntington gene on to their children. • They might consider genetic testing and family planning options. • If an at-risk parent is considering genetic testing, it can be helpful to meet with a genetic counselor. • A genetic counselor explains the potential risks of a positive test result, which may mean that the parent may develop the disease. • Also, couples may need to make additional choices about whether to have children or to consider alternatives. • They may decide to choose prenatal testing for the gene or in vitro fertilization with donor sperm or eggs. • Another option for couples is in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. • In this process, eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilized with the father's sperm in a laboratory. • The embryos are tested for the presence of the Huntington gene. • Only those testing negative for the Huntington gene are implanted in the mother's uterus.",

      "Overview": "A hydrocele (HI-droe-seel) is a type of swelling in the scrotum, the pouch of skin that holds the testicles. • This swelling happens when fluid collects in the thin sac that surrounds a testicle. • Hydroceles are common in newborns. • They often go away without treatment by age 1. • Older children and adults can get a hydrocele due to an injury within the scrotum or other health problems. • A hydrocele often isn't painful or harmful. • It might not need any treatment. • But it's important to see a health care provider if the scrotum looks swollen.",
      "Symptoms": "Often the only sign of a hydrocele is a painless swelling of one or both testicles. • The swelling might make an adult's scrotum feel heavy. • In general, pain gets worse as the swelling increases. • Sometimes, the swollen area might be smaller in the morning and larger later in the day. • See your health care provider if you or your child has swelling of the scrotum. • It's important to find out if there are other causes of the swelling that could be treated. • For example, a hydrocele might be linked with a weak point in the ab muscles that allows part of the intestine to extend into the scrotum. • This problem is called inguinal hernia. • A baby's hydrocele often goes away on its own. • But if your baby still has a hydrocele after a year or if the swelling gets worse, ask your child's health care provider to check the hydrocele again. • Get help right away if you or your child has sudden, terrible pain or swelling in the scrotum. • It's extra important to get prompt treatment if the pain or swelling starts within a few hours of an injury to the scrotum. • These symptoms can happen with certain health problems, including blocked blood flow in a twisted testicle. • This problem is called testicular torsion. • It needs to be treated within hours of the symptoms starting to save the testicle. • A hydrocele can form before birth. • Typically, the testicles descend from the developing baby's stomach area into the scrotum. • A sac comes with each testicle, letting fluid surround the testicles. • Most often, each sac closes and the fluid is absorbed. • Sometimes, the fluid stays after the sac closes. • This is called a noncommunicating hydrocele. • The fluid usually is absorbed by age 1 or 2. • Other times, the sac stays open. • This is called a communicating hydrocele. • The sac can change size, or fluid can flow back into the stomach area. • Communicating hydroceles are often linked with inguinal hernia. • A hydrocele can form due to an injury. • Or it can form because of a type of swelling, called inflammation, within the scrotum. • Inflammation might be caused by an infection in the testicle or in the small, coiled tube at the back of each testicle. • Most hydroceles are present at birth. • At least 5% of newborn males have a hydrocele. • Premature babies, who are born more than three weeks before their due dates, have a higher risk of having a hydrocele. • Risk factors for getting a hydrocele later in life include: Injury or inflammation within the scrotum. • Infection, including a sexually transmitted infection. • A hydrocele often isn't dangerous and usually doesn't affect the ability to have a baby. • But a hydrocele might be linked with a health problem that can cause serious issues. • These problems include: Infection or tumor. • Either might cause the testicles to make less sperm or not work as well as usual. • Inguinal hernia. • This can lead to life-threatening health problems.",

      "Overview": "Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain. • The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain. • Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. • But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function. • Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. • Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. • Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age. • Common symptoms of hydrocephalus in infants include: A head that is larger than usual. • A rapid increase in the size of an infant's head. • A bulge or tense soft spot on the top of the head. • Nausea and vomiting. • Sleepiness or sluggishness, known as lethargy. • Irritability. • Poor eating. • Seizures. • Eyes fixed downward, known as sunsetting of the eyes. • Problems with muscle tone and strength. • Among toddlers and older children, symptoms might include: Headache. • Blurred or double vision. • Eye movements that are not usual. • Enlargement of a toddler's head. • Sleepiness or sluggishness. • Nausea or vomiting. • Trouble with balance. • Poor coordination. • Poor appetite. • Loss of bladder control or urinating often. • Irritability. • Change in personality. • Decline in school performance. • Delays or problems with earlier gained skills, such as walking or talking. • Common symptoms in this age group include: Headache. • Sluggishness. • Loss of coordination or balance. • Loss of bladder control or needing to urinate often. • Vision problems. • Decline in memory, concentration and other thinking skills that may affect job performance. • Among adults 60 and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are: Loss of bladder control or needing to urinate often. • Memory loss. • Progressive loss of other thinking or reasoning skills. • Trouble walking, often described as shuffling or the feeling of the feet being stuck. • Poor coordination or balance. • Seek emergency medical care for infants and toddlers with these symptoms: A high-pitched cry. • Problems with sucking or feeding. • Recurrent vomiting with no clear cause. • Seizures. • Seek prompt medical attention for other hydrocephalus symptoms in any age group. • More than one condition can cause the problems associated with hydrocephalus. • It's important to get a timely diagnosis and appropriate care. • Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream. • Tissues lining the ventricles of the brain produce cerebrospinal fluid. • It flows through the ventricles by way of channels. • The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column. • It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues on the surface of the brain. • Cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in brain function by: Allowing the relatively heavy brain to float within the skull. • Cushioning the brain to prevent injury. • Removing waste products of the brain's metabolism. • Flowing back and forth between the brain cavity and spinal column. • This flow maintains a constant pressure within the brain and allows for changes in blood pressure in the brain. • Too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles can occur for one of the following reasons: Obstruction. • Partial blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is the most common cause of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles. • A blockage may happen from one ventricle to another or from the ventricles to other spaces around the brain. • Poor absorption. • Less common is a problem with absorbing cerebrospinal fluid. • This is often related to inflammation of brain tissues from disease or injury. • Overproduction. • Rarely, cerebrospinal fluid is created more quickly than it can be absorbed. • Much of the time, the cause of hydrocephalus is not known. • However, developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus. • Hydrocephalus may be present at or before birth, known as congenital hydrocephalus. • Or it can occur shortly after birth. • Any of the following incidents may cause hydrocephalus in newborns: The central nervous system developed in a way that blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. • Bleeding occurred within the ventricles. • This is a possible complication of premature birth. • There was an infection in the uterus during pregnancy, such as rubella or syphilis. • An infection can cause swelling in the brain tissues of an unborn baby. • Other factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include: Tumors of the brain or spinal cord. • Central nervous system infections, such as bacterial meningitis or mumps. • Bleeding in the brain from a stroke or head injury. • Other traumatic injury to the brain. • In most cases, hydrocephalus worsens. • Without treatment, hydrocephalus leads to complications. • Complications may include learning disabilities or developmental and physical disabilities. • Complications of this condition also can result in death. • When hydrocephalus is mild and it's treated, there may be few, if any, serious complications.",

      "Complications": "In most cases, hydrocephalus worsens. • Without treatment, hydrocephalus leads to complications. • Complications may include learning disabilities or developmental and physical disabilities. • Complications of this condition also can result in death. • When hydrocephalus is mild and it's treated, there may be few, if any, serious complications."

      "Overview": "Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys. • It happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. • The condition can be due to a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys. • It also can happen due to a difference present at birth that prevents urine from draining properly. • In some people, hydronephrosis causes kidney damage over time. • Hydronephrosis can happen at any age. • The condition often causes no symptoms. • People who get symptoms may have side and back pain, painful urination, vomiting and fever. • Healthcare professionals have various ways to spot hydronephrosis. • Tests to find the condition can be done during infancy or sometimes before a baby is born. • Treatment for hydronephrosis depends on the condition's cause. • Some people need medicine or surgery to feel better and prevent kidney damage. • Mild hydronephrosis sometimes goes away on its own over time.",
      "Symptoms": "Hydronephrosis often causes no symptoms. • But when symptoms happen, they can include: Pain in the side and back that may travel to the lower stomach area or groin. • Pain with urination, or feeling a need to urinate that is urgent or happens often. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Fever. • Failure to thrive in infants. • Weight loss or loss of appetite. • Blood in urine. • Call your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of hydronephrosis. • Babies with the condition often don't have symptoms. • But get your baby a healthcare checkup right away for symptoms such as high fever.",
      "Causes": "Causes of hydronephrosis include a blockage or other health issue that affects the urinary tract. • The urinary tract includes the kidneys and the bladder. • Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. • Urine leaves the bladder and the body through another tube called the urethra. • A partly or fully blocked urinary tract can keep urine from leaving the kidneys and cause swelling. • Other issues that disrupt the urinary tract can cause urine to flow backward through the ureters from the bladder up into the kidneys. • When urine flows the wrong way, the condition is called vesicoureteral reflux. • Causes of hydronephrosis include the following: Conditions present at birth. • Some babies are born with a partial kidney blockage called a ureteropelvic junction obstruction. • Most often, the blockage forms where a kidney attaches to one of the tubes that carry urine to the bladder. • These tubes are called the ureters. • Other babies are born with a ureter that isn't typical in structure. • Urine flows backward through the ureter from the bladder up into the kidney as a result. • When backward urine flow happens, it's known as vesicoureteral reflux. • Kidney stones. • These are hard buildups of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. • Enlarged prostate. • A very enlarged prostate can cause the bladder to have trouble emptying urine. • Urine may back up into the kidneys as a result. • Injured or narrowed ureter. • Pelvic surgery done with cuts through the stomach area could injure a ureter by accident. • A ureter could become narrowed for reasons such as scarring after surgery or having radiation therapy for prostate cancer. • Urinary tract infection. • This type of infection can inflame any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys. • Pregnancy. • Swelling of the kidneys' urine drainage system is common during pregnancy. • Often, hydronephrosis in pregnant people doesn't cause symptoms and goes away after giving birth. • Cancer. • With some types of cancer, a tumor can cause a urinary tract blockage. • These include cancers of the bladder, cervix, colon and prostate.",
      "Risk factors": "Hydronephrosis risk factors among adults ages 20 to 60 include being born female. • The higher risk could be due to certain conditions that affect the uterus, such as pregnancy. • It also could be due to conditions that affect the ovaries, such as cysts, buildups of pus and cancer. • Risk factors for people older than age 60 include having an enlarged prostate or a urinary tract blockage from cancer.",
      "Complications": "Hydronephrosis can lead to other health conditions called complications. • Without treatment, some people who have severe hydronephrosis develop lasting kidney damage. • Rarely, the condition can cause an affected kidney to lose its ability to filter blood, also called kidney failure."

      "Overview": "Hypercalcemia is a condition in which the calcium level in the blood becomes too high. • Too much calcium in the blood can weaken bones and create kidney stones. • It also can affect the heart and brain. • Most often, hypercalcemia happens after one or more of the parathyroid glands make too much hormone. • These four tiny glands are in the neck, near the thyroid gland. • Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical conditions and some medicines. • Taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements also can cause hypercalcemia. • Some people have no symptoms of this condition. • Others have symptoms that range from mild to serious. • Treatment depends on the cause.",
      "Symptoms": "You might not have any symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild. • If it's more serious, your symptoms are related to the parts of your body affected by high blood calcium levels. • Examples include: Kidneys. • Excess calcium makes the kidneys work harder to filter it. • This can cause serious thirst and frequent urination. • Digestive system. • Hypercalcemia can cause stomach upset or pain, vomiting, and constipation. • Bones and muscles. • Most often, the extra calcium in the blood is leached from the bones. • This weakens the bones. • It can cause bone pain and muscle weakness. • Brain. • Hypercalcemia can affect how the brain works. • That can lead to trouble focusing, confusion, drowsiness and fatigue. • It also can cause depression. • Heart. • Rarely, serious hypercalcemia can affect the heart. • It can cause feelings of a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. • It also can cause the heart to beat out of rhythm. • It's linked with other heart-related conditions as well. • Call your healthcare professional if you think you have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. • These can include extreme thirst, frequent urination and pain in the stomach area. • Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. • It also helps muscles contract and nerves send signals. • When the parathyroid glands work right, they release hormones that help maintain the right balance of calcium in the blood. • Parathyroid hormones trigger: Bones to release calcium into the blood. • The digestive tract to absorb more calcium. • The kidneys to release less calcium and activate more vitamin D. • Vitamin D plays a key role in the body's ability to absorb calcium. • This delicate balance between too little calcium in the blood and hypercalcemia can be affected by various factors. • Hypercalcemia can be caused by: Overactive parathyroid glands. • This also is called hyperparathyroidism. • It's the most common cause of hypercalcemia. • Overactive parathyroid glands make too much parathyroid hormone. • The condition can stem from a small tumor that isn't cancer. • It also can stem from one or more of the four parathyroid glands becoming larger. • Cancer. • Lung cancer, breast cancer and some blood cancers can raise the risk of hypercalcemia. • Cancer that spreads to the bones also raises the risk. • Other diseases. • Conditions such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis can raise blood levels of vitamin D. • That in turn spurs the digestive tract to absorb more calcium. • Genetic factors. • A rare genetic condition called familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia causes an increase of calcium in the blood. • This condition doesn't cause symptoms or complications of hypercalcemia. • Little or no movement. • People who have a condition that causes them to spend a lot of time sitting or lying down can get hypercalcemia. • Over time, bones that don't bear weight release calcium into the blood. • Serious dehydration. • This is a common cause of mild or short-term hypercalcemia. • Having less fluid in the blood causes a rise in calcium. • Some medicines. • Medicines such as lithium and thiazide diuretics might cause more parathyroid hormone to be released. • Supplements. • Taking too much calcium or vitamin D supplements over time can raise calcium levels in the blood. • Hypercalcemia can lead to medical conditions that include: Osteoporosis. • This condition involves thinning bones. • It could develop if the bones keep releasing calcium into the blood. • Osteoporosis can lead to broken bones, curving of the spinal column and loss of height. • Kidney stones. • If the urine contains too much calcium, crystals might form in the kidneys. • Over time, the crystals can combine to form kidney stones. • Passing a stone can be very painful. • Kidney failure. • This condition limits the kidneys' ability to clean the blood and get rid of extra fluid. • It can develop over time as hypercalcemia damages the kidneys. • Nervous system conditions. • Serious hypercalcemia can lead to confusion, dementia and coma. • Coma can be fatal. • Irregular heart rhythm. • This also is called arrhythmia. • Hypercalcemia can affect the electrical signals that control the heartbeat. • That can cause the heart to beat out of rhythm.",

      "Symptoms": "Often, the first sign of hyperoxaluria is a kidney stone. • Kidney stone symptoms can include: Sharp pain in the back, side, lower stomach area or groin. • Urine that looks pink, red or brown due to blood. • Frequent urge to pee, also called urination. • Pain when peeing. • Not being able to urinate or peeing only a small amount. • Chills, fever, upset stomach or vomiting. • It's not common for children to get kidney stones. • Kidney stones that form in children and teenagers are likely to be caused by a health problem, such as hyperoxaluria. • All young people with kidney stones should have a checkup. • The checkup should include a test that measures oxalate in the urine. • Adults who keep getting kidney stones also should be tested for oxalate in the urine.",
      "Causes": "Hyperoxaluria happens when too much of a chemical called oxalate builds up in the urine. • There are different types of hyperoxaluria: Primary hyperoxaluria. • This type is a rare inherited disease, which means that it's passed down in families. • It's caused by changes in a gene. • With primary hyperoxaluria, the liver doesn't make enough of a certain protein that prevents too much oxalate from being made. • Or the protein doesn't work as it should. • The body gets rid of excess oxalate through the kidneys, in urine. • The extra oxalate can combine with calcium to form kidney stones and crystals. • These can damage the kidneys and cause them to stop working. • With primary hyperoxaluria, kidney stones form early. • They most often cause symptoms from childhood through age 20. • The kidneys of many people with primary hyperoxaluria stop working well by early to middle adulthood. • But kidney failure can happen even in babies with this disease. • Others with primary hyperoxaluria may never have kidney failure. • Enteric hyperoxaluria. • Some intestine problems cause the body to absorb more oxalate from foods. • This can then increase the amount of oxalate in the urine. • Crohn's disease is one intestine problem that can lead to enteric hyperoxaluria. • Another is short bowel syndrome, which can happen when parts of the small intestine are removed during surgery. • Other health problems make it hard for the small intestine to absorb fats from food. • If this happens, it might leave oxalate more available for the gut to absorb. • Usually, oxalate combines with calcium in the gut and exits the body through stools. • But when there is increased fat in the gut, calcium binds to the fat instead. • This allows oxalate to be free in the gut and absorbed in the bloodstream. • It's then filtered by the kidneys. • Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery also can lead to trouble absorbing fat in the gut, which raises the risk of hyperoxaluria. • Hyperoxaluria tied to eating foods with lots of oxalate. • Eating large amounts of foods high in oxalate can raise your risk of hyperoxaluria or kidney stones. • These foods include nuts, chocolate, brewed tea, spinach, potatoes, beets and rhubarb. • It's important to stay away from high-oxalate foods if you have diet-related or enteric hyperoxaluria. • Your doctor also may tell you to limit these foods if you have primary hyperoxaluria.",
      "Complications": "Without treatment, primary hyperoxaluria can damage the kidneys. • Over time the kidneys may stop working. • This is called kidney failure. • For some people, this is the first sign of the disease. • Symptoms of kidney failure include: Peeing less than usual or not peeing at all. • Feeling ill and tired. • Not feeling hungry. • Upset stomach and vomiting. • Pale, ashen skin or other changes to skin color tied to having a low number of red blood cells, also called anemia. • Swelling of hands and feet. • Oxalosis happens if you have primary or enteric hyperoxaluria and your kidneys stop working well enough. • The body can no longer get rid of the extra oxalate, so the oxalate starts building up. • First it builds up in the blood, then in the eyes, bones, skin, muscles, blood vessels, heart and other organs. • Oxalosis can cause many health problems outside the kidneys in its late stages. • These include: Bone disease. • Anemia. • Skin ulcers. • Heart and eye problems. • In children, serious problems developing and growing."

      "Overview": "Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. • This condition also is called overactive thyroid. • Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. • That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat. • Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. • Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. • Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. • In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.",
      "Symptoms": "Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. • That can make it hard to diagnose. • It can cause many symptoms, including: Losing weight without trying. • Fast heartbeat, a condition called tachycardia. • Irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmia. • Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations. • Increased hunger. • Nervousness, anxiety and irritability. • Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers. • Sweating. • Changes in menstrual cycles. • Increased sensitivity to heat. • Changes in bowel patterns, especially more-frequent bowel movements. • Enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes called a goiter, which may appear as a swelling at the base of the neck. • Tiredness. • Muscle weakness. • Sleep problems. • Warm, moist skin. • Thinning skin. • Fine, brittle hair. • Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice. • These symptoms may include an irregular heartbeat, weight loss, depression, and feeling weak or tired during ordinary activities. • If you lose weight without trying, or if you notice a rapid heartbeat, unusual sweating, swelling at the base of your neck or other symptoms of hyperthyroidism, make an appointment with your health care provider. • Tell your provider about all the symptoms you've noticed even if they are minor. • After a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, most people need regular follow-up visits with their health care provider to monitor the condition. • Hyperthyroidism can be caused by several medical conditions that affect the thyroid gland. • The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck. • It has a big impact on the body. • Every part of metabolism is controlled by hormones that the thyroid gland makes. • The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). • These hormones affect every cell in the body. • They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. • They help control body temperature. • They have an effect on heart rate. • And they help control how much protein the body makes. • Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland puts too much of those thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. • Conditions that can lead to hyperthyroidism include: Graves' disease. • Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack the thyroid gland. • That prompts the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. • Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. • Overactive thyroid nodules. • This condition also is called toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter and Plummer disease. • This form of hyperthyroidism happens when a thyroid adenoma makes too much thyroid hormone. • An adenoma is a part of the gland that is walled off from the rest of the gland. • It forms noncancerous lumps that can make the thyroid bigger than usual. • Thyroiditis. • This condition happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. • In some cases, it's due to an autoimmune disorder. • In others, the reason for it is unclear. • The inflammation can cause extra thyroid hormone stored in the thyroid gland to leak into the bloodstream and cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism. • Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include: A family history of thyroid disease, particularly Graves' disease. • A personal history of certain chronic illnesses, including pernicious anemia and primary adrenal insufficiency. • A recent pregnancy, which raises the risk of developing thyroiditis. • This can lead to hyperthyroidism. • Hyperthyroidism can lead to the following complications. • Some of the most serious complications of hyperthyroidism involve the heart, including: A heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke. • Congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't circulate enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to weak, brittle bones. • This condition is called osteoporosis. • The strength of bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals in them. • Too much thyroid hormone makes it hard for the body to get calcium into bones. • Some people with hyperthyroidism develop a problem called thyroid eye disease. • It's more common in people who smoke. • This disorder affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes. • Symptoms of thyroid eye disease include: Bulging eyes. • Gritty sensation in the eyes. • Pressure or pain in the eyes. • Puffy or retracted eyelids. • Reddened or inflamed eyes. • Light sensitivity. • Double vision. • Eye problems that go untreated may cause vision loss. • In rare cases, people with Graves' disease develop Graves' dermopathy. • This causes the skin to change colors and swell, often on the shins and feet. • This rare condition also is called thyroid storm. • Hyperthyroidism raises the risk of thyrotoxic crisis. • It causes severe, sometimes life-threatening symptoms. • It requires emergency medical care. • Symptoms may include: Fever. • Fast heartbeat. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Diarrhea. • Dehydration. • Confusion. • Delirium.",

      "Complications": "Hyperthyroidism can lead to the following complications. • Some of the most serious complications of hyperthyroidism involve the heart, including: A heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke. • Congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't circulate enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to weak, brittle bones. • This condition is called osteoporosis. • The strength of bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals in them. • Too much thyroid hormone makes it hard for the body to get calcium into bones. • Some people with hyperthyroidism develop a problem called thyroid eye disease. • It's more common in people who smoke. • This disorder affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes. • Symptoms of thyroid eye disease include: Bulging eyes. • Gritty sensation in the eyes. • Pressure or pain in the eyes. • Puffy or retracted eyelids. • Reddened or inflamed eyes. • Light sensitivity. • Double vision. • Eye problems that go untreated may cause vision loss. • In rare cases, people with Graves' disease develop Graves' dermopathy. • This causes the skin to change colors and swell, often on the shins and feet. • This rare condition also is called thyroid storm. • Hyperthyroidism raises the risk of thyrotoxic crisis. • It causes severe, sometimes life-threatening symptoms. • It requires emergency medical care. • Symptoms may include: Fever. • Fast heartbeat. • Nausea. • Vomiting. • Diarrhea. • Dehydration. • Confusion. • Delirium."

      "Overview": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, also called hypertrophied. • The thickened heart muscle can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. • Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it. • That's because they have few, if any, symptoms. • But in a small number of people with HCM, the thickened heart muscle can cause serious symptoms. • These include shortness of breath and chest pain. • Some people with HCM have changes in the heart's electrical system. • These changes can result in life-threatening irregular heartbeats or sudden death.",
      "Symptoms": "Symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include one or more of the following: Chest pain, especially during exercise. • Fainting, especially during or just after exercise or other physical activity. • Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats called palpitations. • Shortness of breath, especially during exercise. • Many conditions can cause shortness of breath and fast, pounding heartbeats. • It's important to get a prompt checkup to find the cause and receive the right care. • See your healthcare professional if you have a family history of HCM or any symptoms related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have any of the following symptoms for more than a few minutes: Rapid or irregular heartbeat. • Trouble breathing. • Chest pain.",
      "Causes": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is caused by changes in genes that cause the heart muscle to thicken. • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically affects the wall between the two bottom chambers of the heart. • This wall is called the septum. • The chambers are called the ventricles. • The thickened wall might block blood flow out of the heart. • This is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • If there's no significant blocking of blood flow, the condition is called nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • But the heart's main pumping chamber, called the left ventricle, might stiffen. • This makes it hard for the heart to relax. • The stiffness also lessens the amount of blood the ventricle can hold and send to the body with each heartbeat. • Heart muscle cells also become arranged differently in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. • This is called myofiber disarray. • It can trigger irregular heartbeats in some people.",
      "Risk factors": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is passed down through families. • That means it's inherited. • People with one parent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 50% chance of having the gene change that causes the disease. • Parents, children, or brothers or sisters of a person with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should ask their healthcare team about screening tests for the disease.",
      "Complications": "Complications of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can include: Atrial fibrillation (AFib). • A thickened heart muscle and changes in the structure of heart cells can trigger an irregular and often very rapid heartbeat called AFib. • AFib also raises the risk of blood clots, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. • Blocked blood flow. • In many people, the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart. • This can cause shortness of breath with activity, chest pain, dizziness and fainting spells. • Mitral valve disease. • If the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart, the valve between the left heart chambers might not close properly. • That valve is called the mitral valve. • If it doesn't close properly, blood can leak backward into the left upper chamber. • This is a condition called mitral valve regurgitation. • It might make hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptoms worse. • Dilated cardiomyopathy. • In a small number of people with HCM, the thickened heart muscle becomes weak and doesn't work well. • The condition tends to start in the left lower heart chamber. • The chamber becomes larger. • The heart pumps with less force. • Heart failure. • Over time, the thickened heart muscle can become too stiff to fill the heart with blood. • As a result, the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. • Fainting, also called syncope. • An irregular heartbeat or blockage of blood flow can sometimes cause fainting. • Unexplained fainting can be related to sudden cardiac death, especially if it's happened recently and in a young person. • Sudden cardiac death. • Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause heart-related sudden death in people of all ages. • Many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it. • As a result, sudden cardiac death might be the first sign of the condition. • It can happen in young people who seem healthy, including high school athletes and other young, active adults.",
      "Prevention": "There is no known way to prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). • It's important to find the condition with tests as early as possible to guide treatment and prevent complications. • Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is passed down in families. • If you have a parent, brother, sister or child with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ask your healthcare team if genetic screening is right for you. • But not everyone with HCM has a gene change that tests can detect. • Also, some insurance companies may not cover genetic testing. • If genetic testing isn't done, or if the results aren't helpful, screening may be done with repeated echocardiograms. • Echocardiograms use sound waves to make pictures of the heart. • For people who have a family member with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Echocardiogram screenings are recommended starting at about age 12. • Screening with echocardiograms should continue every 1 to 3 years through ages 18 to 21. • After that, the screenings can be done every five years through adulthood. • You may need to have an echocardiogram more often based on your overall health and healthcare team's preference."

      "Overview": "Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. • Glucose is your body's main energy source. • Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. • But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes. • Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. • For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. • But your numbers might be different. • Ask your health care provider. • Treatment involves quickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. • Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia.",
      "Symptoms": "If blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include: Looking pale Shakiness Sweating Headache Hunger or nausea An irregular or fast heartbeat Fatigue Irritability or anxiety Difficulty concentrating Dizziness or lightheadedness Tingling or numbness of the lips, tongue or cheek As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms can include: Confusion, unusual behavior or both, such as the inability to complete routine tasks Loss of coordination Slurred speech Blurry vision or tunnel vision Nightmares, if asleep Severe hypoglycemia may cause: Unresponsiveness (loss of consciousness) Seizures Seek medical help immediately if: You have what might be hypoglycemia symptoms and you don't have diabetes You have diabetes and hypoglycemia isn't responding to treatment, such as drinking juice or regular (not diet) soft drinks, eating candy, or taking glucose tablets Seek emergency help for someone with diabetes or a history of hypoglycemia who has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness. • Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low for bodily functions to continue. • There are several reasons why this can happen. • The most common reason for low blood sugar is a side effect of medications used to treat diabetes. • When you eat, your body breaks down foods into glucose. • Glucose, the main energy source for your body, enters the cells with the help of insulin — a hormone produced by your pancreas. • Insulin allows the glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need. • Extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. • When you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, you will stop producing insulin. • Another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose into your bloodstream. • This keeps your blood sugar within a standard range until you eat again. • Your body also has the ability to make glucose. • This process occurs mainly in your liver, but also in your kidneys. • With prolonged fasting, the body can break down fat stores and use products of fat breakdown as an alternative fuel. • If you have diabetes, you might not make insulin (type 1 diabetes) or you might be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). • As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream and can reach dangerously high levels. • To correct this problem, you might take insulin or other medications to lower blood sugar levels. • But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too much, causing hypoglycemia. • Hypoglycemia can also occur if you eat less than usual after taking your regular dose of diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you typically do. • Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. • Causes can include: Medications. • Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. • Other medications can cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. • One example is quinine (Qualaquin), used to treat malaria. • Excessive alcohol drinking. • Drinking heavily without eating can keep the liver from releasing glucose from its glycogen stores into the bloodstream. • This can lead to hypoglycemia. • Some critical illnesses. • Severe liver illnesses such as severe hepatitis or cirrhosis, severe infection, kidney disease, and advanced heart disease can cause hypoglycemia. • Kidney disorders also can keep your body from properly excreting medications. • This can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of medications that lower blood sugar levels. • Long-term starvation. • Hypoglycemia can occur with malnutrition and starvation when you don't get enough food, and the glycogen stores your body needs to create glucose are used up. • An eating disorder called anorexia nervosa is one example of a condition that can cause hypoglycemia and result in long-term starvation. • Insulin overproduction. • A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) can cause you to produce too much insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. • Other tumors also can result in too much production of insulin-like substances. • Unusual cells of the pancreas that produce insulin can result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia. • Hormone deficiencies. • Certain adrenal gland and pituitary tumor disorders can result in an inadequate amount of certain hormones that regulate glucose production or metabolism. • Children can have hypoglycemia if they have too little growth hormone. • Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten, but not always. • Sometimes hypoglycemia symptoms occur after certain meals, but exactly why this happens is uncertain. • This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive hypoglycemia or postprandial hypoglycemia, can occur in people who have had surgeries that interfere with the usual function of the stomach. • The surgery most commonly associated with this is stomach bypass surgery, but it can also occur in people who have had other surgeries. • Untreated hypoglycemia can lead to: Seizure Coma Death Hypoglycemia can also cause: Dizziness and weakness Falls Injuries Motor vehicle accidents Greater risk of dementia in older adults Over time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness. • The body and brain no longer produce signs and symptoms that warn of a low blood sugar, such as shakiness or irregular heartbeats (palpitations). • When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia increases. • If you have diabetes, recurring episodes of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness, your health care provider might modify your treatment, raise your blood sugar level goals and recommend blood glucose awareness training. • A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is an option for some people with hypoglycemia unawareness. • The device can alert you when your blood sugar is too low. • If you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar are uncomfortable and can be frightening. • Fear of hypoglycemia can cause you to take less insulin to ensure that your blood sugar level doesn't go too low. • This can lead to uncontrolled diabetes. • Talk to your health care provider about your fear, and don't change your diabetes medication dose without discussing changes with your health care provider. • Follow the diabetes management plan you and your health care provider have developed. • If you're taking new medications, changing your eating or medication schedules, or adding new exercise, talk to your health care provider about how these changes might affect your diabetes management and your risk of low blood sugar. • Learn the signs and symptoms you experience with low blood sugar. • This can help you identify and treat hypoglycemia before it gets too low. • Frequently checking your blood sugar level lets you know when your blood sugar is getting low. • A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a good option for some people. • A CGM has a tiny wire that's inserted under the skin that can send blood glucose readings to a receiver. • If blood sugar levels are dropping too low, some CGM models will alert you with an alarm. • Some insulin pumps are now integrated with CGMs and can shut off insulin delivery when blood sugar levels are dropping too quickly to help prevent hypoglycemia. • Be sure to always have a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, such as juice, hard candy or glucose tablets so that you can treat a falling blood sugar level before it dips dangerously low. • For recurring episodes of hypoglycemia, eating frequent small meals throughout the day is a stopgap measure to help prevent blood sugar levels from getting too low. • However, this approach isn't advised as a long-term strategy. • Work with your health care provider to identify and treat the cause of hypoglycemia.",

      "Overview": "Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. • Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells. • In hyponatremia, one or more factors — ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water — cause the sodium in your body to become diluted. • When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. • This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening. • Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. • Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. • In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications.",
      "Symptoms": "Hyponatremia signs and symptoms may include: Nausea and vomiting Headache Confusion Loss of energy, drowsiness and fatigue Restlessness and irritability Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps Seizures Coma Seek emergency care for anyone who develops severe signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures, or lost consciousness. • Call your doctor if you know you are at risk of hyponatremia and are experiencing nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness. • Depending on the extent and duration of these signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care. • Sodium plays a key role in your body. • It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. • A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). • Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below 135 mEq/L. • Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: Certain medications. • Some medications, such as some water pills (diuretics), antidepressants and pain medications, can interfere with the normal hormonal and kidney processes that keep sodium concentrations within the healthy normal range. • Heart, kidney and liver problems. • Congestive heart failure and certain diseases affecting the kidneys or liver can cause fluids to accumulate in your body, which dilutes the sodium in your body, lowering the overall level. • Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). • In this condition, high levels of the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) are produced, causing your body to retain water instead of excreting it normally in your urine. • Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea and other causes of dehydration. • This causes your body to lose electrolytes, such as sodium, and also increases ADH levels. • Drinking too much water. • Drinking excessive amounts of water can cause low sodium by overwhelming the kidneys' ability to excrete water. • Because you lose sodium through sweat, drinking too much water during endurance activities, such as marathons and triathlons, can also dilute the sodium content of your blood. • Hormonal changes. • Adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease) affects your adrenal glands' ability to produce hormones that help maintain your body's balance of sodium, potassium and water. • Low levels of thyroid hormone also can cause a low blood-sodium level. • The recreational drug Ecstasy. • This amphetamine increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia. • The following factors may increase your risk of hyponatremia: Age. • Older adults may have more contributing factors for hyponatremia, including age-related changes, taking certain medications and a greater likelihood of developing a chronic disease that alters the body's sodium balance. • Certain drugs. • Medications that increase your risk of hyponatremia include thiazide diuretics as well as some antidepressants and pain medications. • In addition, the recreational drug Ecstasy has been linked to fatal cases of hyponatremia. • Conditions that decrease your body's water excretion. • Medical conditions that may increase your risk of hyponatremia include kidney disease, syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, among others. • Intensive physical activities. • People who drink too much water while taking part in marathons, ultramarathons, triathlons and other long-distance, high-intensity activities are at an increased risk of hyponatremia. • In chronic hyponatremia, sodium levels drop gradually over 48 hours or longer — and symptoms and complications are typically more moderate. • In acute hyponatremia, sodium levels drop rapidly — resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in a coma and death. • Premenopausal women appear to be at the greatest risk of hyponatremia-related brain damage. • This may be related to the effect of women's sex hormones on the body's ability to balance sodium levels. • The following measures may help you prevent hyponatremia: Treat associated conditions. • Getting treatment for conditions that contribute to hyponatremia, such as adrenal gland insufficiency, can help prevent low blood sodium. • Educate yourself. • If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of hyponatremia or you take diuretic medications, be aware of the signs and symptoms of low blood sodium. • Always talk with your doctor about the risks of a new medication. • Take precautions during high-intensity activities. • Athletes should drink only as much fluid as they lose due to sweating during a race. • Thirst is generally a good guide to how much water or other fluids you need. • Consider drinking sports beverages during demanding activities. • Ask your doctor about replacing water with sports beverages that contain electrolytes when participating in endurance events such as marathons, triathlons and other demanding activities. • Drink water in moderation. • Drinking water is vital for your health, so make sure you drink enough fluids. • But don't overdo it. • Thirst and the color of your urine are usually the best indications of how much water you need. • If you're not thirsty and your urine is

      "Overview": "Hypopituitarism is a rare condition in which the pituitary gland doesn't make one or more hormones or doesn't make enough hormones. • The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland at the base of your brain. • It is part of the body's system of glands that make hormones, called the endocrine system. • The pituitary gland makes several hormones. • They act on nearly every part of the body. • Hypopituitarism is when there isn't enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. • This lack of hormones, called a deficiency, can affect how the body works in many ways. • These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others. • Symptoms depend on which hormones are missing. • People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives. • These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. • They might not be noticed for months or even years. • But for some people, symptoms start suddenly. • Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. • Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. • There might be more than one hormone that's low. • A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. • Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms. • In children, GH deficiency can cause growth problems and short stature. • Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have symptoms. • But some adults have: Fatigue. • Muscle weakness. • Changes in body fat. • Loss of interest in activities. • Lack of social contacts. • A lack of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affects the reproductive system. • The lack of hormones keeps the ovaries from making enough eggs and estrogen. • It keeps the testicles from making enough sperm and testosterone. • This can lower sex drive and cause tiredness. • It also can make it hard or impossible to have children — a condition called infertility. • In children, the physical changes to an adult body, known as puberty, may not occur or may be late. • Some people might have symptoms such as: Hot flashes. • Irregular periods or no periods. • Loss of pubic hair. • Not being able to make milk for breastfeeding. • Not being able to get or keep an erection, known as erectile dysfunction. • Decreased facial or body hair. • Mood changes. • Fatigue. • This hormone controls the thyroid gland. • Too little TSH leads to low levels of thyroid hormones. • This condition is called hypothyroidism. • It causes symptoms such as: Tiredness. • Weight gain. • Dry skin. • Constipation. • Sensitivity to cold or trouble staying warm. • This hormone helps the adrenal glands work correctly. • It also helps the body react to stress. • Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: Severe tiredness. • Low blood pressure. • Many and lasting infections. • Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. • Confusion. • This hormone, which also is called vasopressin, helps the body balance its fluid levels. • An ADH deficiency can lead to a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: Urinating more than usual. • Extreme thirst. • Imbalances in minerals such as sodium and potassium, known as electrolytes. • Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. • Low levels of prolactin can cause problems with making milk for breastfeeding. • See your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of hypopituitarism. • Contact your health care provider right away if symptoms of hypopituitarism start suddenly or come with a bad headache, changes in vision, confusion or a drop in blood pressure. • These could be symptoms of sudden damage to the pituitary gland tissue. • This condition is known as pituitary apoplexy. • Bleeding into the pituitary gland can cause pituitary apoplexy. • Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency and needs medical attention quickly.",
      "Causes": "Hypopituitarism has a number of causes. • One common cause is a tumor of the pituitary gland. • As a pituitary tumor grows, it can press on and damage pituitary tissue. • This disrupts the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. • A tumor also can press on the optic nerves, causing vision problems. • Other potential causes of damage to the pituitary gland that may lead to hypopituitarism include: Lack of blood flow to the brain or pituitary gland, known as a stroke, or bleeding, called hemorrhage, into the brain or pituitary gland. • Certain medicines, such as narcotics, high-dose steroids or certain cancer medicines called checkpoint inhibitors. • Swelling, known as inflammation, of the pituitary gland caused by an unusual immune system response, called hypophysitis. • Infections of the brain, such as meningitis, or infections that can spread to the brain, such as tuberculosis or syphilis. • Significant blood loss during childbirth, which can damage the front part of the pituitary gland. • This condition is known as Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary necrosis. • In some cases, a change in a gene causes hypopituitarism. • That change is heredity, which means it is passed down in families. • The genetic change affects the pituitary gland's ability to make one or more of its hormones. • This often starts at birth or in early childhood. • Tumors or diseases of a part of the brain that's just above the pituitary, called the hypothalamus, also can cause hypopituitarism. • The hypothalamus makes hormones that affect how the pituitary gland works. • Sometimes, the cause of hypopituitarism isn't known.",
      "Risk factors": "Most people with hypopituitarism don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing the condition. • But the following may raise the risk of developing hypopituitarism: A head injury. • Brain surgery. • Radiation treatment to the head or neck. • Diseases that affect more than one part of the body. • These include an inflammatory disease that affects various organs, called sarcoidosis; a disease in which unusual cells cause scarring, called Langerhans cell histiocytosis; and a disease that causes too much iron in the liver and other tissues, called hemochromatosis."

      "Overview": "Hypospadias (hi-poe-SPAY-dee-us) is a condition that happens as the unborn baby, called a fetus, develops in the womb. • The opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. • The urethra is the tube that drains urine from the bladder and out of the body. • Hypospadias is common and doesn't cause difficulty in caring for your baby. • Surgery usually can create a typical looking penis that works properly. • With successful treatment of hypospadias, most men can pass urine properly. • And with successful hypospadias treatment, the condition won't block sperm from fertilizing an egg.",
      "Symptoms": "In hypospadias, the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. • In most cases, the opening of the urethra is within the head of the penis. • Less often, the opening is at the middle or the base of the penis. • Rarely, the opening is in or beneath the scrotum. • Symptoms of hypospadias may include: Opening of the urethra at a place other than the tip of the penis. • Downward curve of the penis. • This condition is called chordee. • Hooded appearance of the penis because only the top half of the penis is covered by foreskin. • Differences in spraying when passing urine. • Most babies with hypospadias are diagnosed soon after birth while still in the hospital. • But it may be harder to identify hypospadias if there's only a slight change in where the urethral opening is. • Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have concerns about the look of your child's penis or if your child has problems passing urine. • Hypospadias is a condition that is present at birth. • As the penis develops in a male unborn baby, certain hormones stimulate how the urethra and foreskin form. • Hypospadias results from a change in the action of these hormones. • This keeps the two sides of the urethral folds from joining completely. • The location of the urethral opening depends on when the joining stopped. • In most cases, the exact cause of hypospadias is not known. • Sometimes, hypospadias is caused by gene changes, but environment also may play a role. • Although the cause of hypospadias is usually not known, these factors may be linked with the condition: Family history. • This condition is more common in babies with a family history of hypospadias. • Genetics. • Some gene changes may play a role in changing the hormones that stimulate how the male genitals develop. • Maternal age over 35. • Some research suggests that there may be a higher risk of hypospadias in male babies born to women older than 35 years. • Exposure to certain substances during pregnancy. • A link between hypospadias and a mother's exposure to certain hormones or certain compounds such as pesticides or industrial chemicals is being looked at. • But more research is needed to confirm this link. • If hypospadias is not treated, it can result in: Differences in how the penis looks. • Problems learning to use a toilet. • Unusual curve of the penis with an erection. • Problems releasing sperm from the penis. • This release is called an ejaculation.",

      "Overview": "Hypothermia is a condition that occurs when core body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). • It is a medical emergency. • In hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh), the body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. • Regular body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). • When body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system and other organs can't work as well as they usually do. • Left untreated, hypothermia can cause the heart and respiratory system to fail and eventually can lead to death. • Common causes of hypothermia include exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. • Treatment for hypothermia includes methods to warm the body back to a regular temperature.",
      "Symptoms": "When the temperature starts to drop, the body can start to shiver. • Shivering is the body's attempt to warm itself. • It is an automatic defense against cold temperature. • Symptoms of hypothermia include: Shivering. • Slurred speech or mumbling. • Slow, shallow breathing. • Weak pulse. • Clumsiness or lack of coordination. • Drowsiness or very low energy. • Confusion or memory loss. • Loss of consciousness. • In infants, bright red, cold skin. • People with hypothermia usually aren't aware of their condition. • The symptoms often begin gradually. • Also, the confused thinking associated with hypothermia prevents self-awareness. • The confused thinking also can lead to risk-taking behavior. • Call 911 or your local emergency number if you suspect someone has hypothermia. • While waiting for emergency help to arrive, gently move the person inside if possible. • Jarring movements can trigger dangerous irregular heartbeats. • Carefully remove any wet clothing and replace it with warm, dry coats or blankets. • Hypothermia occurs when the body loses heat faster than it produces it. • The most common causes of hypothermia are exposure to cold-weather conditions or cold water. • But prolonged exposure to any environment colder than the body can lead to hypothermia if a person isn't dressed properly or can't control the conditions. • Specific conditions leading to hypothermia include: Wearing clothes that aren't warm enough for weather conditions. • Staying out in the cold too long. • Being unable to get out of wet clothes or move to a warm, dry location. • Falling into the water, such as in a boating accident. • Living in a house that's too cold, either from poor heating or too much air conditioning. • The mechanisms of heat loss from the body include: Radiated heat. • Most heat loss is due to heat radiated from unprotected surfaces of the body. • Direct contact. • Direct contact with something very cold takes heat away from the body. • Examples include contact with cold water or the cold ground. • Because water is very good at transferring heat from the body, body heat is lost much faster in cold water than in cold air. • Similarly, heat loss from the body is much faster if clothes are wet, as from being caught out in the rain. • Wind. • Wind removes body heat by carrying away the thin layer of warm air at the surface of the skin. • A wind chill factor is important in causing heat loss. • Risk factors for hypothermia include: Exhaustion. • Fatigue reduces a person's ability to tolerate cold. • Older age. • The body's ability to regulate temperature and to sense cold may lessen with age. • And some older adults may not be able to tell someone when they are cold or to move to a warm location if they do feel cold. • Very young age. • Children lose heat faster than adults do. • Children also may ignore the cold because they're having too much fun to think about it. • They may not have the judgment to dress properly in cold weather or to get out of the cold when they should. • Mental conditions. • People with a mental illness, dementia or other conditions that interfere with judgment may not dress properly for the weather or understand the risk of cold weather. • People with dementia may wander from home or get lost easily, making them more likely to be stranded outside in cold or wet weather. • Alcohol and drug use. • Alcohol may make the body feel warm inside, but it causes blood vessels to expand. • As a result, the surface of the skin loses heat more rapidly. • Alcohol also reduces the body's natural shivering response. • In addition, the use of alcohol or recreational drugs can affect judgment about the need to get inside or wear warm clothes in cold-weather conditions. • A person who is intoxicated and passes out in cold weather is likely to develop hypothermia. • Certain medical conditions. • Some health disorders affect the body's ability to regulate body temperature. • Examples include an underactive thyroid, also called hypothyroidism; poor nutrition or anorexia nervosa; diabetes; stroke; severe arthritis; Parkinson's disease; trauma; and spinal cord injuries. • Medicines. • Some drugs can change the body's ability to regulate its temperature. • Examples include certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, narcotic pain medicines and sedatives. • People who develop hypothermia because of exposure to cold weather or cold water are also vulnerable to other cold-related injuries, including: Frostbite, which is when skin and underlying tissues become frozen. • Gangrene, which is when body tissue decays and dies because blood flow is blocked. • To stay warm in cold weather, remember the acronym COLD — cover, overexertion, layers, dry: Cover. • Wear a hat or other protective covering to prevent body heat from escaping from your head, face and neck. • Cover your hands with mittens instead of gloves. • Overexertion. • Avoid activities that cause a lot of sweat. • The combination of wet clothing and cold weather can cause the body to lose heat more quickly. • Layers. • Wear loosefitting, layered, lightweight clothing. • Outer clothing made of tightly woven, water-repellent material is best for wind protection. • Wool, silk or polypropylene inner layers hold body heat better than cotton does. • Dry. • Stay as dry as possible. • Get out of wet clothing as soon as possible. • Be especially careful to keep your hands and feet dry, as it's easy for snow to get into mittens and boots. • To help prevent hypothermia when children are outside in the winter: Dress infants and young children in one more layer than an adult would wear in the same conditions. • Bring children indoors if they start shivering — that's the first sign that hypothermia is starting. • Have children come inside often to warm themselves when they're playing outside. • Don't let babies sleep in a cold room. • When traveling during bad weather, be sure someone knows where you're headed and at what time you're expected to arrive. • That way, if you get into trouble on your way, emergency responders will know where to look for your car. • It's also a good idea to keep emergency supplies in the car in case you get stranded. • Supplies may include several blankets, matches, candles, a clean can where you can melt snow into drinking water, a first-aid kit, dry or canned food, a can opener, tow rope, booster cables, a compass, and a bag of sand or kitty litter to spread for traction if the car gets stuck in the snow. • If possible, travel with a cellphone. • If you're stranded, put everything you need in the car with you, huddle together and stay covered. • Run the car for 10 minutes each hour to warm it up. • Make sure a window is slightly open and the exhaust pipe isn't covered with snow while the engine is running. • To avoid alcohol-related risks of hypothermia, don't drink alcohol: If you're going to be outside in cold weather. • If you're boating. • Before going to bed on cold nights. • Water doesn't have to be extremely cold to cause hypothermia. • Any water that's colder than usual body temperature causes heat loss. • The following tips may increase your survival time in cold water if you accidentally fall in: Wear a life jacket. • If you plan to ride in a watercraft, wear a life jacket. • A life jacket can help you stay alive longer in cold water by enabling you to float without using energy and by providing some insulation. • Keep a whistle attached to your life jacket to signal for help. • Get out of the water if possible. • Get out of the water as much as possible, such as climbing onto a capsized boat or grabbing onto a floating object. • Don't attempt to swim unless you're close to safety. • Unless a boat, another person or a life jacket is close by, stay put. • Swimming uses up energy and may shorten survival time. • Position the body to minimize heat loss. • Use a body position known as the heat escape lessening posture (HELP) to reduce heat loss while you wait for help. • Hold your knees to your chest to protect the trunk of the body. • If your life jacket forces your face down into the water when in this position, straighten your legs and bring them tightly together, hold your arms to your sides, and tilt your head back. • Huddle with others. • If you've fallen into cold water with other people, keep warm by facing the others in a tight circle. • Don't remove clothing. • While you're in the water, don't remove clothing because it helps to insulate you from the water. • Buckle, button and zip up your clothes. • Cover your head if possible. • Remove clothing only after you're safely out of the water and can take measures to get dry and warm. • Community outreach programs and social support services can be of great help for people most at risk of hypothermia. • This includes infants, older adults, people who have mental or physical health conditions, and people who are homeless. • If you are at risk or know someone at risk, contact your local public health office for available services, such as the following: Help with paying heating bills. • Check-in services to see if you and your home are warm enough during cold weather. • Homeless shelters. • Community warming centers, safe and warm daytime locations where you can go during cold weather.",

      "Overview": "Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. • This condition also is called underactive thyroid. • Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. • Over time, hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, such as high cholesterol and heart problems. • Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. • Treatment with thyroid hormone medicine usually is simple, safe and effective once you and your health care provider find the right dosage for you.",
      "Symptoms": "The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. • Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. • At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. • Or you may think they are just part of getting older. • But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. • Hypothyroidism symptoms may include: Tiredness. • More sensitivity to cold. • Constipation. • Dry skin. • Weight gain. • Puffy face. • Hoarse voice. • Coarse hair and skin. • Muscle weakness. • Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. • Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. • Thinning hair. • Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. • Depression. • Memory problems. • Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. • Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. • But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. • They may include: Feeding problems. • Poor growth. • Poor weight gain. • Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice. • Constipation. • Poor muscle tone. • Dry skin. • Hoarse crying. • Enlarged tongue. • A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia. • When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems. • In general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. • But they also may have: Poor growth that leads to short stature. • Delayed development of permanent teeth. • Delayed puberty. • Poor mental development. • See your health care provider if you're feeling tired for no reason or if you have other symptoms of hypothyroidism. • If you're taking thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism, follow your health care provider's advice on how often you need medical appointments. • At first, you may need regular appointments to make sure you're receiving the right dose of medicine. • Over time, you may need checkups so that your health care provider can monitor your condition and medicine. • The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. • The thyroid gland makes two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). • These hormones affect every cell in the body. • They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. • They help control body temperature. • They have an effect on heart rate. • And they help control how much protein the body makes. • Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. • Conditions or problems that can lead to hypothyroidism include: Autoimmune disease. • The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's disease. • Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues. • Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones. • Thyroid surgery. • Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland can lower the gland's ability to make thyroid hormones or stop it completely. • Radiation therapy. • Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism. • Thyroiditis. • Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. • This may be due to an infection. • Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid. • Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once. • That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism. • Afterward, the thyroid becomes underactive. • Medicine. • A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. • One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. • If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland. • Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by: Problems present at birth. • Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. • Others are born with no thyroid gland. • In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. • But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. • Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. • That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening. • Pituitary disorder. • A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). • This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland. • Pregnancy. • Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. • If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. • Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. • Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus. • Not enough iodine. • The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. • Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. • Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. • Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. • In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. • The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States. • Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you: Are a woman. • Have a family history of thyroid disease. • Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease. • Have received treatment for hyperthyroidism. • Received radiation to your neck or upper chest. • Have had thyroid surgery. • Hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, including: Goiter. • Hypothyroidism may cause the thyroid gland to become larger. • This condition is called a goiter. • A large goiter may cause problems with swallowing or breathing. • Heart problems. • Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure. • That's mainly because people with an underactive thyroid tend to develop high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the \"bad\" cholesterol. • Peripheral neuropathy. • Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves. • These are the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. • Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs. • Infertility. • Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility. • Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility. • Birth defects. • Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease. • Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. • But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent. • Myxedema coma. • This rare, life-threatening condition can happen when hypothyroidism goes without treatment for a long time. • A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on the body. • Its symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by an extreme lack of energy and then unconsciousness. • Myxedema coma requires emergency medical treatment.",
      "Causes": "The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. • The thyroid gland makes two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). • These hormones affect every cell in the body. • They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. • They help control body temperature. • They have an effect on heart rate. • And they help control how much protein the body makes. • Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. • Conditions or problems that can lead to hypothyroidism include: Autoimmune disease. • The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's disease. • Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues. • Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones. • Thyroid surgery. • Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland can lower the gland's ability to make thyroid hormones or stop it completely. • Radiation therapy. • Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism. • Thyroiditis. • Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. • This may be due to an infection. • Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid. • Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once. • That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism. • Afterward, the thyroid becomes underactive. • Medicine. • A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. • One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. • If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland. • Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by: Problems present at birth. • Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. • Others are born with no thyroid gland. • In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. • But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. • Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. • That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening. • Pituitary disorder. • A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). • This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland. • Pregnancy. • Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. • If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. • Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. • Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus. • Not enough iodine. • The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. • Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. • Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. • Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. • In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. • The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States.",
